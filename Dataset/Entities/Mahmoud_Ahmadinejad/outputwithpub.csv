2005-06-19,"As mayor of Tehran from 2003 , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has spearheaded a crackdown on the social freedoms that flourished during Mohammed Khatami 's presidency .
This role - highly unpopular among secular Iranians - provided the platform for a run at the presidency by an obscure figure whose only previous political experience was as governor of Ardebil , a small north - western province .
Mr Ahmadinejad has been able to appeal to influential elements in the Islamic power structure with his image of studied modesty .
While other candidates have run flashy , even western - style campaigns , Mr Ahmadinejad 's has been ascetic - in line with his humble Islamist appearance .
During his time as mayor , Mr Ahmadinejad has been seen donning workers ' overalls and sweeping the streets , bolstering his image as a man of the people .
Apart from social crackdowns , his term as Tehran mayor has been marked by an attempt to improve local services and upgrade a chaotic traffic system .
A hint that his star might be on the rise came last week when a representative of Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , urged voters to elect a candidate who had run a humble campaign .
Mr Ahmadinejad , 49 , is said to have two main constituencies : religious hardliners and working - class conservatives troubled by modernisation and the shift from traditionalism .
One of seven children , he joined the hard - core revolutionary guards in 1986 after volunteering to serve in the war with Iraq .
His Islamic credentials are said to be beyond challenge .
He was co - founder of the Islamic Society of Students , and he has been an instructor for the Basij , the youth volunteer organisation that enforces the Islamic Republic 's strict religious mores ."
2005-06-19,"Iran 's presidential election was propelled into a historic second - round run - off yesterday , after voters failed to choose an outright winner but confounded the pollsters by backing a hardliner ahead of reformists .
The former president , Iran 's most famous statesman Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , will now enter a head - to - head race against Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the little known , ultra - hardline Tehran mayor , who emerged in a surprise second place .
Ahmadinejad was almost half a million votes ahead of the third - placed Mehdi Karroubi , a moderate elderly cleric and former parliamentary Speaker .
An election run - off , Iran 's first since the 1979 Islamic revolution , is scheduled for Friday .
The experienced Rafsanjani , the strong favourite during the campaign , has pledged better ties with the West , while Ahmadinejad , who appeals to the pious poor , is wary of re - opening talks with Washington .
Rafsanjani won around 21 per cent of the vote .
Ahmadinejad got 19.5 per cent .
Ahmadinejad 's performance surprised many , as opinion polls had placed him well down the list of seven candidates .
But his reputation as a man of the people fiercely loyal to Iran 's system of clerical rule appeared to have won him strong support in rural areas and among the urban poor , for whom unemployment and the cost of living are the main concerns .
The leading reformist candidate , Mostafa Moin - who had hoped to finish second and force a run - off with Rafsanjani - finished fifth with 13.8 per cent , behind Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf , a former national police chief and Revolutionary Guards air force commander , who was previously considered the leading hardline candidate .
The Interior Ministry said 63 per cent of Iran 's 47 million registered voters had voted .
That figure was hailed as a triumph by the Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who had called for a high turnout to display Iran 's democratic credentials in the face of American and European pressure over its nuclear programme and human rights record . '
With your wise participation in the elections , you have once again announced your strong will to be independent , defend Islamic values and have an Islamic democracy , ' Khamenei told voters .
President George Bush denounced the election in advance last week as unfair .
Reformists , stunned by the poor showing of their favourite Mostafa Moin , a former education minister , debated whether to throw their weight behind Rafsanjani .
Many of Moin 's supporters had complained of having being assaulted and having their election meetings broken up by hardline vigilantes .
Moin had promised to release political prisoners and review human rights .
At a hastily arranged news conference Ahmadinejad criticised opponents for spending large sums on slick television adverts and organising rallies featuring pop music and girls wearing skimpy dress considered immoral by religious conservatives . '
I am the people 's candidate because people helped my campaign centres and in my campaign centres we did not spend billions ( of Iranian rials ) , ' he said .
Allegations of vote rigging abounded yesterday . '
I assume there will be others who smell a rat , ' said Patrick Clawson , at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy ."
2005-06-19,"Iran 's presidential election was thrown into uncharted territory yesterday after a hardline candidate who unexpectedly won his way into a run - off vote was accused of ballot - rigging .
The allegations against the ultra - conservative mayor of Tehran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , 49 , came not only from losing candidates in Friday 's first round , but also from aides to the frontrunner , the pragmatic cleric and former president , Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani .
Mr Rafsanjani 's suspicions have intensified the controversy surrounding Mr Ahmadinejad 's surprise showing .
He confounded pollsters to capture nearly 20 % of the vote .
Mr Rafsanjani polled 21 % .
The mayor , a former revolutionary guard commander , wants to reinforce Iran 's strict Islamic code .
Mr Rafsanjani 's aides say Mr Ahmadinejad may have stuffed ballot boxes , bought votes and used improper influence on the guardian council , the religious watchdog overseeing the election .
"" We are suspicious .
We feel that he was not so popular as to gain this number of votes , "" said Amir Mohseni , deputy head of Mr Rafsanjani 's campaign in Tehran .
"" We are trying to build up evidence .
We are interviewing voters and trying to get information from official sources , such as the guardian council and the interior ministry .
Under the law , we are able to present complaints against the procedure of the election and we are going to take that opportunity . ""
Mr Rafsanjani 's campaign managers fear that such abuses - if true - may be repeated in this Friday 's run - off .
The campaign 's complaints bolster those of Mehdi Karroubi , a moderate cleric who finished third , and the leading reformist , Mostafa Moin , who came fifth after a campaign in which many of his supporters were attacked and beaten by religious vigilantes .
Analysts also expressed deep scepticism .
"" I can not believe that Ahmadinejad won 5.7 m votes , "" one commentator said .
"" I think he got one million extra votes from somewhere .
I have serious doubts about these results . ""
Mr Karroubi , who had seemed poised during Saturday 's count to finish second after a populist promise to pay every Iranian £ 30 to alleviate poverty , said : "" Money has changed hands . ""
I see this election as being rigged .
Some people affiliated to the revolutionary guards and some others exercise influence over the guardian council .
I want them to sue me , so I would be able to expose their names in my defence . ""
Mr Moin 's Islamic Iran Participation Front accused the guardian council of funding an £ 8 m campaign to mobilise 300,000 Islamic militias to ensure a hardliner 's success . ""
Take seriously the danger of fascism , "" Mr Moin said .
"" Such creeping and complex attempts will eventually lead to militarism , authoritarianism as well as social and political suffocation in the country . ""
Critics pointed to other irregularities , including Mr Ahmadinejad 's announcement on Saturday that he would be in the run - off , hours before official results were issued .
Mr Ahmadinejad dismissed the claims .
"" I would expect a respected cleric to be more tolerant and accurate , "" he said of Mr Karroubi .
The interior ministry said 62 % of Iran 's 47 million voters had taken part in the poll .
There were 1.2 m spoiled ballots - a high number that may reflect widespread disenchantment with the Islamic system in a country where public - sector employees are obliged to vote and get an electoral stamp in their identity booklets .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's young supporters in the Basij , the hardcore of volunteers which enforces Iran 's Islamic dress code and separation of the sexes , celebrated into the early hours yesterday , chanting slogans in the same Tehran parks where secular Iranians staged eve - of - poll parties .
Condoleezza Rice , the US secretary of state , said yesterday during her tour of the Middle East that the election was not a serious step towards democracy : "" Any election in which thousands of people are disqualified by fiat , and in which women are disqualified as a class , barely deserves to be given that title , particularly in a place that several years ago seemed to be moving in a different direction . """
2005-06-20,"In the shadow of the glittering Shah Abdul Azim shrine , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the unexpected contender in the Iranian presidential run - offs , is seen as a pious working - class hero .
"" We can identify with him .
His style is humble and not luxurious , "" said Mehdi Nasrollahi , 32 , a stallholder selling the Qur'an and assorted Islamic mementoes in Shahr - e Rey bazaar outside the shrine , which is the resting place for some of the most revered figures in Shia Islam .
Mr Nasrollahi 's firm convictions were reinforced by four posters depicting Mr Ahmadinejad 's ascetic and undeniably Islamic features .
Such expressions of support provided a populist antidote yesterday to the allegations of electoral malpractice swirling around Mr Ahmadinejad 's performance in the Iranian presidential election , where he upset predictions to win a place in a second - round run - off ahead of better - known candidates .
The ultra - hardline mayor of Tehran 's surprise success has provoked bitter recriminations .
The election frontrunner , Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , described last Friday 's poll as "" tarnished "" while two other candidates , Mehdi Karroubi , a moderate cleric who finished third , and Mostafa Moin , the leading reformist , have accused Mr Ahmadinejad of buying votes .
Mr Ahmadinejad denies the allegations .
In response , the guardian council - the hardline watchdog overseeing the election - yesterday held a limited recount of the votes in 100 ballot boxes .
But it said there was no evidence of ballot rigging and that a run - off would be held on June 24 as planned , state television reported .
"" It has been clarified that there was no discrepancy in the election results , "" the report said , citing a letter from the head of the guardian council . ""
These allegations are just political bluff and game - playing to make sure the presidency goes to Rafsanjani , "" said Mr Nasrollahi , whose exhibits included the black - and - white chequered scarf of the hardline Basij religious militia , which Mr Ahmadinejad once served as an instructor .
"" My brother was in charge of one of the ballot boxes and he says there is no doubt Ahmadinejad won the most votes in Shahr - e Rey . ""
The allegations surrounding Mr Ahmadinejad , together with fear of his strident conservative views , have had the effect of mobilising an unlikely broad - based coalition behind Mr Rafsanjani ahead of Friday 's run - off .
Yesterday Mr Moin 's Islamic Iran Participation Front swung behind Mr Rafsanjani , along with the pro - reform Organisation of the Mujahedin of the Islamic Revolution .
They were joined by the Office to Coordinate Unity , a student body that had previously boycotted the election in protest at the barring of reformist candidates .
All now see Mr Rafsanjani - a former president and pillar of the Islamic revolution who has recast himself as a voice of moderate reform - as the protector of the limited social freedoms granted under President Mohammed Khatami 's outgoing reformist administration .
These freedoms - including the right of women to wear the hijab in a looser , more colourful fashion - do not cut much ice in working - class Shahr - e Rey , widely regarded as the most pious area around traditionally religious south Tehran .
"" Our society is not religious , there is moral corruption , "" said Mohsen Talebi , 30 , who works in an ice cream parlour .
"" There 's bad observation of the hijab .
That 's important in an Islamic society and it should not be like this . ""
But it is economic worries and class resentment that form the heart of Mr Ahmadinejad 's campaign .
He has appealed to the poor with his spartan approach as Tehran mayor .
Mr Ahmadinejad lives in a modest house and drives his own car , in contrast to rumours of Mr Rafsanjani 's fabulous wealth . ""
Unemployment , inflation and social discrimination are the factors Mr Ahmadinejad thinks should be taken into account , "" said his spokesman , Nader Shariatmadari .
"" A gap has emerged between different social classes and we have to find a solution .
Access to opportunity and privilege is not available to all the people . """
2005-06-20,"The Iranian authorities today ordered a partial recount of votes in the country 's close presidential election and stopped the publication of a reformist newspaper .
The moves came after reformists accused the military of rigging last Friday 's vote in favour of a candidate intending to reinforce Iran 's strict Islamic code .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the conservative mayor of Tehran , confounded expectations when he captured almost 20 % of the vote in the first round of polling .
Other candidates alleged the result had been due to vote - tampering by military organisations supporting the 49-year - old former Revolutionary Guard commander .
Iran 's official media today announced that 80 ballot boxes from the provinces of Tehran , Qom , Masshad and Isfahan would be chosen at random and recounted .
It is a small sampling - 42,000 polling stations have been set up throughout Iran , and each has at least one ballot box .
The random recount was ordered by Iran 's Guardian Council , which ordered the country 's interior ministry to carry it out .
It comes just four days ahead of an expected second round run - off between the leading candidates in Friday 's poll - Mr Ahmadinejad and the former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani .
The 70-year - old Mr Rafsanjani , once considered a hardliner , polled 21 % of the vote last week .
In his bid to regain the post he held from 1989 to 1997 , he rebranded himself as a liberal and said it was time to open a new chapter in Iran - US ties .
He also hinted that he would increase social and political freedoms .
The hardline controlled judiciary gave no reason for ordering the publication of today 's issue of the reformist Daily Eqbal .
However , a senior editor at the newspaper told the Associated Press he suspected it had been shut down to prevent the publication of a letter from the election candidate Mahdi Karroubi .
In it , Mr Karroubi said he would resign from the powerful Expediency Council , which arbitrates between the Guidance Council and parliament , because of election irregularities .
The Persian - language daily newspaper was also a high - profile supporter of Mostafa Moin , a former culture minister and the most moderate of the presidential candidates , who finished fifth in the race .
Friday 's run - off is the first since the Iranian revolution of 1979 , and takes place because no one candidate was able to secure the 50 % of the vote needed to win outright victory ."
2005-06-20,"The tone is largely one of despair on the pro - democracy Iran blogs today as the implications of Friday 's presidential election in Iran continue to be picked over .
There is much anguish about how the hardline mayor of Tehran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , came second and is now going to face the relatively moderate cleric Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjari in Friday 's second round run - off .
Some attack those who boycotted the elections rather than back reform candidates and argue that Mr Rafsanjari is now the least worst option .
There is also wide talk about the allegations of electoral fraud .
A big topic of debate is the open letter by Mehdi Karroubi , a moderate cleric who finished third , to the unelected supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , which claimed that Mr Ahmadinejad had been illegally supported by the military in the poll .
Two pro - reform newspapers , Eqbal and Aftab - e Yazd , have been shut down for printing the letter .
Mr Behi , of the The Adventures of Mr Behi , writes that he believes the letter is the "" first time that someone from within the system of power is complaining about the leader in such an open way "" .
Mr Behi says he hopes the closures will be short because they have been so well publicised .
He worries that there are "" horrible plans for every aspect of our lives "" if Mr Ahmadinejad becomes president .
They are so strict socially and will clash a lot with the youth who are already having problem with existing moderate government for the limitations it applies on their way of clothing and social mingling with opposite sex .
Winsteed , writing on Iran Votes 2005 , claims to have received reports from a number of towns that militia had been trying to "" encourage people "" to vote for Mr Ahmadinejad .
But Hossein Derakhshan , an Iranian who lives in Toronto but is currently in Tehran for the election , believes that Mr Ahmadinejad is going to prevail on Friday .
The pro - reform youth are so disappointed and depressed .
Nobody knows what will happen next .
But Khamenei is the biggest winner of this game .
He now has both the big turn - out ( plus a middle - finger to Bush ) , and a quasi - president who is only a cover for his excellency .
Derakhshan also wonders if there may be a coup and writes that "" things are getting nasty "" .
The only silver lining he can see is that an Ahmadinejad term could "" be that it would end the apathy among the youth born after the Iran - Iraq war "" .
Meanwhile , Trita Parsi , writing on Iran Scan , says people should not be surprised at what has happened .
We knew — though we so often forget — that 15–25 % of the Iranian population back the conservatives .
Much like the conservative movement in the US , the Iranian conservatives are better organised since they have traditional Iranian institutions and networks at their disposal .
And like their counterparts in the US , they vote in higher numbers and they are more disciplined voters .
Iran Scan links to an Associated Press piece carrying quotes from Iran 's intelligence minister , Ali Yunesi , who sarcastically thanked George Bush for his criticisms of the election .
Some analysts suggest Mr Bush 's pro - reform comments helped the hardliners .
"" I say to Bush : ' Thank you , ' ""
Mr Yunesi said .
"" He motivated people to vote in retaliation . """
2005-06-25,"His admirers hail him as Iran 's Robin Hood , his critics a religious extremist .
But yesterday Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became the president elect of Iran , basking in an electoral landslide few had foreseen and which put Islamic hardliners firmly in control .
Government figures showed more than 17 million votes for Ahmadinejad , 49 , the blacksmith 's son who has been mayor of Tehran since 2003 , compared with around 10 million for Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , the former president and favourite throughout the campaign who had gained the reluctant backing of the beleaguered reformist movement .
Charges of vote - rigging and other violations , which marred his surprise second - place showing in the election 's first round and resurfaced during Friday 's runoff , began to fade as Iranians absorbed a political earthquake that promises a re - assertion of Islamic values in Iran and a return to confrontation with the West .
The demise of Rafsanjani , who had presented himself as Iran 's last hope of preventing religious extremism , is a blow to many Western diplomats .
His senior advisers are believed to have held pre - election talks with British embassy officials in Tehran as part of plans for greater rapprochement with the West .
The result will increase Western concerns about Iran 's nuclear programme .
Ahmadinejad has described nuclear technology as the ' demand of the whole Iranian nation ' and accused the country 's negotiators of being ' frightened ' during talks with their EU counterparts .
After eight years of cautious liberalisation under Mohammed Khatami , Iranians now face an era of austere Islamist leadership .
Ahmadinejad is supported by the basij , a volunteer grassroots militia that acts as a vigilante force ensuring religious laws are observed .
Reformers have labelled his rise as a ' fascist ' militarist coup , but it was clear yesterday that his pledge to help Iran 's poor and crack down on rampant corruption had resonated with many .
During the campaign , he vowed to ' cut the hands off the mafias ' he says are in charge of the country 's oil industry and redistribute the revenues .
Equally important was the active support of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - the real centre of power in the Islamic republic .
That resulted in a mass vote mobilisation exercise spearheaded by basij leaders from mosques across the country . '
Ahmadinejad 's vote comes from two sections of the electorate , ' one Tehran - based analyst said . '
The first are genuine hard - core religious voters who rallied behind him when they realised that certain people were supporting him in the Revolutionary Guards . '
The second part belonged to the forces of tradition .
These are people who have difficulties coping with the changes in society .
They want somebody who appears modest and honest . '
It all amounts to a meteoric rise for a man whose name does not even appear in the most recent edition of Iran 's political
Who 's Who .
Born the fourth of seven children in Garmsar , 60 miles south of Tehran , Ahmadinejad moved to the capital with his family as a child .
While the shah was still on the throne , he took a BSc in civil engineering at Tehran 's University of Science and Industry , a religiously devout institution .
His Islamist credentials were honed while serving with the Revolutionary Guards during the eight - year war with Iraq during the 1980s .
He became governor of the north - western province of Ardebil in the 1990s , but was still a political novice when elected mayor of Tehran .
In that role , he used his PhD in traffic and transportation engineering to bring order to the city 's chaotic road network .
He lived in a modest house , in contrast to the conspicuous lifestyles enjoyed by other senior regime figures .
But the mostly secular better - off fear his presidency may herald a clampdown on already limited social freedoms , such as the mingling of the sexes and the right of women to wear hijab in a looser , more colourful style .
Ahmadinejad has dismissed such concerns , saying : ' The country 's true problem is employment and housing , not what to wear . '
His campaign advisers insist Khatami 's modest reforms will not be reversed and that private behaviour will not be regulated .
' We will never stop or prevent any movement which has taken Iran forward and we will never move back , ' his media spokesman , Dr Nader Shariatmadari , said . '
We respect people 's freedoms in the political , cultural and social realms within the framework of the law . '
What the people say Mehri Tajik , 22 , a management student in the Naziabad district of south Tehran . '
Ours is an Islamic society and Ahmadinejad is appropriate for us .
I would like him to provide housing for the youth , ease life for people in general and give freedom in a rational way within a framework
people can not go beyond .
Now we are very free , but people do n't appreciate it .
They do n't know what kind of freedom they want .
Our country is already religious and we do n't need to develop the religion we have already .
But we want to keep it , because there is no contradiction between religion and technology . '
Mehdi Mousavi , 22 , a soldier visiting the shrine of Hazrat - e Abdul Azim in Shahr - e Rey , south of Tehran . '
Ahmadinejad is efficient and has a good record .
He is from the basij , committed to the system , loyal to Islam and a follower of the Supreme Leader .
I would like him to follow the order of the Supreme Leader , which is fighting poverty , corruption and discrimination .
There is a social and individual discrimination , much of it imposed by the state .
There are many aspects of society not Islamic enough .
We have a problem with drug smuggling in the south . '"
2005-06-25,"He has been called pious , populist and proper , yet until little more than a week ago , no one thought him presidential .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , 49 , is seen as a champion of the poor , a modest man who drives his own car and has governed Tehran for two years as mayor with zealous austerity .
As president , he promises a sharp departure from the social freedoms that flourished during Muhammad Khatami 's presidency : as mayor he has spearheaded a social crackdown , riling secular Iranians .
Some fear his presidency will turn the clock back to a time when women had to dress conservatively and couples could not fraternise in public .
But away from the metropolis , Mr Ahmedinejad 's clean image and ascetic , working - class credentials are popular in a country where unemployment is rife .
As mayor of Tehran , he has also sought to improve local services and upgrade a chaotic traffic system .
A former military figure , he has also pledged to step up efforts to counter western "" decadence "" within Iran 's Islamic society .
One of seven children , he joined the hardcore revolutionary guards in 1986 after volunteering to serve in the war with Iraq .
His Islamic credentials are said to be beyond challenge .
He was co - founder of the Islamic Society of Students , and has been an instructor for the Basij , the youth volunteer organisation that enforces the Islamic republic 's strict religious mores ."
2005-06-26,"Mark Dooley Sunday Independent , Ireland , June 26
"" No one could have predicted the victory of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Iran 's presidential runoff last Friday .
But the ultra - conservative mayor of Tehran beat former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani by a landslide . ""
So how did this former revolutionary guard manage to defy the pollsters ? ...
Despite his apparent simplicity , he had the political and financial backing of the most powerful conservative clerics in Iran .
He got their support by using his position as Tehran 's mayor to rid the city of ' western decadence ' ...
For the student opposition and moderate clerics , however , he symbolised everything they had spent years trying to destroy ...
In Mr Ahmadinejad , they now have a president whose principal objective is to recapture the spirit of the 1979 Islamic revolution . ""
Amin Sabooni Iran Daily , June 26
"" It is not very difficult to understand why the powerful Mr Rafsanjani failed and Mr Ahmadinejad was elected president .
Tired , frustrated , thirsty for economic justice , and looking for real change , 17.2 million Iranians voted for the little - known mayor of Tehran ... who focused on issues that touch the lives of ordinary people .
Many things may not have been on his side to qualify him for the top job that millions found the charismatic Mr Rafsanjani unfit for .
But one thing was certainly on the side of the incoming president and that was resentment ... ""
At the root of our wretchedness , backwardness and misery , he said in his election manifesto , lay corruption , wholesale mismanagement and greed .
Promising to provide belated justice , Iran 's sixth president has gone out of his way to convey that he is a doer and will embark on a system that holds the top brass responsible for its actions or the lack of it . ""
Independent on Sunday Editorial , June 26
"" Nobody is arguing that Iran is a functioning democracy - far from it .
Nearly three decades after the Islamic revolution , the elected portion of the government remains subordinate to the stifling , impenetrable rule of an unelected theocracy , whose main characteristics are prickly nationalism and a poor grasp of economic management .
Their constant obstruction of the outgoing president , Mohammad Khatami , bred disillusionment among the urban elite , who supported his attempts at social liberalisation . ""
But stagnation and complacency have also brought corruption .
The paradoxical effect of this popular frustration has been the victory of the ultra - conservative Mr Ahmadinejad , a strong supporter of the clerics , who believes that Iran did not have a revolution ' in order to have democracy ' . ""
Arab News Editorial , Saudi Arabia , June 26 ""
This month unemployment reached a record 14.8 % .
An extraordinary half of all Iranian voters are under 25 - and the voting age is 15 .
In the next four years 5.5 million young Iranians are going to enter the job market .
Under these circumstances , it is easy to see where a large bloc of Mr Ahmadinejad 's electoral support came from .
There was also the new president 's assurances that he would crack down on graft and corruption . ""
Ordinary Iranians who formed the backbone of the 1979 revolution and filled the ranks of the army during the bloody eight - year war with Iraq have seen little in the way of economic benefit .
Mr Ahmadinejad , the son of a blacksmith , presented himself accurately as a man of the people .
He has been noted for his simple , almost austere lifestyle since his appointment as the capital 's mayor in 2003 .
"" Iran News Daily Editorial , June 26 "" Mr Ahmadinejad should recognise the heavy burden he has now inherited .
As the country 's chief executive , he does n't just represent his own ideology and faction , but indeed the entire nation .
Therefore , the new president should not settle political scores or eliminate rivals ...
"" Most [ of ] Mr Ahmadinejad 's voters were from the disadvantaged and deprived classes of Iranian society .
Therefore , he might feel his first loyalty is towards the underprivileged classes .
But the president - elect should take into account that one of the primary ways of helping the poor is by supporting industrialists , manufacturers and investors .
Indeed , without the entrepreneurial class risking its capital , jobs will not be created and the poverty - stricken will continue to remain poor . ""
Gulf News Editorial , United Arab Emirates , June 26
"" There is some fear that the new president will take an ultra - conservative line in his negotiations with the west , especially over ...
Iran 's nuclear programme .
However , it is too early to judge .
After all , Mr Ahmadinejad will not act alone , as whatever decisions he takes must have the approval of the Guardian Council and the Supreme Leader , who is the nation 's religious guide .
"" It is the first time that all organs of governance are in the hands of the conservatives .
Obviously , western nations will be cautious in their approach to Iran , watching carefully what takes place in the coming years , if not the next few months .

Iran 's pro - reform bloggers are today scrabbling around trying to work out where they go from here after hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's surprise victory in the presidential elections .
Some rail against the apathy of the young .
Others attack the reform movement in its entirety as a futile enterprise that only helps the theocratic system by safely draining away opposition .
One poster on a comment board on Hossein
"" Hoder "" Derakhshan 's Editor :
Myself blog writes : "" We are just seeing the true face of power in Iran , which has not changed one bit in the last 26 years .
While some reformers may have had great intentions , their legacy will be recorded in history as appeasing an inhumane system by giving it an appearance of legitimacy . ""
Frankly there is a sense of crisis among the middle class , wired - up , pro - reform bloggers at how out of touch they are with the people who voted in Mr Ahmadinejad .
Hoder wonders about how to better reach people and theorises that reformers need more exposure on satellite television .
The reform movement ca n't reach beyond a certain population .
They only have newspapers and Internet , with an approximate reach of five to seven millions .
While the regime has a monopoly on TV and radio , the reformists ca n't even reach the majority of the middle - class , especially the youth , who are not into reading anymore , let alone the lower - class in rural areas .
This view kindles a lively debate on Hoder 's comment board and draws criticism from one poster , Barmak Nikbakht , who argues that satellite is not the way to bring down a "" brutal dictatorship "" which will "" only collapse after alienating ring after ring of its base support "" .
Another poster called Behrooz says : "" Do you expect the so - called reformers in exile from abroad to spread their propaganda and expect people to really listen ?
They have no idea what it is to live in poverty from their lush homes in Los Angeles , Great Britain , etc . ""
However , a poster called Nazee , agrees with Hoder that the communication / information gap is important because it "" not only kept us apart from the pulse of the Iranian society but led us into a deluded image of ourselves and our country . ""
For the future , Nazee continues that "" the first step is perhaps to try and know our country ...
Ahmadinejad seems to have known it better than I , I must admit that with the deepest of regret "" .
Omid Memarian , an Iranian journalist , says that there was something "" soothing "" about Mr Ahmadinejad , and voters liked the clips of his modest home in his campaign video .
G , another poster on Hoder 's site , writes that for many poor Iranians "" liberal democracy is meaningless "" and "" for them the revolution had a real meaning , their support for Ahmedinejad is just their attempt to rekindle that flame "" .
But despite Mr Ahmadinejad 's apparent connection with the poor , none of the bloggers I read have any optimism that the new president elect can actually deliver on his promises to help the poor .
As Martin Woollacott writes in the Guardian today , Mr Ahmadinejad is to some degree as compromised by a corrupt regime as some of the reforming politicians and others who used their position to enrich themselves .
Woollacott says : "" Among the men who helped get Ahmadinejad in are many who have profited as much or almost as much .
Is Mr Clean going to go after them ? """
2005-06-27,"Iran 's new hardline president - elect , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , yesterday threw down a challenge to western leaders by vowing to resist international pressure to abandon the country 's nuclear programme and branding Israel the source of instability in the Middle East .
The remarks , made at his first press conference since a landslide victory , will underline concerns in America , Israel , Britain and other European countries , where wrongfooted diplomats have been scrambling to come to terms with the consequences of his win .
The rise of Mr Ahmadinejad , the ultra - Islamist mayor of Tehran who has expressed a desire to recreate the atmosphere of the early days of Iran 's 1979 revolution , has created alarm , not least because of fears it will be even harder to secure a diplomatic solution to the stand - off between Iran and the west over the country 's nuclear programme .
The British government has been dismayed by the election result , seeing it as a setback for its efforts along with France and Germany to secure a compromise .
A Foreign Office source , in a rare resort to undiplomatic language , referred to Mr Ahmadinejad as a "" headcase "" .
The Foreign Office spokesman elaborated , saying the official policy for the time being was to "" wait and see "" but that "" our analysis is this guy appears to be a throwback to the early 80s and that can not be a good thing "" .
The Israeli foreign minister , Silvan Shalom , who described the election as undemocratic , yesterday urged international action against Iran . ""
Faced with the Iranian nuclear threat , the international community must , more than before , formulate a unified and stern policy towards Iran , "" he said .
Israel , which has hinted that it might launch a unilateral military strike against Iran 's nuclear plants if Tehran refuses to back down , yesterday urged the United Nations security council to address the nuclear issue .
But in Tehran yesterday at a packed press conference , Mr Ahmadinejad made it clear he had no intention of being dictated to over the nuclear issue .
"" Peaceful nuclear technology is the fruit of the scientific growth of the Iranian nation and its young people , "" he said .
"" We need this technology for our medical , engineering and technical fields and we will continue with it . ""
Iran claims it is only pursuing a civilian nuclear programme , a matter of national pride , and has no ambitions to build a nuclear bomb .
However , Washington , Tel Aviv and London all share a suspicion that Tehran is covertly embarking on a programme to acquire the technology to build the bomb and they are seeking curbs .
Mr Ahmadinejad was asked about the nuclear issue no fewer than seven times yesterday .
He stuck rigidly to formulaic answers about Iran 's nuclear programme , studiously avoiding threats to withdraw from negotiations with Britain , France and Germany .
The two - year - old negotiations are on hold while the European trio try to come up with fresh proposals to put to the Iranians by the end of July or early August .
In his criticism of Israel , Mr Ahmadinejad said : "" In the international field , some people want to impose a one - sided relationship .
The situation of the heads of the Zionist regime [ Israel ] is clearer than to require any explanation from me . ""
Those people who demolish houses over the heads of women and children are the real source of any problems in the Middle East . ""
Asked about his approach to Iran 's much - criticised human rights record , Mr Ahmadinejad replied : "" Liberty is the soul of the Islamic revolution . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad , 49 , a slight figure , appeared bemused by the huge number of journalists facing him .
But he insisted that his election win had been achieved in the face of "" foreign manipulation "" .
He added : "" Iran today has self - confidence , self - reliance and is on the path to development .
It does n't have any great need of the United States . ""
Britain has tried to engage with Iran but Mr Ahmadinejad , in his two years as mayor of Tehran , has repeatedly refused requests from the British ambassador , Richard Dalton , for a meeting - a possible indication of his preference for isolation from , rather than involvement , with the west .
The US defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , said Mr Ahmadinejad was "" no friend of democracy "" and would prove himself unacceptable to Iran 's young people and its women .
There has been no immediate reaction from the White House .
But the state department , which dismissed the election as rigged , said : "" With the conclusion of the elections in Iran , we have seen nothing that dissuades us from our view that Iran is out of step with the rest of the region . ""
Analysts suggested that the election victory may strengthen the hawks in the US administration who want the Europeans to abandon negotiations and join the US and Israel in pushing for the imposition of UN sanctions on Iran .
Mark Gasiorowski , an Iran expert at Louisiana State University , said : "" My guess is that it makes it easier for the [ Bush administration ] to argue that Iran is hardline and wo n't reach a deal on the nukes , though I suspect that the EU 3 [ the European negotiators ] will want to play out the negotiations for several more months to see . """
2005-06-28,"The landslide victory of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the second round of Iran 's presidential elections was largely a response to the populist campaign he had waged .
His campaign emphasised the large gap between rich and poor in the country , the rampant corruption that exists there , and his own humble lifestyle .
His victory was a rejection of the preceding era , under Presidents Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami , when this poverty gap grew wide .
It also represents something of a backlash against the social and cultural liberalisation over the past 15 years , especially the much more relaxed standards of dress for women and widespread public romantic activity and gender mixing .
The gap between Iranians who support and those who oppose this liberalisation largely parallels the rich - poor divide , so it is difficult to say how much the election reflects anger at liberalization and how much at the gap between rich and poor .
My guess is that the election outcome mainly reflects the latter , but the former certainly was important for some .
Ahmadinejad 's victory should not have surprised anyone , given the humiliating defeat of Rafsanjani , his second - round opponent , in the 2000 parliamentary election and the equally dismal performance of Iran 's reformist faction in 2003 and 2004 .
The magnitude of Ahmadinejad 's victory should also not be exaggerated .
Only about 35 % of Iranians supported him in the second round .
The results of the first round show that the Iranian public remains deeply polarised , with 38 % of the electorate supporting conservative candidates ; 40%-45 % supporting reformists , "" holding their noses "" and backing Rafsanjani , or boycotting the election ; and perhaps 10 % enthusiastically supporting Rafsanjani as a centrist .
No concrete evidence of large - scale electoral manipulation has emerged , and I doubt that it will .
Rather , this vote is a good example of how elections can have very bizarre , unrepresentative consequences in societies with weak political institutions .
Proponents of democratisation in the Middle East and elsewhere need to focus less on the importance of elections and more on building strong political parties and institutions and encouraging democratic political culture .
In truth , the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , is the main winner here .
Like Khatami , Ahmadinejad will be very visible but not very powerful in the presidency , which has grown considerably weaker as an institution in the past eight years .
Khamenei 's main political rivals - Rafsanjani and the reformist movement - have been decisively defeated , and he now controls all governmental institutions .
The centralisation of power will be greater than at any time since the heyday of the last shah in the 1970s .
Iranians who strongly oppose Ahmadinejad are now in a state of shock and dismay , but I suspect that very few will be willing to risk a major confrontation with his supporters .
They have maintained a posture of passive , sullen discontent in recent years and are likely to remain this way for the foreseeable future .
So a Velvet Revolution or some other form of political upheaval seems unlikely any time soon .
For one thing , the leaders of Iran 's security forces are jubilant about Ahm adinejad 's victory and will act decisively to stop any challenge to the new order .
Moreover , there is presently no leadership capable of orchestrating a Velvet Revolution .
Iran 's reformist and centrist leaders will need several months to assess the situation and regroup .
With Khamenei rather than Ahmadinejad firmly in control , Iran 's domestic and foreign policies are likely to be less extreme than many have predicted .
Although Ahmadinejad 's core supporters will be energised by the outcome , Khamenei is likely to restrain them out of concern that radical measures will antagonise Ahmadinejad 's opponents and the US and EU countries .
Khamenei 's task will be a difficult one , given the severe polarization and the possibility of foreign interference or regional conflict spilling over into Iran .
My guess is that Ahmadinejad 's victory will have the greatest impact on economic policy and the new government 's treatment of its political opponents .
His campaign emphasised populist economic measures such as redistributive fiscal and monetary policies and a crackdown on corruption .
Ahmadinejad 's political opponents will face increased repression .
And the security forces are likely to make extensive efforts to contain popular demonstrations .
Khamenei is likely to restrain the Ahmadinejad government on social and cultural policy , given how important this is to reformist and centrist Iranians , and especially to young Iranians .
I expect Ahmadinejad 's government will undertake at least token crackdowns on dress - code violations and gender mixing .
However , a reversion to the harsh standards of the 1980s seems unlikely .
Iran 's foreign policy will also probably be less extreme than many observers have predicted .
Khamenei will want to avoid triggering US interference in Iran 's domestic affairs .
He also will want to maintain or expand Iran 's economic relations with EU countries and avoid a US - EU united front against Iran .
Consequently , it seems likely that Iran will try to string out negotiations with the EU over its nuclear development programme .
There is still some possibility that it will reach an agreement .
In addition , Iran and the west have similar approaches towards Iraq , Afghanistan and al - Qaida , at least in the short term , so there is some chance of cooperation on these issues .
Nevertheless , foreign policy will undoubtedly be more hostile toward the west under Ahmadinejad than if Rafsanjani had been elected . ·

2005-07-01,"The White House yesterday ratcheted up tensions with Iran by saying that it was taking seriously claims by Americans who were held hostage in the 1979 Tehran embassy siege that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's president - elect , was one of their captors .
President George Bush said "" many questions "" had been raised by the allegations that Mr Ahmadinejad was one of the leaders of radical students who seized the embassy and held 52 hostages for more than year .
The claims were made yesterday by five former hostages who said the incoming Iranian president had been involved in interrogations during the embassy drama .
"" As soon as I saw his picture in the paper , I knew that was the bastard , "" Colonel Charles Scott , 73 , told the Washington Times . ""
He was one of the top two or three leaders ...
The new president of Iran is a terrorist . ""
The claims were emphatically denied in Tehran by Mr Ahmadinejad 's office and two of the student ringleaders of the siege , both of whom are now reformists opposed to the hardline new president .
Several former hostages also said they did not recognise Mr Ahmadinejad .
The White House press secretary , Scott McClellan , said it was taking the allegations seriously and Mr Bush told reporters : "" I have no information .
But obviously his involvement raises many questions .
"" The US and Iran have been at loggerheads over the country 's refusal to bow to international pressure and abandon its nuclear programme , and last week the state department dismissed the election as rigged .
If the claims are proved , they could impair efforts to get Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions .
"" It 's a huge problem .
It is difficult enough to work with Iran and this will make it even more difficult , "" said Senator Carl Levin , the senior Democrat on the armed services committee .
Col Scott , now retired and living in Jonesboro , Georgia , reiterated his claims to the Associated Press .
"" This is the guy .
There 's no question about it , "" he said .
"" You could make him a blond and shave his whiskers , put him in a zoot suit and I 'd still spot him . ""
Three former hostages , David Roeder , William Daugherty and Don Sharer , who have been exchanging emails with Col Scott since pictures of president - elect appeared on television , also told the news agency that they had no doubt that Mr Ahmadinejad , 49 , was one of their captors .
A fifth former hostage , Kevin Hermening , said he had reached the same conclusion .
Militant students seized the US embassy on November 4 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days in protest at Washington 's refusal to hand over the ousted shah , Muhammad Reza Pahlavi .
The shah , who was backed by the US , had fled Iran earlier that year after he was overthrown by the Islamic revolution .
Eight US soldiers were killed during a disastrous rescue operation when a helicopter and C130 transport plane collided in the desert .
The crisis and the botched rescue are commonly cited as reason for Jimmy Carter 's defeat at the hands of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election .
Mr Ahmadinejad was a founding member of the Office of Strengthening Unity , the student organisation that planned the embassy takeover , but an aide said yesterday that he had initially opposed the occupation .
But Mr Daugherty , who worked for the CIA in Iran and now lives in Savannah , Georgia , said a man he was convinced was
Mr Ahmadinejad was among a group of ringleaders who had escorted a Vatican representative during a visit in the early days of the hostage crisis .
He said it would add to pressure on the state department to stop blocking lawsuits filed by the former hostages seeking $ 33bn ( £ 18bn ) in damages from Iran .
A former embassy guard , Paul Lewis , was one of several former hostages who could not recollect Mr Ahmadinejad .
Abbas Abdi , a ringleader of the siege turned radical reformer who was jailed in 2002 for selling intelligence , said : "" Ahmadinejad was not among those who occupied the American embassy after the revolution . ""
But John Simpson , the BBC 's world affairs editor , said : "" I knew there was something faintly familiar about him ...
Somewhere in the BBC archives is the interview I recorded with him and his colleagues , long after the siege was over . """
2005-07-03,"Iran yesterday claimed that its hardline president - elect , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , was the victim of a smear campaign after fresh accusations that he was involved in the assassination of an exiled Kurdish politician .
At the weekend an Austrian MP , Peter Pilz , said he had "" very convincing "" evidence that Mr Ahmadinejad - a former revolutionary guard - was involved in the murder in 1989 of a leading Iranian opposition politician in Vienna .
Abdul Rahman Ghassemlou was shot dead with two other Kurdish activists .
Ghassemlou was the general secretary of the Party for a Democratic Kurdistan , which Tehran had banned .
According to Mr Pilz , Mr Ahmadinejad travelled to Vienna a week before the murders and delivered the weapons used to the Iranian embassy .
The assassins were never caught .
"" The man stands under urgent suspicion of having been involved in the murder of Ghassemlou , "" Mr Pilz , a Green party MP , told Austria 's Der Standard newspaper on Saturday .
Yesterday , however , the Iranian president - elect 's aides angrily dismissed the latest allegations .
"" The charges are so self - evidently false they are not worthy of response , "" a foreign ministry spokesman , Hamid Reza Asefi , said .
He added : "" We advise the Europeans not to fall into the trap of the Zionist media and to separate their interests from America and the Zionist entity . ""
The claim follows earlier allegations that Mr Ahmadinejad was involved in storming the US embassy in Tehran and holding 52 hostages for 444 days in the aftermath of the 1979 Islamic revolution .
Six former hostages have said they believe Mr Ahmadinejad was among their captors .
He has denied any involvement , and his claim is supported by the original hostage takers .
The Bush administration says it is still examining the claim .
At the weekend , however , Mr Pilz said he had handed over documents concerning the murders to Austria 's interior ministry .
State prosecutors in Austria confirmed that they are now investigating .
The documents were "" very credible "" , Mr Pilz said , adding that those responsible for the murders had taken refuge in the Iranian embassy .
They were allowed to slip out of Austria after pressure from Tehran , the MP added .
Tehran denies the charge . ""
The enemy has created these allegations to mask the high turnout in elections , "" Mr Asefi said .
Mr Ahmadinejad , an ultra - conservative and former member of the Office of Strengthening Unity , the student organisation that planned the embassy takeover , was elected by a landslide majority last month , winning some 62 % of votes cast on a turnout of 60 % .
His candidacy appealed to the poor who viewed him as the candidate who would distribute Iran 's abundant oil wealth more directly to them .
On Saturday Saeed Hajjarian , a top former secret agent and now a senior adviser to outgoing reformist President Mohammed Khatami , denied the allegations being levelled against Mr Ahmadinejad .
Several of Mr Ahmadinejad 's associates have said he was opposed to taking over the US embassy .
Although Mr Hajjarian said Mr Ahmadinejad had not been involved in the hostage taking , he has been at loggerheads with the hardline president - elect .
Mr Hajjarian has alleged that Mr Ahmadinejad was involved in financial wrongdoing while previously serving as governor of Ardabil province in north - western Iran .
The former secret agent 's comments are likely to draw an angry reaction from Mr Ahmadinejad .
No official charges have yet been brought against the president - elect , who governed the province before becoming the mayor of Tehran two years ago .
Muhammad Reza Bahonar , a senior hardliner close to Mr Ahmadinejad , acknowledged this week that the intelligence minister , Ali Yunesi , had opposed Mr Ahmadinejad 's appointment as Tehran mayor because there was a "" dossier "" against him .
He did not explain the nature of the case ."
2005-07-06,"The future of Iran 's nuclear talks with the EU was in doubt yesterday amid reports that the country 's top nuclear negotiator had quit .
Official Iranian news agencies said Hassan Rowhani , the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council , had tendered his resignation to the outgoing reformist president , Mohammed Khatami .
The reports followed speculation that Mr Rowhani had told the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , that he would resign before next month 's inauguration of the newly elected hardline president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Analysts said Mr Rowhani 's departure would almost certainly spell the end of Iran 's talks with the EU , a development that could result in it being brought before the UN security council .
Iran is due to resume delicate negotiations at the end of this month with the European trio of Britain , France and Germany .
The Europeans are trying to persuade the Iranians to permanently end uranium enrichment - now suspended - which the west fears may be used in the building of nuclear weapons .
Iran insists its nuclear programme is peaceful .
The Supreme National Security Council denied Mr Rowhani had quit .
"" It 's a sheer lie , "" a spokesman told Reuters . ""
He has not resigned .
Resigning at this time would be meaningless . ""
"" Rowhani 's resignation would n't help anyone , "" one analyst told the Guardian .
"" If he was resigning in protest at the pressure he is under , it would mean somebody with a tougher position would take his place .
But if there is anyone tougher than Rowhani , it means there is no future for the talks . ""
After a meeting in Paris yesterday , the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , and France 's foreign minister , Philippe Douste - Blazy , said Iran must be prevented from resuming uranium enrichment . ""
The world has to be assured that Iran can not have this capacity , "" Ms Rice said . theguardian.com/iran"
2005-07-12,"Iran 's new president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , is one .
So are Belarus 's Alexander Lukashenko and Hugo Chavez of Venezuela .
These men , we are repeatedly told by CNN , the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times , are "" hardliners "" .
But what exactly is a hardliner - and why are some world leaders hardliners and others not ?
In a dictionary you will find hardline defined as "" definite and unyielding "" .
But if so , why is hardliner used so selectively to describe world leaders ?
As Mahmoud Ahmadinejad celebrated his landslide victory , another election was taking place in Bulgaria .
For the past four years the prime minister , Simeon Saxe - Coburg - Gotha , has presided over a privatisation programme that the Iron Lady herself would have drooled over .
His neo - liberal agenda has left half of Bulgaria 's 8 million people surviving on less than two euros a day .
Yet unlike Ahmadinejad , Lukashenko or Chavez , the Bulgarian premier has not been labelled a hardliner - for his "" definite and unyielding "" policies - but instead is referred to as a reformer and a moderniser .
It 's a similar story across eastern and central Europe .
The Hungarian prime minister , Ferenc Gyurcsany , whose government is following the most aggressively neoliberal policies in the EU , recently announced plans to privatise healthcare .
Hungary has no more money for hospitals - but did find £ 7.7 m to buy air - to - air missiles from the US and £ 34.5 m to "" adapt "" its armed forces to the demands of Nato and EU membership .
To many , a policy of putting guns before health would be considered hardline .
But not the western media , who laud Gyurcsany as a "" centrist reformer "" .
Look further and it is clear ; if you run your country for the benefit of international capital and orientate your foreign policy towards the US , you will be a "" reformer "" , "" moderate "" or "" moderniser "" - regardless of how extreme your polices are .
The rule applies even if you served in an SS unit ( like the neoconservatives ' favourite Islamist , the late Bosnian leader Alija Izetbegovic ) or , like the shah of Iran , had one of the most feared secret police forces in the world .
If , on the other hand , you run your country for the benefit of your people and refuse to pay Danegeld to the most powerful empire the world has seen , you will be called a hardliner .
Ahmadinejad is "" hardline "" , not for the social and religious conservatism he shares with the non-""hardline "" leaders of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait , but for his policy of empowering Iranian working class people and defending his country 's right to develop nuclear power .
Lukashenko is "" hardline "" , not for his authoritarianism , but because he wishes to maintain the last planned , socially owned economy in Europe : an alternative economic agenda that has seen his country climb from 68th to 49th in the UN human development index .
And Hugo Chavez is "" hardline "" , not because he once led a failed military coup , but because he wishes to use his nation 's vast oil wealth to benefit Venezuela and not US oil corporations .
It is for standing up for the interests of their own people that these three men are labelled "" hardliners "" .
For those genuinely concerned with social justice , derailing the US behemoth and creating a world in which people come before profits , the more "" hardliners "" - and the less "" moderates "" and "" reformers "" - that are elected to power , the better . · Neil Clark is a writer and broadcaster specialising in Eastern European and Middle Eastern affairs neilclark6@hotmail.com"
2005-07-12,"Iran 's ultra - conservative president elect said last night that he wants "" fair "" relations with the entire world , but warned western nations not to issue demands to his country , which the US accuses of wanting to build nuclear weapons .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's speech came during an exclusive interview with state - run Iranian television and indicated the new Iranian leader 's apparent determination to not bow to US demands to curtail his country 's nuclear programme .
"" We are urging fair relations with the world , but people are being blocked by some who claim they promote democracy and freedom but act vice versa when they deal with Iranians , "" Mr Ahmadinejad said in an apparent reference to the US .
Mr Ahmadinejad also said that his surprise landslide election win last month was a message from Iranians to "" the world that they want to be independent "" .
"" They [ the west ] still think like landlords of a century ago , "" he said.""Landlords expected their peasants just to listen to their words .
But the period of one - sided decision - making is over .
Our nation does not accept imposed relations . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad , whose election raised fears in Iran and abroad that Iran would take an even tougher line with the west , urged unity among Iranian political groups .
"" All political groups and parties must accompany our nation and domestic and foreign issues should be solved by people power , "" he said .
He provided few details about his political agenda , but said choosing cabinet ministers was his most important task at the moment .
He mentioned no likely candidates .
The former mayor of Tehran replaced Mohammad Khatami , the pro - reformist president of eight years .
Reformists claimed that candidates supporting political , democratic and economic reform in Iran were unfairly barred from taking part in the latest polls ."
2005-08-03,"Iranian blogger Hossein Derakshan has written a fascinating comment on the new president of Iran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , for Guardian Unlimited today .
Here is an extract : Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's win reflects a significant socio - economic gap in Iranian society .
But it would be wrong to view his victory as a sign that people are tired of reform and have given up hope of change toward a transparent democracy .
Mr Ahmadinejad , a moral conservative , does not represent the majority of Iranians , two - thirds of whom are under 30 and many of those liberal in orientation .
Neither does he represent the continuation of Ayatollah Khomeini 's vision for the future of Iran .
Rather , he is someone through whom the supreme leader will , for the first time , try to manage the executive branch of the regime .
Many western journalists , although regretful for having covered Iran with a distorting focus on the educated and well - off middle - class in Tehran , have started to get things wrong again - but in the opposite way .
As Iranians say , they are now falling off the roof from the other side .
They have begun talking about Mr Ahmadinejad as if he were the Muslim reincarnation of Che Guevara .
You can read it in full here and leave your comments below ."
2005-08-03,"Iran 's president - elect , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , took his first step towards assuming office today , receiving religious approval from the supreme leader of Iran .
Mr Ahmadinejad , 48 , a secular conservative and former mayor of Tehran , won elections in June amid allegations of unfair practices , with pledges to work for social justice and the alleviation of poverty .
He will be formally inaugurated on Saturday . ""
The deprived people and the poor people will be the first priority on my agenda , "" Mr Ahmadinejad told a crowd of hundreds of clerics and politicians at today 's ceremony .
Among the audience at the Imam Khomeini Hosseinieh religious complex , in central Tehran , was the outgoing president , Mohammad Khatami , and the man Mr Ahmadinejad defeated in the second - round run - off , the former president Hashemi Rafsanjani .
During the ceremony , Mr Khatami read out a letter in which the supreme leader of Iran , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , appointed Mr Ahmadinejad as president . ""
As a servant of the republic and a drop in the endless ocean of the Iranian nation ... I commit myself to respond to the trust and hopes of such a nation by serving them honestly , "" the new president said in response .
In his acceptance speech , Mr Ahmadinejad went on to speak forcefully against nuclear weapons , alluding to the dispute with Europe and the US over his country 's nuclear programme . ""
Global threats , including weapons of mass destruction - chemical and biological weapons which are in the hands of dominant powers - should be dismantled , "" he said .
Ayatollah Khamenei struck a more defiant tone , suggesting Iran would continue with its nuclear programme despite intense pressure from the west . ""
All powers , and especially the great Satan America , should know that the Iranian people will not pay tribute to any power , "" he said .
Tehran insists the purpose of its nuclear programme is to fuel civilian nuclear power plants , but Washington and an EU troika of France , Germany and Britain fear Iran plans to enrich the uranium , producing weapons - grade material .
They have demanded a permanent end to the programme , which has been suspended since November last year , but following a recent breakdown in negotiations with the EU nations Tehran has said it will resume activity at its Isfahan facility .
Ali Aghamohammadi , a spokesman for Iran 's supreme national security council , said today he hoped the plant would be up and running before the end of the day .
"" They are doing the executive work , and we hope that today we will be able to restart the activities , "" he told reporters .
Iranian officials have repeatedly said the decision to resume nuclear fuel work was irreversible but would be carried out under the supervision of inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
However , the IAEA said it would take at least a week for it to send surveillance equipment from its headquarters in Vienna and install it . ""
One week is not acceptable for Iran for the installation of equipment , "" Mr Aghamohammadi said .
"" Iran is hoping we will be able to resume activities today . ""
The EU nations have warned Iran that any resumption of nuclear fuel activities would mean an end to two years of negotiations and the possible imposition of sanctions by the UN security council .
In addition to the international tensions over his country 's nuclear programme , Mr Ahmadinejad takes office amid questions about his own past .
He is loyal to the values of the Iranian Islamic revolution of 1979 , and Washington claims he played a key role in the storming of the US embassy in Tehran after the overthrow of the US backed ruler , the shah - something he and those who took part deny .
Austrian investigators are looking into whether he was involved in the murder of Kurdish dissidents in Vienna in 1989 .
His aides deny the charges .
The victory of the former Revolutionary Guard sparked concerns among investors when he said he would clean out corruption in the oil industry and give no preferential treatment to foreign firms .
But analysts say investors should wait and see , arguing that Mr Ahmadinejad took a pragmatic line as mayor of Tehran and could well do so again as president of the world 's fourth largest oil producing country ."
2005-08-03,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was sworn in as president of Iran yesterday at a difficult time .
It came as an unpleasant surprise in June when this little - known populist hardliner trounced a candidate from the reformist wing of the country 's byzantine political scene .
Now , just as the former revolutionary guard and mayor of Tehran replaces the pro - reform Mohammad Khatami , comes a potentially fateful moment in the long - running row over Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
The Islamic Republic insists it has the right to nuclear power generation - though it is blessed with vast reserves of oil and gas .
The US and others suspect that its real intention is to secretly develop nuclear weapons .
This explosive issue has been kept under control for two years as Britain , France and Germany , representing the EU , have adopted a carefully calibrated carrot - and - stick approach .
They learned the hard way in Iraq that having no policy allows the US to go it alone , so the Europeans have bent over backwards in the face of suspicion and hostility from Washington to ensure diplomacy works .
Now though , with Iran 's hawks in the ascendant , a crisis is looming .
Appeals by the International Atomic Energy Agency - the UN 's nuclear watchdog - have fallen on deaf ears in Tehran , where the authorities insisted again yesterday that they will unilaterally resume the uranium ore conversion they suspended when talks began last year .
That would pre - empt delivery of a long - awaited package of EU incentives being unveiled this weekend .
The coming days will tell whether this is brinkmanship or an end to negotiations .
The stakes are high - though cool nerves are in order , especially given the dismal state of intelligence about Iraqi WMD .
The latest US estimate is that Iran is a decade away from making a bomb , very different from what may be a self - serving Israeli view that it is already far closer to that goal .
There is obvious danger in the fact that the nuclear issue is coming to a head so soon after Mr Ahmadinejad 's election dashed hopes of advances for reformists and strengthened the baleful influence of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Like other unfree regimes , Iran 's thrives on external pressure .
The new president has already complained that he is the target of a smear campaign linking him to the occupation of the US embassy in Tehran after Ayatollah Khomeini 's 1979 revolution .
Mistrust between the two countries still runs deep .
Yet even moderates argue that Iran is entitled to nuclear power , as indeed it is under the terms of the nuclear non - proliferation treaty .
The problem is that it has been caught red - handed cheating in the past .
The fact that the five "" official "" nuclear powers have not met their own disarmament obligations , and that Israel ( aided by Britain in the 1950s , as we report today ) , as well as India and Pakistan all have weapons outside the treaty does not mean Iran should be allowed to follow suit .
It has to choose between a road that may lead to UN sanctions and isolation , or the international cooperation , trade and investment needed to feed and employ a young and fast - growing population .
If Iran does reject the EU offer , which includes civilian nuclear technology , it will be hard to avoid the conclusion that its true goal is military .
The lesson of Iraq is that engagement with a difficult regime is more likely to encourage change than sanctions and war .
Iran , famously part of George Bush 's "" axis of evil "" , has behaved with constructive restraint over Iraq and Afghanistan .
But its domestic record is lamentable and human rights abuses commonplace .
Shirin Ebadi , the Iranian lawyer and Nobel prize laureate , insisted yesterday that the gradual social , media and legal advances of recent years must not be reversed .
That is a brave and optimistic assertion that will not easily survive a crisis with the west over nuclear weapons ."
2005-08-03,"The EU warned Iran yesterday that it would end two years of negotiations over nuclear projects if Tehran fulfils threats to end its freeze on the enrichment of uranium .
Amid a mood of mounting emergency and showdown between the west and the incoming regime of President - elect Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , new US intelligence sounded a less alarmist note about the potential crisis , despite sabre - rattling from the Bush administration and Israel .
A US intelligence estimate on Iran , ordered last January , concluded that it could be 10 years before Tehran had sufficient material to arm a nuclear warhead , the Washington Post reported .
On Monday Iran notified the UN 's nuclear inspectorate that it was removing the UN seals on equipment for converting raw uranium into gaseous form for enrichment , ending a freeze agreed with the EU last November .
The move came days before the EU is to table detailed incentives to Iran in an attempt to persuade it to scrap uranium enrichment .
The deal was negotiated by Britain , France and Germany for the EU , with the tacit support of Washington .
The EU troika responded to the Iranian move yesterday in a letter to Tehran 's chief nuclear negotiator , implicitly warning they would join the US for the first time in two years of dispute in taking the issue to the UN security council in New York . ""
Were Iran to resume currently suspended activities , our negotiations would be brought to an end and we would have no option but to pursue other courses of action , "" the EU letter said .
While Chancellor Gerhard Schröder called Iran 's manoeuvres "" threatening "" , the French government warned of a looming "" major international crisis "" .
Despite the manoeuvring , operations have not yet started at the uranium conversion plant at Isfahan , 300 miles south of Tehran .
While Iranian officials said the decision to restart activities was "" irreversible "" , a senior official also said Iran would not break the UN seals unilaterally , providing scope for a climbdown . ""
This Iranian affair is very serious , "" said the French foreign minister , Philippe Douste - Blazy .
"" It could be the beginning of a major international crisis . ""
If Iran started processing uranium ore into uranium hexafluoride , the minister said , the EU troika would summon an emergency meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency and push for referral to the UN security council and the prospect of sanctions .
The Americans , in particular , have pushed for referral and sanctions for two years , convinced that Tehran has long had an illicit bomb programme .
While supporting that contention , the new US intelligence takes a more sanguine view , surmising it could be 2015 before Iran can build a bomb , considerably longer than previous estimates .
The two years of negotiations between Iran and the EU trio are on the cusp of collapse because Tehran , in advance , deems the EU offer to be made this weekend as unacceptable .
The sticking point concerns uranium enrichment .
As a signatory to the non - proliferation treaty , Iran is entitled to enrich uranium for a civil programme and insists that the EU acknowledges that right .
The Europeans balk at this .
By contrast , while agreeing Iran may conduct some activities in what is known as the nuclear fuel cycle , they demand that Iran forgo the right to enrich uranium until there are "" objective guarantees "" the programme is peaceful .
Effectively that means making the freeze permanent .
Iran , in what it views as a national project , has spent more than 20 years , mostly in secret , developing a sophisticated enrichment programme and is unlikely to mothball it permanently .
In an interview with the AP news agency , Hans Blix , the former UN chief weapons inspector said yesterday that the best way to make Iran cease was for the US to guarantee it would not seek regime change . ·
An Iranian judge who sentenced several reformist dissidents to jail , including hunger - striking reporter Akbar Ganji , was shot dead by a lone gunman riding a motorcycle , a spokesman said yesterday .
"" Hassan Moghaddas was shot and martyred after leaving the court building , "" Jamal Karimirad told Reuters ."
2005-08-14,"Iran 's new president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , yesterday signalled a sharp move towards ultra - Islamist policies and a readiness to confront the west by naming a hardline cabinet .
In a marked departure from the moderate liberal approach of his reformist predecessor , Mohammed Khatami , his 21 nominees included staunch conservatives for the key foreign , interior , intelligence and culture ministries .
With his choice of foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , a conservative MP and former ambassador to Japan and Turkey , Mr Ahmadinejad - who took office last week after being elected in an unexpected landslide in June - indicated an intention to harden Iran 's stance over its nuclear programme .
The appointment sent a defiant message to the US president , George Bush , who warned last Friday that military force "" remained on the table "" to compel Iran to comply with international demands that it cease uranium conversion , a process the US and Europe believe is intended to lead to the development of a nuclear bomb .
Yesterday the warning drew threats of an Iranian counter - attack .
"" Bush should know that our capabilities are much greater than those of the United States , "" said Hamid Reza Asefi , a foreign ministry spokesman .
"" We do n't think that the United States will make such a mistake . ""
Mr Asefi said halting uranium conversion was "" not negotiable "" .
However , he said no decision had been reached on whether to progress to uranium enrichment , a process which produces fuel for nuclear reactors but can also be the core of an atomic bomb .
Iranian scientists resumed uranium conversion last week at a plant near Isfahan after it was suspended for several months pending negotiations with Europe .
At an emergency meeting in Vienna , the International Atomic Energy Authority , the UN 's nuclear watchdog , averted an immediate crisis with a resolution calling on Iran to halt the process .
Failure to comply could see Iran being called before the UN security council .
IAEA inspectors have been ordered to prepare a report on Iran 's response by September 3 .
Mr Ahmadinejad has tempered his government 's uncompromising rhetoric with assurances that he is prepared to continue negotiations .
However , in another move , the new president yesterday named a close ally and finance supremo , Ali Saeedlou , as oil minister at a time when Iran is reaping hefty revenues from record oil prices .
Senior Iranian figures have raised the possibility of using rising oil prices as a bargaining chip to force concessions on the nuclear issue ."
2005-08-17,"Dawn has barely broken on the fledgling presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , but Iran 's new leader is already showing ominous signs of realising the worst fears of his liberal - minded opponents .
The ultra - Islamist former mayor of Tehran , who was elected president in an unforeseen electoral landslide in June , offered his first serious indication of intent when he announced the make - up of his cabinet on Sunday .
If the nation 's downcast political reform movement had been hoping he would use the occasion to reach out to it across the yawning political divide , it was badly disappointed .
Far from revealing an inclusive "" big tent "" cabinet , Mr Ahmadinejad named a team of unreconstructed religious conservatives after his own heart .
It was yet another body blow to reformers , who were badly in need of encouragement after an election defeat that compounded years of setbacks .
During that time , the former president Mohammed Khatami 's liberal - leaning administration was repeatedly blocked in its attempts to bring lasting change .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's 21-strong all - male cabinet ( the Islamic Republic has never had a female cabinet minister ) presents a tellingly hirsute spectacle .
With the sole exception of the economics minister , Davoud Danesh - Jafari , all the new ministers sport a fecund display of facial hair in the best Islamist tradition .
But it is Mr Ahmadinejad 's choices for some key portfolios that has set reformist nerves on edge .
Many observers see the intelligence , interior and culture ministries as the acid test of his seriousness about delivering on his post - election pledge of a "" government of moderation "" .
If that is the case , the signs are not promising .
For all three , Mr Ahmadinejad has chosen noted hardliners whose track records indicate little inclination towards tolerating dissent or social freedom .
His choice of interior minister , Mustafa Pour - Mohammadi , is a case in point .
The interior ministry was previously seen as a bastion of reformism but , under Mr Pour - Mohammadi , that could change drastically .
With a background as a revolutionary and military prosecutor in the early years of the regime , the new man is likely to have little truck with reformist notions .
Most worryingly , he was the deputy intelligence minister in the late 90s , when his immediate superior was forced to resign after being implicated in the serial murders of several political dissidents .
When his boss quit , Mr Pour - Mohammadi resigned as well .
A similarly bleak tale can be read into Mr Ahmadinejad 's choice of minister for culture and Islamic guidance , in charge of deciding the level of artistic and press freedom in Iran .
Mohammad Hossein Saffar -
Harandi - like Mr Ahmadinejad , a former revolutionary guard commander - threatens to be a bath of ice - cold water in comparison with the relative cultural warmth of Mr Khatami 's presidency .
Until recently , he was editor in chief of the Kayhan newspaper , where he upheld a staunchly hardline editorial policy that reflected his likely approach to his new job .
Ghollamhossein Mohseni - Ejeie , the new intelligence minister , served as the judiciary 's representative to the intelligence ministry in the early 90s , recalled by many Iranians as a period of political repression and tight religious control .
With fears rising of a new era of authoritarianism , leading figures elsewhere on the political spectrum are being spurred into action .
Seeing the need for some sort of concerted opposition , Mr Khatami has begun talks with his predecessor as president , Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani - defeated by Mr Ahmadinejad in June 's election - apparently with the aim of forming a coherent team of former ministers who can criticise the new government .
The two former presidents have expressed concern over what they see as the exclusion of competent and experienced figures from the new administration .
Ordinary people have more mundane worries .
In the febrile atmosphere of uncertainty accompanying the Ahmadinejad government 's early days , rumours of social crackdowns abound .
The latest is that the new government is to ban travel agents from offering organised tours to the Turkish resort of Antalya , popular with secular middle - class Iranians , on religious grounds .
It may be untrue , but the fears are a reflection of the signals Mr Ahmadinejad is sending with his choice of ministers , whose appointments have still to be confirmed by the majlis , Iran 's parliament .
On the face of things , similar uncompromising messages are being emitted on the standoff with Europe and the US over Iran 's nuclear programme .
The new foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , and Ali Larijani , the new secretary of the supreme national security council , are hardline advocates of Iran 's nuclear rights who have criticised the Iranian negotiators for being too soft in their talks with the EU .
However , things may be less clear than they appear on this issue .
Conventional wisdom had it that the resignation of Mr Larijani 's predecessor , Hasan Rowhani , would spell the end of negotiations with the EU trio of Britain , Germany and France .
Now he has been put in charge of these talks , however
, Mr Larijani has adopted a more reasonable tone .
"" Iran deems it a principle to continue talks , and it accepts negotiation as the right manner , "" he told the Sharq newspaper this week .
"" We can reach a conclusion with a win - win situation defined for both sides . ""
It may be a smokescreen , of course , designed to split the EU from the US after George Bush 's warning last week that military force remains an option for dealing with the Iran situation .
Or it may be a sign that Iran 's Islamist new president is capable of surprising the world ."
2005-08-24,"Iran 's new president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , suffered his first political setback last night when the conservative - dominated parliament rejected four of his proposed cabinet ministers , including the nominee for the strategically vital oil portfolio .
After four days of intense debate , MPs resoundingly rebuffed Mr Ahmadinejad 's choice of Ali Saeedlou as oil minister following fierce criticism that he was unqualified for the post .
Mr Saeedlou , who served as finance supremo to Mr Ahmadinejad while the latter was mayor of Tehran , has no previous experience in the oil industry .
The president 's choices for the higher education , social welfare and cooperative ministries also failed to win confirmation .
Mr Ahmadinejad has three months in which to come up with replacement nominees .
"" Parliament had expected more important and better candidates to be assigned for these posts , "" the parliament 's speaker , Gholamali Haddadadel , said after the vote .
Mr Saeedlou 's rejection is the most serious blow to Mr Ahmadinejad , who has promised to redistribute Iran 's vast oil wealth to alleviate widespread poverty .
The vote signalled that Mr Ahmadinejad 's presidency may have a rougher ride than expected from parliament , even though most of its 290 members are conservatives who are broadly sympathetic to his hardline Islamist views .
Signs of dissent emerged when Mr Ahmadinejad formally presented his 21 nominees and programme for government on Sunday .
One conservative MP , Emad Afugh , said Mr Ahmadinejad 's policies amounted to little more than "" beautiful words "" and accused him of failing to pick the best potential ministers at his disposal .
Nevertheless , hardliners were approved for the foreign , intelligence , interior and culture ministeries , freeing Mr Ahmadinejad to pursue ideological policies in key areas .
The new interior minister , Mostafa Pourmohammadi - who will play a central role in deciding how to tackle political dissent - also came under fire during the nomination process because of his former role as deputy intelligence minister during the 1990s , when Iran 's intelligence ministry was implicated in the serial murders of political dissidents .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , is a fierce advocate of Iran 's nuclear programme who has criticised the country 's negotiators for making concessions in talks with the EU trio of Britain , France and Germany .
His approval came as Mr Ahmadinejad announced he was ready to offer new proposals in the talks , which stalled after Iran resumed uranium conversion work at its plant in Isfahan earlier this month .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's promise of a fresh initiative came after the International Atomic Energy Agency , the UN 's nuclear watchdog , announced that tests appeared to vindicate Iran 's claims that traces of highly enriched uranium found in nuclear facilities two years ago were from imported equipment .
The US yesterday dismissed the findings as meaningless"
2005-09-15,"The leaders of Britain , France and Germany are meeting the new Iranian president today in an attempt to avoid referring Iran to the UN security council over its nuclear activities .
Iran 's hardline president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , meets the leaders to discuss ways of avoiding possible sanctions after Iran resumed its uranium enrichment programme last month .
The meeting is part of the three - day UN summit being held in New York .
A key aim of the summit is to take action to achieve the UN Millennium Development Goals , a set of eight targets intended to reduce global poverty and disease by 2015 .
The UN meeting will also decide ways in which to reform the institution , but several member states - most notably the US - have opposed many of the sweeping changes proposed and instead insisted on a "" watered - down "" version of the body 's final declaration .
George Bush , the US president , has held a series of one - to - one meetings with other world leaders to try to diplomatically isolate Iran over its nuclear activities .
Mr Ahmadinejad is also holding talks with other leaders in an effort to win support for Iran 's programme .
Analysts say the Iranian nuclear programme is the most important issue being discussed alongside the official aims of the summit .
Today 's talks come ahead of a meeting of International Atomic Energy Agency - the UN 's nuclear watchdog - on Monday .
The meeting will decide whether to refer Iran to the security council for possible sanctions .
Yesterday , the French prime minister , Dominique De Villepin , threatened Iran with referral to the security council . ""
In the nuclear sphere , we have put our trust in the IAEA where there are rights to uphold and duties to enforce , "" he told a security council meeting .
"" If a state fails in its obligations under the [ nuclear ] non - proliferation treaty , it is legitimate , once dialogue has been exhausted , to refer it to the security council . ""
However , Mr Ahmadinejad insists Iran has a right to resume its nuclear programme , and reportedly said before leaving for the summit : "" All nations should be allowed to use different kinds of energies , including nuclear . ""
He is due to address the summit this afternoon - his first major international appearance since being elected in June .
Tehran suspended its nuclear programme in November 2004 and began talks with Britain , France and Germany aimed on using imported low - enriched nuclear fuel for its reactors instead .
However , work last month restarted at the processing plant in Isfahan , south of Tehran , prompting a flurry of proposals from the troika designed to halt Iran 's enrichment activities .
Tehran has always maintained that it wants to enrich uranium for use as fuel in its nuclear power plants .
However , the Europeans and Washington suspect it of wanting to continue the enrichment process in an effort to produce a nuclear bomb .
At the opening assembly of the summit yesterday , the UN secretary general , Kofi Annan , criticised states that had blocked plans for reform and said they had allowed "" posturing to get in the way of results "" ."
2005-09-18,"Iran last night invited private firms to join its nuclear programme , further escalating tensions with the West .
The country 's hardline president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , told the United Nations general assembly in New York that Tehran held the ' inalienable right ' to develop a nuclear capability fuel cycle .
His invitation to companies to share its nuclear secrets will prove antagonistic to the US , which earlier yesterday had issued a warning that Iran 's atomic ambitions threatened world peace .
Ahmadinejad , who was elected in June , claimed that the involvement of the private sector in its nuclear enrichment programme would prove that Tehran is not producing nuclear weapons .
Hours earlier , US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice had warned Iran to abandon ' forever ' its nuclear weapons ambitions .
But Ahmadinejad rejected accusations that the regime was seeking to build nuclear weapons , claiming that its ' religious principles ' prevent it from so doing .
He also called for a UN committee to be set up to investigate which countries had given Israel the technology to develop nuclear weapons .
Last night 's speech in New York by Ahmadinejad follows US - led attempts to gather support for Iran to be referred to the UN security council and face possible sanctions if it did not halt is nuclear ambitions .
Tomorrow , the International Atomic Energy Agency will vote on the action it will take over Iran .
The debate over nuclear weapons took a further twist last week when senior diplomats told The Observer that the failure of last week 's UN summit to deliver an agreement on the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons was jeopardised by the US .
Officials involved in the negotiations have confirmed that the Bush administration 's refusal to countenance any form of disarmament blocked efforts to push measures that would prevent regimes seeking to develop a nuclear capability .
The news contradicts some reports that the US had been furious that plans to crack down on nuclear proliferation were stripped out of the final UN document .
Iran last month spurned a European package of economic , security and technology incentives for it to abandon sensitive nuclear work and reactivated a factory converting uranium ore into gas ."
2005-09-18,"European countries will today launch an effort to punish Iran for its perceived recalcitrance over its nuclear programmes after the country 's hardline president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , said there was no chance of Tehran forfeiting its entitlement to enrich uranium .
In a defiant and shrewd move at the weekend , Mr Ahmadinejad told a summit of world leaders in New York that Iran would not give up nuclear fuel manufacturing , but he added that it would go well beyond the standard practices of having the UN inspectors monitor the programme by opening up the uranium enrichment operations to foreign companies and countries .
The British foreign secretary , Jack Straw , yesterday described the Iranian move as "" unhelpful and disappointing "" and EU officials made plain they would press ahead with the attempt to have Iran reported to the security council .
The US state department said that there would be a meeting today between senior US officials and France , Britain and Germany on how to move forward after Mr Ahmadinejad 's speech .
British officials are drafting a resolution to be put to a crucial meeting of the 35-strong International Atomic Energy Agency board in Vienna today , but there is no chance of the formula enjoying unanimous support .
The Americans and the Europeans are said to have decided to push for an unprecedented vote on the resolution .
That might produce the 18 votes needed to send Iran to the UN security council but would be very divisive .
If Iran were reported to the security council it could be reprimanded , ordered to mend its ways and , eventually , have sanctions imposed .
The long - running dispute is now utterly deadlocked , with Iran categorically refusing to abandon its nuclear fuel cycle and the Europeans and Americans unwilling to settle for anything less .
The nub of the crisis is Iran 's determination to develop its own uranium enrichment programme , which it insists is for civil nuclear purposes .
The west agrees to Iran having a civil nuclear programme but says it should not be allowed to make nuclear fuel or enrich uranium .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's weekend statement definitively ruling out Iran giving up nuclear fuel manufacture means two years of talks with Britain , Germany , and France have failed .
Mr Ahmadinejad used his speech to indirectly attack the US , saying "" state terrorism is being supported by those who claim to fight terrorism "" .
He added Iran had an "" inalienable right "" to peaceful nuclear technology .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's offer of international involvement in Iran 's uranium enrichment industry presents a challenge to the west .
The world leader in uranium enrichment is the British - Dutch - German consortium Urenco , which could be engaged in Iran if the Ahmadinejad offer was accepted , meaning that the European experts would be able to police the Iranian project , verify its civilian character and monitor any possible diversion of material for military purposes .
The Iranians say that would prove their peaceful intent .
The Europeans and Americans reject the offer because perfecting uranium enrichment would give the Iranians the wherewithal and know - how for producing weapons - grade uranium ."
2005-10-26,"A committee of Islamic clerics in Iran , led by the country 's new hardline president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , this week banned foreign films in an effort to wipe out what they called "" corrupt Western culture "" .
Elements that were specifically named as affronts to the government 's vision of Iran 's Muslim culture included alcohol and drugs , secularists , liberals , anarchists and feminists .
The ban , which follows Mr Ahmadinejad 's campaign promise to promote Islamic culture and confront what he called a cultural invasion by the west , aims to distance the state from the open cultural policies undertaken by former reformist president Mohammad Khatami that encouraged cultural coexistence and dialogue among civilisations .
Many experts and officials say the ban will only cause Iranians to turn to the black market for western videotapes or to foreign satellite television broadcasts .
It is understood that the ban will have little effect on cinemas where few Western films play anyway , but it could dramatically change television , where all channels are controlled by the state and overseen by religious hardliners .
State - run television has hitherto shown foreign films after censoring many scenes deemed immoral or offensive .
Films considered hostile to the Islamic values preached by the ruling establishment are already banned altogether . ""
This new ban appears to be part of a campaign to push Iran back to the 1980s and to impose the same restrictions that were only just eased under Khatami .
But it will be impossible to take Iran back to the 80s again , "" said international relations professor Davoud Hermidas Bavand .
Under President Khatami , Iran 's 70 million citizens , more than half of whom are under 30 , enjoyed growing social and political freedoms and were exposed to western popular culture through satellite television .
The dishes are officially banned but tolerated by authorities .
Many residents in Tehran hide them under tarpaulins or disguise them as air - conditioning units .
Western music , films and clothing are widely available in Iran , and hip - hop tunes can be heard on Tehran 's streets , blaring from car speakers and music shops .
Bootleg videos and DVDs of films banned by the state are widely available on the black market .
Already , the state - run television station in the holy city of Mashhad in north - eastern Iran has reported that police closed several video clubs last week on grounds that they were offering films inconsistent with Islamic culture ."
2005-10-26,"Iran 's new president created a sense of outrage in the west yesterday by describing Israel as a "" disgraceful blot "" that should be "" wiped off the face of the earth "" .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who is more hardline than his predecessor , told students in Tehran that a new wave of Palestinian attacks would be enough to finish off Israel .
The populist leader 's comments [ See footnote ] , reported by the state - run media , come at a time when Tehran is under pressure over its suspect nuclear weapons ambitions and alleged involvement in attacks on British troops in Iraq .
He said : "" Anybody who recognises Israel will burn in the fire of the Islamic nation 's fury , [ while ] any [ Islamic leader ] who recognises the Zionist regime means he is acknowledging the surrender and defeat of the Islamic world . ""
He was addressing a conference titled The World Without Zionism .
His speech was immediately condemned by the US , Britain , France , Germany and Israel .
The Foreign Office could not recall a similar statement from a senior Iranian leader since the former president Hashemi Rafsanjani five years ago called for a Muslim state to annihilate Israel with a nuclear strike .
Since then , there has been a mild thaw in relations between Muslim states , including Arab ones , and Israel .
But Mr Ahmadinejad rejected compromise : "" There is no doubt that the new wave [ of attacks ] in Palestine will wipe off this stigma [ Israel ] from the face of the Islamic world . ""
Recalling the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , leader of Iran 's Islamic revolution , he said : "" As the imam said , Israel must be wiped off the map . ""
The US and Britain are leading a push to have Iran referred to the UN security council next month because of fears that it is covertly engaged in securing a nuclear weapons capability by deciding to restart a uranium conversion programme , an early step towards such an ability .
Tehran has repeatedly said its programme is for civil use only .
Both the US and Britain saw their fears about Mr Ahmadinejad 's election confirmed when he made a fiery speech at a UN summit in New York in September .
His predecessor , Muhammad Khatami , had tried to improve links with the west and been less vocal in condemnation of Israel .
The US said the president 's remarks proved the accuracy of Washington 's fears .
"" I think it reconfirms what we have been saying about the regime .
It underscores the concerns we have about Iran 's nuclear intentions , "" Scott McClellan , the White House press secretary , said .
Mark Regev , an Israeli foreign ministry spokesman , said : "" Unfortunately this is not the first time that we 've heard such an extremist message from the Iranian leadership .
I think there is a growing understanding in the international community that the regime is not Israel 's problem alone , but a problem the entire international community must grapple with . ""
Israel views Iran as its main security threat in the Middle East .
The defence minister , Shaul Mofaz , has said Tehran could be capable of developing a nuclear weapon within months and that there is a need for urgent action to prevent that .
Israel has issued thinly veiled threats against Iran 's nuclear programme if diplomatic efforts fail and is buying 500 "" bunker - buster "" bombs from the US that could be used to destroy the facilities .
The Israeli foreign minister , Silvan Shalom , raised the question of the nuclear programme with the visiting Russian foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , in Jerusalem yesterday .
Russia is selling nuclear fuel for the reactors to Iran , despite Israel 's objections .
France and Germany expressed concern about Mr Ahmadinejad 's remarks yesterday .
Jean - Baptiste Mattei , a French foreign ministry spokesman , said : "" We have noted press articles reporting the comments of President Ahmadinejad .
If these comments were indeed made , we condemn them with the utmost firmness . ""
A German foreign ministry spokesman , Walter Lindner , said : "" Should these comments have actually been made , they are completely unacceptable and to be condemned in the sharpest terms . ""

2005-10-27,"The appalling comments on Israel made by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ( Israel should be wiped off map , October 27 ) are both empty rhetoric and highly damaging to the Palestinian cause .
I believe we ( Palestinian Muslims and Christians ) should always make a clear distinction between our political struggle against institutionalised racism and ethnic cleaning in Palestine - Israel and the fact that we and the Israelis would , ultimately , have to live together as equal citizens under some form of secular democracy - and not wipe each other out .
Muslim fundamentalists ( Ahmadinejad included ) have miserably failed to understand the reality in historic Palestine : in the process of brutal colonisation of the country , a Hebrew - speaking "" nation "" has emerged , with its own distinct language , culture and flourishing literature .
There are 5 - 6 million Hebrew - speaking Israelis and no one has the right to talk about wiping them out .
Acknowledging the current bi - national reality is something completely different from legitimising the colonial process by which this reality has come about .
The fact that the Israelis are trying quietly , but systematically ( although not always successfully ) , on the ground to do to Palestinians in the West Bank what Ahmadinejad seems to suggest should be done to Israel should only encourage us to seek an alternative vision , away from political Zionism and Islamic fundamentalism .
Dr Nur Masalha University of Surrey
The president of a highly influential Muslim state has effectively called for the next Jewish Holocaust , and has called for it to be a Muslim - sponsored one - not in the sense of eliminating every single Jew , but in the sense of destroying a place that is the only sacred land for many Jews , as sacred as are Mecca or Medina to Muslims .
Europe hosts many Muslim organisations which claim they adopt moderate political stances .
They now have a chance to show it by publicly condemning that statement .
Few situations would so clearly illustrate the maxim that silence is complicity .
Many moderate Muslim organisations rightly advocate compromise solutions on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , but there can be no compromise on the question of whether Israel should be utterly destroyed .
Either it should or it should n't .
If it should n't , then Muslim organisations must now say so in the clearest terms , and must strongly condemn Ahmadinejad 's statement .

2005-10-27,"Italy yesterday joined the US , France , Germany and Britain in condemning a speech by the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , calling for Israel to be wiped off the face of the earth , writes diplomatic editor Ewen MacAskill .
The Foreign Office summoned the Iranian charge d'affaires in London to make a formal protest .
The destruction of Israel has been Iranian policy since the revolution in 1979 .
So why a diplomatic spat now ?
One reason is that the US and Britain , along with France and Germany , are pressing to prevent Iran securing a nuclear weapons capability .
Iran repeatedly denies it is trying to secure such a capability , but remarks such as yesterday 's play into the west 's hands .
In western capitals yesterday , the mood was : "" Look what we have to deal with . ""
One western diplomat questioned how else Iran intended wiping Israel off the face of the earth other than by the use of nuclear weapons , even though Mr Ahmadinejad predicted in his speech that a new wave of Palestinian attacks would be sufficient .
The message from the west was that Iran could not be trusted with a nuclear weapon .
The issue of Iran 's nuclear programme , which it claims is purely for civilian purposes , is due to come up again next month at the next meeting of the Interational Atomic Energy Agency , the UN anti - proliferation organisation .
The US and Britain are pushing for Iran to be referred , and Mr Ahmadinejad 's comments do not help Iran 's case .
Mr Ahmadinejad , who became president this summer , is seen in western capitals as naive .
His predecessor , Muhammed Khatami , was generally careful to avoid such inflammatory language , whatever he thought in private .
The speech was also out of kilter with what is happening elsewhere in the Middle East .
Whereas such denunciations of Israel and calls for its destruction were once commonplace , many Arab and Muslim countries have changed .
Israel has improved ties with a range of countries , from the Gulf states to North Africa , and , more recently , Pakistan .
Once regarded as beyond the pale in the Middle East , a string of delegations from formerly hostile countries paraded in to meet the Israeli delegation at a UN summit in New York last month .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's comments may have gone down well with his student audience in Tehran but there is no tolerance for such views in most of the rest of the world ."
2005-10-27,"European governments today piled further condemnation on the Iranian president for his call yesterday for Israel to be "" wiped off the map "" .
But the EU stopped short of backing Israel 's call for Iran to be suspended from the UN over the remarks by its president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Britain has summoned a senior Iranian diplomat to the Foreign Office today to protest at the "" sickening "" comments made in a speech to students in Tehran by Mr Ahmadinejad .
Spain , France , and Canada have also summoned Iranian diplomats to complain about the remarks .
Italy said it had told the Iranian ambassador in Rome the statements were "" unacceptable "" .
Officials from Britain , the US and Italy all said the comments compounded concerns over Iran 's suspected nuclear weapons ambitions .
The official spokesman for the prime minister , Tony Blair , said he would not be surprised if the issue was discussed at an informal summit of EU leaders today at Hampton Court , near London .
"" We condemn in the strongest terms the president 's comments , "" he told reporters .
"" We believe that the solution to the Arab - Israeli dispute is the principle of two states living side by side in peace and security . "" Iran is currently under pressure over its nuclear programme - which it insists is for exclusively civil use - and British allegations that it is helping to train insurgents in Iraq to make bombs that are being used against British troops .
Mr Ahmadinejad , a conservative and populist former mayor of Tehran who was elected president in August this year , told 3,000 students that a new wave of Palestinian attacks "" will wipe this stigma [ Israel ] from the face of the Islamic world "" .
His remarks echoed the rhetoric of the founder of Iran 's Islamic revolution , the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini .
Khomeini repeatedly called for the destruction of Israel but Mr Ahmadinejad 's predecessor as president , Mohammad Khatami , was more moderate and there has recently been a mild thaw in relations between Israel and Muslim states .
Yesterday 's comments from Mr Ahmadinejad were the most extreme since the former president Hashemi Rafsanjani called for a Muslim state to annihilate Israel with a nuclear strike .
Israel 's deputy prime minister , Shimon Peres , called for Iran to be expelled from the UN , although Israel has not yet officially made such a request .
Mr Peres told Israel Radio he did not know whether a call for the removal of Iran from the UN "" has a chance , but this has to be said by us "" .
He said : "" Since the United Nations was established , in 1945 , there has never been a head of state that is a UN member state that publicly called for the elimination of another UN member state .
There has never been such a scandal , it is impossible to ignore this and close your ears . ""
The European Commission president , Jose Manuel Barroso , was asked in an interview this morning if he believed Iran should be expelled from the UN .
He said : "" I condemn absolutely that statement [ Ahmadinejad 's ] but I will not make any concrete proposal now . ""
Mr Barroso told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme : "" It is a completely unacceptable statement , of course .
We should respect borders and respect the integrity of Israel , and we want Israel to live in peace with its neighbours .
"" Russia also rejected the demand for Iran to be ejected from the UN .
The UK Foreign Office called Mr Ahmadinejad 's comments "" deeply disturbing and sickening "" and said Iran 's chargé d'affaires would be summoned .
A Foreign Office spokesman said yesterday 's suicide bombing in a busy coastal market in Hedara in Israel yesterday , which killed five people , had shown "" the horrible reality of the violence he is praising "" .
Israel and the US accuse Iran of developing nuclear weapons and want the security council to consider sanctions against the Tehran government .
Iran says its nuclear programme is peaceful .
The Bush administration said the comments laid bare the "" true views and intentions "" of Iran 's government and "" underscored "" concerns over nuclear weapons .
Israel has issued thinly veiled threats concerning Iran 's nuclear programme , which it has said could lead to the creation of a nuclear weapon within months .
Israel is buying some 500 "" bunker - buster "" bombs from the US .
Israel 's deputy ambassador to the UK , Zvi Rav - Ner , told the Today programme Iran was becoming a "" real source of instability for the peace of the world "" .
He said : "" This [ statement from Iran 's president ] is a clear contravention and breach of the UN charter and it should be dealt with by the international community . """
2005-10-28,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , refused today to retract his call for Israel to be wiped off the map , while the Iranian embassy in Moscow attempted to calm the growing diplomatic crisis .
Mr Ahmadinejad appeared at an anti - Israeli rally attended by thousands of Iranians in Tehran and rejected the international condemnation of his comments as "" invalid "" .
"" My words were the Iranian nation 's words .
Westerners are free to comment , but their reactions are invalid , "" he said .
The Iranian embassy in Moscow earlier attempted to pull back from his declaration after the UN secretary general , Kofi Annan , became the latest world leader to rebuke him .
A statement released by the embassy said Mr Ahmadinejad "" did not have any intention to speak up in such sharp terms and enter into a conflict "" .
But the remarks were unlikely to satisfy Israel , which called today for an emergency session of the UN security council .
"" We have decided to open a broad diplomatic offensive , "" the Israeli foreign minister , Silvan Shalom , said .
The country 's prime minister , Ariel Sharon , called yesterday for Iran to be expelled from the UN . ""
A country that calls for the destruction of another people can not be a member of the UN , "" he said .
Protestors in Tehran and other Iranian cities burned Israeli flags today and held banners displaying anti - Israeli slogans including "" Death to Israel , Death to America "" .
Demonstrations were held across the country to mark the last Friday of the month of Ramadan .
Mr Ahmedinejad 's comments , made on Wednesday , have been widely condemned by world leaders including Tony Blair , who called them "" completely and totally unacceptable "" .
Speaking after the one - day EU summit at Hampton Court , in Surrey , Mr Blair warned that the world would demand direct action against Tehran if the threats were repeated .
"" When we hear such statements made about Israel , it makes us feel very angry .
It 's just completely wrong , "" Mr Blair said .
Mr Annan is due to visit Iran over the next few weeks to discuss other issues , including Tehran 's nuclear programme .
However , the secretary general now says he will place the Middle East peace process and the "" right of all states in that area to live in peace , within secure and recognised boundaries , free from threats or acts of force "" at the top of his agenda .
In an unusual display of public condemnation , Mr Annan expressed his "" dismay "" yesterday at Mr Ahmadinejad 's remarks and warned Tehran that all UN members had agreed to "" refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity ... of any state "" .
The US , Canadian , Russian and European leaders have all criticised Mr Ahmadinejad 's remarks , though none backed Mr Sharon 's demand that Iran should be thrown out of the UN .
Several countries , including Britain , France , Russia , Spain , Germany and the Netherlands have also rebuked Iranian diplomats ."
2005-10-28,"Israel is to seek an emergency meeting of the UN security council in the wake of a remark by Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , that Israel should be "" wiped off the map "" .
"" We have decided to open a broad diplomatic offensive , "" Silvan Shalom , Israel 's foreign minister , told Israel radio yesterday .
"" We have decided to turn to the security council for an emergency session .
I have called on all my counterparts through the world not to turn a blind eye and to stop once and for all the Iranian games . ""
He said it would "" be a nightmare if one day we wake up and discover that Iran has nuclear weapons "" .
Following international condemnation yesterday Mr Ahmadinejad stood by his remark .
"" My words were the Iranian nation 's words .
Westerners are free to comment but their reactions are invalid , "" he told the official Irna news agency .
The sharp international response to the president 's views surprised Israel , which had initially condemned his words but also saw them as a reflection of Iranian policy over the past 25 years .
But the uproar has given Israel an opportunity to press its case that Iran is a dangerous country that can not be allowed to obtain nuclear weapons .
It is also taking advantage of the confrontation to highlight links between Tehran and armed Palestinian groups . ""
The sad fact about the statement of the president of Iran is that he was correctly articulating the policy of his regime which has given hands - on support to the most extreme terrorist elements in the Middle East , "" said Mark Regev , the Israeli foreign ministry spokesman .
The Palestinian chief negotiator , Saeb Erekat , joined the condemnation yesterday .
"" I urge the president of Iran to focus on adding Palestine to the map alongside Israel , not calling for wiping a country from the map , "" he said .
"" All those who want to support the Palestinian cause must support a two - state solution with Palestine alongside Israel . ""
Although Mr Ahmadinejad showed no sign of backtracking yesterday , a former president , Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , made conciliatory remarks suggesting a referendum be held for Israelis and Palestinians to decide on their future .
"" If Muslims and Palestinians agree [ to a referendum ] , it will be a retreat , but let 's still hold a referendum , "" he said in his sermon at Friday prayers .
Iran 's embassy in Moscow , which in the past has been used to make statements on foreign policy , tried to placate critics with a statement saying the president "" did not have any intention to speak up in sharp terms and enter into a conflict "" .
This was the first official Iranian comment since the diplomatic storm broke.""It 's absolutely clear that , in his remarks , Mr Ahmadinejad ... underlined the key position of Iran , based on the necessity to hold free elections on the occupied territories , "" the embassy 's statement said .
Russia and China , which relies heavily on Iranian oil , would probably block a security council vote against Iran , though Sergei Lavrov , Russia 's foreign minister , has warned that the president 's remarks could provide ammunition for those who want the security council to act against Iran .
Yesterday at least 100,000 people took part in al - Quds day protests in Iran , while similar rallies were held in other parts of the Middle East .
Following the Iranian revolution in 1979 , Ayatollah Khomeini declared the last Friday in the Muslim holy month of Ramadan as al - Quds day - a day of protest for the liberation of Jerusalem ."
2005-10-28,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's greenhorn president , sent a shiver of alarm across Europe and the Middle East with his demand that Israel be "" wiped off the face of the Earth "" .
But even if the remark was more than mere rhetoric , Mr Ahmadinejad 's ability to pursue a confrontational policy is severely circumscribed .
Real power in the Islamic republic lies not with the presidency but with the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
The fundamentalist Mr Ahmadinejad is a protege of the ayatollah , who backed him last summer against reformist candidates .
And the unelected supreme leader , along with the mullahs ' Guardian Council , has the final say on major issues of state .
Mr Ahmadinejad is in a minority even among conservatives .
According to Ray Takeyh of the US - based Council on Foreign Relations , a consensus emerged during Muhammad Khatami 's presidency that post - revolutionary Iran could no longer afford global isolation of the kind this week 's gaffe engendered Mr Khamenei did much to undermine Mr Khatami 's modest political reforms .
He would not countenance a rapprochement with the "" Great Satan "" ( America ) .
But he encouraged bridge - building elsewhere . ""
By cultivating favourable relations with key international actors such as China , Russia and the European Union , Tehran has sought to craft its own ' coalition of the willing ' and prevent the US from multilateralising its coercive approach to Iran , "" Mr Takeyh wrote . ""
Although the Islamic Republic continues its inflammatory support for terrorist organisations battling Israel and is pressing ahead with its nuclear programme , its foreign policy is no longer that of a revolutionary state .
This perspective will survive Iran 's latest leadership transition . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad , a blacksmith 's son , former revolutionary guard and ex - mayor of Tehran , based his appeal to voters on social justice and personal humility .
His demand for a "" second revolution "" implied criticism of corrupt clerical and secular elites controlling much of Iran 's oil - funded economy .
He has almost no experience in international affairs .
His appearance at the UN last month , when he denounced the west 's "" nuclear apartheid "" , was adjudged a diplomatic disaster .
And he has a stubborn streak .
One of his first actions was to appoint a fellow hardliner , Ali Larijani , as head of Iran 's nuclear negotiating team .
The talks quickly hit the rocks .
In apparent defiance of Mr Khamenei , he has reportedly sought counsel in Qom from Ayatollah Mohammad - Taghi Mesbah - Yazdi , the fundamentalists ' anti - western "" spiritual father "" .
But the president faces additional constraints .
His defeated rival , Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , continues to chair the influential Expediency Council .
The council has gained an expanded role overseeing all branches of Iran 's power structure .
Earlier this month , Mr Rafsanjani appeared to reprimand the new leadership for "" sloganeering "" .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's electoral honeymoon has also been brief .
He is under fire for failing to share out oil income and create jobs .
There have been rows over cabinet appointments and control of the oil ministry .
And there are insidious suggestions that he is out of his depth .
All this may explain his apparent need to adopt "" bold "" leadership postures .
But spectacular international own goals and domestic underperformance suggest he could become a liability to his turbaned tutelars ."
2005-10-28,"Carrying a large Palestinian flag and decked out in a chequered kaffiyeh and black Arabian chador , Monir Kohandani looked every inch the committed freedom fighter and willing martyr deified by Iran 's Islamic regime .
But as she participated along with thousands of others in yesterday 's annual al - Quds ( Jerusalem ) day march - organised by Iran 's ruling mullahs in a show of religious strength against Zionism - it was unclear whether she appreciated the stakes involved in the cause for which she was marching .
Asked for her views on President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's remark that Israel "" must be wiped off the map "" , Ms Kohandani , a 21-year - old law student , was unreflecting .
"" Whatever he says is right , his words are Islam 's words , "" she said .
"" Israel is of no importance to Iran .
We do n't believe in it as a country .
The word ' Israel ' does n't exist on our maps .
We write Palestine instead . ""
Ms Kohandani 's response represents the unyielding view of regime loyalists on Israel , to whose destruction Iran has been committed - at least rhetorically - since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
Yesterday that commitment was under scrutiny as never before from a world outraged at the spectacle of a head of state apparently calling for another country 's annihilation .
In the face of the regime 's uncompromising stance , many Iranians are uninformed about the nuances of the conflict .
Talk of Israeli "" massacres "" of Palestinians is commonplace .
Pro -
regime artwork plays a role in this interpretation .
Huge murals depicting perceived Israeli atrocities are plastered on walls across Tehran .
One of the most striking portrays the death of 12-year - old Mohammed al - Durra , killed in the crossfire between Israeli troops and Palestinian gunmen in Gaza five years ago .
Otherwise , the Iranian public is reliant on a diet of propaganda fed by the state - controlled media .
Yesterday , that diet was served up in giant platefuls .
Throughout the day , state television ran a harrowing series of images of Palestinian suffering .
There was no mention of the international condemnation triggered by Mr Ahmadinejad 's remarks .
Instead , the focus was on Tehran University , where tens of thousands congregated in an apparently monolithic endorsement of their president 's position .
They had been ferried in by dozens of buses provided by the government .
Many demonstrators , including young children , carried banners repeating Mr Ahmadinejad 's words .
Another banner read : "" The only way to combat the Zionist enemy is resistance and Jihad . ""
Organisers handed out carrier bags emblazoned with a burning Star of David and stating : "" Yesterday Lebanon , today Gaza , tomorrow Palestine . ""
For the regime , the turnout may have been the perfect riposte to the outcry .
Yet among some present there was an awareness that the president 's comments needed clarification . ""
He did n't mean wiping the Jewish people off the map .
We do n't have a problem with them , "" said Muhammad Ali Chitsaz , 36 , a dentist .
"" We can have peaceful coexistence with them .
What we are against is their treatment of the Palestinians .
They should allow the Palestinians to return to their homeland and then decide the government on the basis of who is the majority . ""
Some Iranians , indifferent to a conflict they see as the business of Jews and Arabs , think Mr Ahmadinejad has his priorities wrong . ""
Rather than paying attention to Israel , we should be asking how economically corrupt people have managed to penetrate our system , "" said Pezman Noghreyi , 27 .
Others fear a backlash from the US and Israel .
"" We need to maintain our relations with the outside world , "" said Hamid , 25 , a designer .
"" If the UN can convince the Israelis to treat the Palestinians better , so that there were n't any more massacres , that would be better than wiping them off the map . ""
Muhammad Motamedi , 55 , a consultant at a research institute , said Mr Ahmadinejad had been misinterpreted .
"" What he meant was that today 's government of Israel should be wiped off the map , not the nation of Israel , "" he said .
"" But it is possible that his comments are going to play into the hands of Bush and Sharon . ""
Hamed Babayi , 27 , an agricultural engineering student , said he was "" proud "" of the president .
"" I am proud of him because he is speaking strongly against superpowers like Israel and America .
I have promised myself that I would go to war against Israel , America or any other country that attacks Iran .
We should wipe not only the government of Israel , but also those of America and Britain off the map .
But we do n't mean their people . """
2005-10-28,"There is no real reason to suppose that Iranian policy toward Israel , which in recent years has been marked by occasional verbal extremism and by support for Palestinian radical groups but also by a recognition that Israel is a permanent fact of life in the Middle East , suddenly changed this week .
But President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's call for the Jewish state to be wiped from the map nevertheless represents a rhetorical regression that is to be deplored for many reasons .
First , no statement calling for Israel 's destruction can be allowed to pass , particularly when it comes from a leader whose country may , as Tony Blair has said , at some future point possess nuclear weapons .
Second , his words compromise Iran 's relationship with Europe , making it less likely that stalled talks with the European troika on the Iranian nuclear programme can resume with a chance of success , and more likely that Iran 's nuclear activities will be referred to the UN security council .
Third , this Iranian provocation distracts attention from the campaign of suppression Israel is conducting in the West Bank and Gaza at a time when the international community 's eyes ought to be firmly fixed on the Sharon government 's actions and manoeuvres .
Fourth , these are the kind of words which play into the hands of those who might want to revive the "" axis of evil "" rhetoric of the past .
American or Israeli military action against Iran may still remain remote , but the Iranian president could have brought that undesirable prospect a little bit closer .
None of these possible consequences is in Iran 's interest .
In short , President Ahmadinejad has hit every duck in his own row .
That is perhaps now a matter of private regret to him and to at least some advisers .
Iranian diplomats round the world , particularly in countries such as Russia which could until now have been depended on to take Iran 's part in the security council and other international forums , must be tearing their hair out .
The Moscow embassy even issued an explanation saying the president had not intended to speak "" in such sharp terms "" .
His critics within the divided Iranian establishment will seize on this episode as more proof that he is not up to his job .
That , they would claim , is showing in domestic affairs as well , for the president 's promises during the election campaign that he would tackle corruption , create more jobs and ensure that Iran 's oil income was distributed more fairly have not so far been followed by any solid results , although there have been some corruption arrests .
By contrast , he has delivered promptly on his commitment to battle liberalism , feminism and secularism , banning films , closing websites and sending out enforcers to pull the chador firmly down on the foreheads of Iranian women again , and is good on staging huge demonstrations such as the anti - Israel ones in Iran yesterday .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's characteristic combination of obtuseness and clumsiness was already apparent when he addressed the UN general assembly in September , and it was evident again yesterday when he insisted that his words "" were the Iranian nation 's words "" .
It is not at all clear that this is the case .
Outside the ranks of hardliners , ordinary Iranians , many observers believe , would be ready to accept what most of the rest of the world wants , which is that Israel should fully withdraw from the occupied territories and that a viable Palestinian state should come into being .
This is precisely what Mr Ahmadinejad is making more difficult at a time when Ariel Sharon 's deliberate fragmentation of Jerusalem and the West Bank is preparing the way for an ultimate territorial solution that would give Palestinians no basis for statehood worthy of the name .
Why does n't the Iranian leader draw a bead on that important target instead of belching menace in every direction ?"
2005-10-30,"Under massive international condemnation , Iran moved rapidly to explain that its president 's call for Israel to be ' wiped off the map ' should in no way be taken as a threat of violence .
As the UN Security Council joined secretary - general Kofi Annan , Tony Blair , Washington and a growing chorus in condemning Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's remarks , diplomats and officials sought to defuse the row . '
The Islamic Republic of Iran is committed to its UN Charter commitments , ' a Foreign Ministry statement read yesterday . '
It has never used force against a second country or threatened the use of force . '
The comments by the conservative Ahmadinejad in a speech to students at a conference marking the annual Jerusalem Day , represented only his latest catastrophic blunder in presenting Iran 's relationship with the outside world since taking up the presidency three months ago .
Since he spoke on Wednesday , Tehran 's complex and competing centres of power have been plunged into a spin of contradictory briefing , with hardliners - including the head of the Revolutionary Guards - backing Ahmadinejad and reformers trying to repair the damage .
In a mark of growing political polarisation , senior officials in the reformist camp have privately begun to wonder whether Ahmadinejad has the intelligence or skills to lead Iran at such a crucial juncture ; others accuse him of living in the past .
While Ahmadinejad stuck by his comments on Friday , by yesterday , while not specifically rebutting the president 's remarks , the Foreign Ministry said Iran had no intention of launching an assault on the Jewish state and would back whatever course the Palestinians chose to resolve the Middle East conflict .
The Iranian Embassy in Moscow - Russia is backing Iran 's attempts to secure civil nuclear technology - also issued a statement that belittled Ahmadinejad 's comments , saying that ' he did not have any intention to speak up in such sharp terms and enter into a conflict ' .
However , reassuring messages are unlikely in the short term to remove suspicions about Iran 's trajectory .
The US said his remarks underscored its fears that Tehran was pursuing nuclear arms .
Tehran denies the charge , arguing it needs atomic fuel for power stations .
The Foreign Ministry statement said Ahmadinejad had mapped out Iran 's policy on Israel at the UN in New York last month . '
The official stance ... is that the occupation of Palestine should end , refugees should return and a democratic state should be formed with Jerusalem as its capital , ' the statement added .
Ali Larijani , head of Iran 's Supreme National Security Council , told the ISNA students news agency that Iran would back whatever the Palestinians chose .
Ahmad Nateq Nouri , a senior conservative cleric and member of the Expediency Council also played down the president 's comments : ' What the president meant was that we favour a fair and long - lasting peace in Palestine . '
This was the stance taken by Iran 's reformist government under former President Mohammad Khatami , whose eight - year presidency ended this year , a policy that left the path open for a two - state solution ."
2005-10-30,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's belligerent new President , wears his revolutionary heritage on his sleeve .
On Friday , he was revisiting his days as a student follower of Ayatollah Khomeini and rallying demonstrators in the street against Israel to mark ' Jerusalem Day ' , the fourth Friday of Ramadan , reiterating his predictions of Israel 's demise .
Ahmadinejad has been playing with fire these last few days .
Twice last week , he has appeared to threaten Israel , attracting almost universal opprobrium .
It is certainly dangerous , but how worried should we be ?
There is an element of bluster .
After weeks and months of fractious diplomacy , after accusations and counter - accusations in Iran 's belligerent Cold War with the UK , after the noises from Washington about changing regimes , Ahmadinejad is confronting us with the default position that was once the favourite fall - back of Saddam .
That is , when under threat , publicly wrap yourself in the cloak of the defender of Palestine and the hammer of Israel .
If the President 's words , made to a conference on a ' World Without Zionism ' , and repeated defiantly the following day at a street demonstration , tell us anything , it is how little certain factions in Iran have been paying attention to world events in the past few years .
For if Iran should have learned anything from recent history , especially from events on its own borders , it is that as a tactic , whether offensive or defensive , threatening Israel publicly is counterproductive in the extreme .
Iran is already under close scrutiny for its pursuit of a nuclear programme which the international community sees as a threat to world peace .
For that country 's President to voice a desire to ' wipe Israel off the map ' at such a time is a serious and dangerous misjudgment and casts serious doubt on Iraq 's claim to harbour only peaceful ambitions for its nuclear technology .
An indication of the scale of the misjudgment can be found in the fact that the most powerful of the condemnations in the past few days came not from a member of the Security Council but from a Palestinian - Saeb Erekat , the Palestinian Authority 's chief negotiator .
He denounced the comments as ' unacceptable ' , adding for good measure that the PA itself ' recognised the state of Israel ' .
But loathsome as the comment is , it is worth maintaining some perspective .
The fact that the Iranian regime is hostile to Israel ( and the US ) is hardly news : Iran refuses to recognise the legitimacy of the foundation of the Jewish state ; it backs both Hizbollah and Hamas ; and anti - Israeli diatribes are common at Friday prayers .
Indeed , the conference at which Ahmadinejad was speaking has been an annual feature of Tehran 's political scene since the days of Khomeini .
All this has long been grist to the mill of Israel 's diplomacy , which , in the aftermath of the Iraq invasion , has been focused on persuading Washington that Iran was always actually the greater threat and is ripe for similar treatment .
But , despite the history of mutual animosity , the deliberately antagonistic nature of last week 's comments still demand an explanation of why Iran - or Ahmadinejad and the hardliners who surround him - has decided to indulge in poisonous rhetoric at this time .
His speech had as much to do with Iran 's complex internal and regional politics as with Israel .
At the centre is the nature of Ahmadinejad 's power base and ambitions , a reprise of the revolutionary fervour of Khomeini 's rule and an attempt to reassert its original ideals .
Ahmadinejad believes these have been diluted by the years of reform during the Khatami years .
By his own admission , when Ahmadinejad made his remarks about the inevitability of Israel 's demise , he was quoting Khomeini .
But today 's President has a less firm power and support base .
Remarkably , in a country where ' death to Israel ' chants have been an almost permanent feature of street politics , the President 's comments have caused a furore .
The reason is that Iran has changed since Khomeini .
Despite the continued grip on power by institutions set up by Khomeini , a large part of its youthful population has made complex accommodations between life lived in public and private .
That has masked the loosening of those institutions ' grip on the individual .
The newly resurgent hardliners , with their strongest support among the poor and ill - educated , are now trying to reimpose that grip .
It is clear , however , that they will have a struggle .
The fear and control of the Khomeini years has been diluted .
Power has been diffused through competing institutions : religious , governmental and military .
Ahmadinejad has responding by trying to use the simple certainties of the past as a nationally uniting theme .
But there is a second , increasingly noisy , theme - the enunciation of a growing sense of Shia power , not least via the Shia ascendancy in Iraq .
This has given Iran a new sense of entitlement as a coming regional power , reflected in its dogged pursuit of the right to have a nuclear programme .
To Iran 's growing irritation , this vision of its growing importance is taken insufficiently seriously on the international stage .
In short , Iran has felt assaulted on multiple fronts : accused by the West of interfering in Iraq , accused of supporting terrorism and accused over the nature of its nuclear ambitions and its tutelage of Hizbollah in Lebanon which it is now being told should be disarmed .
All these pressing issues require a more skilful diplomat and politician than Ahmadinejad .
The hectoring revolutionary jargon of his speech last week , with its talk of hegemonies and struggle and appropriate revolutionary behaviour , suggests a lack of any subtlety .
It was left to his political rival , the reformist - minded and more subtle former President , Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , to attempt to defuse the row by insisting : ' We have no problems with Jews and highly respect Judaism as a holy religion .
We only have problems with Zionist circles in Israel which we hold responsible for the suppression of the Palestinian nation . '
Iran acts like a dictatorship and yet proudly proclaims its democracy ; its isolation has bred a particular kind of paranoia and its sense of being has been thwarted in its regional ambitions .
All this has bred a sullen inferiority complex .
Put under pressure , Ahmadinejad has retreated behind the old and troubling slogans of the past .
Still , this affair should be regarded as only the latest spike in the rapidly worsening relationship between Iran and the West after the encouraging years of tentative engagement during the Khatami regime .
That has seemed in the past few months so much like ancient history .
Instead , the whole trajectory of recent diplomacy with Iran - from Washington , and particularly from London - has been a series of hamfisted , confused and hyperventilated interventions , culminating in the Prime Minister 's retreat to his own fall - back position : to mutter vaguely about military action .
But at the very heart of it , what is most shocking is that there is a pointlessness about this international kerfuffle that almost defies belief .
Iran knows it will never carry out its threat .
Ahmadinejad 's comments , if anything , are an indication of his own weakness .
The bellicose noise on Britain 's side , however , is no less pointless with the Prime Minister 's veiled threat made in the knowledge that while embroiled in a war on Iran 's border , the chances of meaningful military action to enforce change in Iran , even if it were desirable , are negligible .
Ahmadinejad 's comments do not signify a real and heightened threat .
They express a vicious stalemate .
The beneficiary , ironically for Iran , is Israel whose hand in Washington is strengthened .
But such speeches bolster extremists .
The lesson of Iraq is that talking up a crisis can become a self - fulfilling prophesy .
And it is bringing us no closer to solving the urgent problems posed to world peace by an increasingly complex Iran ."
2005-11-01,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has embarked on a purge of senior Iranian diplomats , with the ambassador to London among his first victims .
The sackings will create further alarm in western capitals over Mr Ahmadinejad , who has made a series of hardline pronouncements since becoming president in the summer .
Iranian and western diplomatic sources confirmed last night that Seyed Muhammad Hossein Adeli , who was posted to London last year , had been sacked .
According to western diplomats , Muhammad Reza Alborzi , Iran 's ambassador to the UN in Geneva , was also being recalled , sources said .
The purge comes less than a week after the president was widely condemned for calling for Israel to be wiped off the map .
Mr Alborzi was part of an Iranian delegation involved in failed negotiations with Britain , France and Germany in Paris this year over Tehran 's nuclear programme .
Iran is desperately trying to avoid referral of the nuclear issue to the UN security council and western diplomats suggested that Mr Ahmadinejad may be conducting a clear - out of Iranian diplomats involved in these negotiations .
The US , EU and Israel suspect that Iran is covertly engaged in pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability .
Tehran denies this .
Western diplomatic sources suggested that the purge is related to the nuclear negotiations .
Mr Ahmadinejad had complained that some diplomats had sided too much with European negotiators and failed to represent Iran 's national interest .
An Iranian source said there were several reasons for Dr Adeli 's sacking , but denied that these included the nuclear issue or the call to wipe out Israel .
Dr Adeli , who returned to London late last week from discussions in Tehran , had proved to be a relatively popular ambassador in London .
He was less reserved than his predecessors and prepared to make Iran 's case in the media .
He is a former governor of the Iranian central bank .
Since Mr Ahmadinejad became president Iran has effectively broken off talks with Britain , France and Germany by resuming uranium conversion , an early step towards nuclear weapons capability .
It yesterday handed over additional documentation to the International Atomic Energy Agency in an attempt to avoid referral to the UN security council .
Muhammad Saeedi , deputy head of Iran 's Atomic Energy Organisation , said there was good cooperation with UN inspectors ."
2005-11-03,"In a move which will harden Iran 's foreign policy , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is removing more than 40 ambassadors and senior diplomats , including many who have favoured warmer ties with the west .
It is the Islamic republic 's biggest diplomatic purge since the 1979 revolution and the populist - conservative president , who took over in August , is expected to replace the ambassadors with his own supporters .
Mr Ahmadinejad has adopted a tougher line on many issues , particularly negotiations with Europe over Iran 's controversial nuclear programme .
Hardliners have criticised the previous government of President Mohammad Khatami for agreeing to freeze nuclear activities during the talks , and Mr Ahmadinejad has already replaced many of the negotiators .
On Monday the Guardian revealed that the ambassador in London , Muhammad Hossein Adeli - a relatively popular figure in the diplomatic community - had been sacked after only a year , together with Iran 's ambassador to the UN in Geneva .
Last week Mr Ahmadinejad caused an international storm by saying Israel should be "" wiped off the map "" .
Iran has summoned Italy 's ambassador to Tehran to protest at a pro - Israeli rally outside the Iranian embassy in Rome today denouncing his comments .
The scale of the shake - up became clear yesterday when foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki told the Iranian parliament that "" the missions of more than 40 ambassadors and heads of Iranian diplomatic missions abroad will expire by the end of the year "" , which is March 20 2006 under the Iranian calendar .
Mr Mottaki , whose remarks were reported by the Islamic Republic News Agency , did not specify which ambassadors would be removed .
There were further conflicting signals about Iran 's nuclear intentions yesterday when diplomats said it had granted UN inspectors access to a military site but had also decided to begin processing a new batch of uranium at its Isfahan plant next week .
Iran had frozen all work there late last year under a deal with France , Britain and Germany , but it resumed work at the plant in August , prompting the EU 's three biggest powers to suspend talks .
More than 10,000 Iranians burned flags and chanted slogans against Israel and the US outside the former US embassy in Tehran yesterday .
Also in the capital a homemade grenade caused minor damage outside the British Airways offices .
No casualties were reported ."
2005-11-07,"Iran moved yesterday to lessen its international isolation by offering to reopen talks about its nuclear programme with the European Union .
The proposal , by Ali Larijani , secretary of Iran 's supreme national security council , was clearly designed to ease diplomatic pressures that had been mounting since a call by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to "" wipe Israel off the map "" .
However , the move did not appear to represent a significant shift in Iran 's position on its nuclear programme .
It continued to insist yesterday on its determination to pursue a "" peaceful "" nuclear programme .
Mr Larijani 's call for renewed talks came in a letter addressed to the foreign ministers of the EU trio of Britain , France and Germany , who had been spearheading long - running negotiations before they were suspended in August after Iran resumed uranium conversion .
Quoted by the semi - official Fars news agency , the letter "" assessed the past exchanges and welcomed rational and constructive negotiations in the framework of international regulations "" .
The olive branch appeared to be part of a concerted effort to head off the possibility of Iran being referred to the UN security council at a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency this month .
Yesterday , Iran announced it had allowed IAEA inspectors to tour the Parchin military complex , 20 miles south of Tehran .
The Bush administration , which suspects Iran of trying to develop an atomic bomb , has claimed Parchin has been used to develop high explosives compatible with nuclear weapons .
In a clear sign of Iran 's increasingly lonely international status , the UN secretary general , Kofi Annan , has cancelled a visit to Tehran scheduled for next week .
Iran 's need to address its growing isolation will be highlighted at a meeting of European foreign ministers in Brussels today , at which the EU 's policy of engagement with Tehran will be reviewed .
The meeting is expected condemn Mr Ahmadinejad 's anti - Israel tirade and demand Iran lift ad hoc trade sanctions against Britain .
The embargo was imposed last month in protest at Britain 's stand against Iran 's nuclear programme .
The Italian foreign ministry yesterday responded to accusations by its Iranian counterpart that Italy was trying to isolate Iran after pro - Israel demonstrations in Rome and other cities . ""
No one wants to isolate Iran , "" an Italian foreign ministry spokesman said .
"" On the contrary , we all hope that Tehran , adopting responsible conduct , wants to play a role of stabilisation .
But it is Iran which inevitably isolates itself the moment it denies to exist another people and another state . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad 's comments , together with a need to act ahead of today 's EU meeting , had acted as a "" catalyst "" to yesterday 's conciliatory move , a Tehran - based political analyst told the Guardian .
"" Iran has the lower hand now , "" the analyst said .
"" These remarks were definitely not helpful ...
Quite apart from giving Israel an opportunity to attack and launch a propaganda offensive , they put Iran in a vulnerable position .
Now , in any conversation in which Iran tries to defend its goodwill and honest nature , the other side can say , your president called for the annihilation of Israel , a member of the UN .
How do you expect us to trust you ? """
2005-11-09,"Like a speed - crazed driver of a Paykan - the anachronistic Hillman Hunter prototype that remains king of Iran 's roads - Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is steering his country in a reckless fashion , without due care for oncoming traffic or blind bends , and as with the ageing saloon car , there is no guarantee that the engine of the Iranian state is equipped to take such rough handling .
The number of heedless political risks taken by Iran 's fundamentalist president seems to grow by the day .
So too does the sensation of a cataclysmic accident waiting to happen .
In the space of six days during the past fortnight , Mr Ahmadinejad provoked a tidal wave of international condemnation by calling for Israel to be "" wiped off the map "" before raising diplomatic temperatures from incandescent to white heat levels with a purge of Iranian foreign service personnel that saw 40 ambassadors and senior officials sacked at once .
Meanwhile , his government stridently asserts its right to develop a nuclear programme when the International Atomic Energy Agency is edging closer to referring Iran to the UN security council .
It is hardly a textbook demonstration of politics as the art of the possible .
But like his religiously devout US counterpart , who once dismissed President Bush the elder as the wrong father from whom to seek strength in times of crisis , Mr Ahmadinejad 's actions are drawn from an inspiration far transcending mundane political realities .
To his compatriots , the president 's iconoclastic exploits on the global stage are n't the half of it .
Of more immediate concern here are his actions at home , which yield no quarter to political convention or constructive criticism .
The high - velocity collision invited by this approach was narrowly averted today when Mr Ahmadinejad 's nomination for the key oil ministry , Sadeq Mahsouli , withdrew his candidacy just hours before it went to a parliamentary vote .
Even in a parliament dominated by religious conservatives nominally supportive of his fundamentalist agenda , the president 's nominee had appeared to be heading for almost certain rejection after being dismissed as an unqualified crony with no knowledge of the oil industry .
Having already had his original choice rejected on the same grounds , today 's 11th hour retreat may yet sound the death knell to Mr Ahmadinejad 's goal of using Iran 's oil wealth to help the poor and reduce inequality .
The president 's economic agenda is already in trouble .
The anticipated capital flight , feared as a consequence of his election , has come to pass and investment has plummeted .
With financial markets alarmed by his call for interest rate cuts by decree in the face of rising inflation , the Tehran stock exchange has plunged 25 % in the past four months .
Mr Ahmadinejad , noted for his fierce temper and rudeness towards aides , reportedly told a recent cabinet meeting that the problems could be solved "" if they allowed us to execute two or three individuals "" .
It has not come to that yet .
But last week the heads of six leading banks received the ambassadorial treatment when they were summarily replaced by men hand - picked by the Ahmadinejad government .
With his unsurpassed revolutionary credentials , it is perhaps not surprising that the new man in Tehran is not a believer in continuity .
What is striking , however , is that , like George W eschewing the guidance of his biological father , Mr Ahmadinejad seems to take his cue from somewhere other than the expected source .
Rather than show unstinting loyalty to Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the president is said to be under the spell of Ayatollah Mohammad Taghi Mesbah - Yazdi , an ultra - hardliner espousing total isolation from the west .
Some observers think Mr Ahmadinejad and his followers believe Mr Mesbah - Yazdi would make a better supreme leader than Mr Khamenei , a conviction that could have profound implications for the future of the country 's Islamic power structure .
Behind this opaque window of deftly shifting loyalties lurks another influential figure , a Karl Rove character , although the parallels are inexact .
Mojtaba Hashemi Samareh , a devotee of Mr Mesbah - Yazdi , is Mr Ahmadinejad 's de facto chief of staff and bestrides his government .
In contrast to his brusque approach to other associates , the president treats Mr Samareh with reverential respect , standing behind him diffidently at prayers .
Mr Samareh is notoriously publicity shy , but his past role in Iran 's foreign ministry shines the brightest light of all on the country 's new approach to diplomacy and the outside world .
During the early 90s , Mr Samareh was director of the ministry 's placements office , affording him a big say over who got plum foreign postings and almost dictatorial powers over how they behaved once they got them .
According to Iranian website Rooz Online , Mr Samareh composed a training programme called The Psychology of the Infidels , which provided insights on how to trap staff and the use of sex in procuring information or intelligence .
Particularly arresting was his notion of the model Islamic diplomat .
In Mr Samareh 's view , this was the very antithesis of the well - groomed urbane socialite found in embassies the world over .
A corrupted Iranian diplomat was one who wore perfectly creased trousers and polished , lace - up shoes and who smiled at strangers .
Smart shoes and trousers were a sign of insufficient commitment to prayer and of being seduced by "" royalty "" .
Only shoes that were bent at the back and easily removable for prayer would do .
Smiling at strangers was a "" western "" habit bespeaking weakness to foreign visitors who should be assumed to be spies .
In a world where appearance and human interaction mean so much , it is a disquietingly eccentric set of values .
And its shaper is the back - seat driver in President Ahmadinejad 's Paykan as it continues its white - knuckle ride to no one quite knows where ."
2005-11-10,"Iran appeared to be entering a period of potentially damaging political uncertainty yesterday after the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , was forced to withdraw his nomination to head the oil ministry .

He is the second prospective oil minister nominated by Mr Ahmadinejad to fall foul of MPs .

2005-11-18,"Iran is facing political paralysis as its newly elected president purges government institutions , bringing accusations that he is undertaking a coup d'état .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's clearout of his opponents began last month but is more sweeping than previously understood and has reached almost every branch of government , the Guardian has learned .
Dozens of deputy ministers have been sacked this month in several government departments , as well the heads of the state insurance and privatisation organisations .
Last week , seven state bank presidents were dismissed in what an Iranian source described as "" a coup d'état "" .
An informed Iranian source with first - hand knowledge of all the main political and clerical figures in the country said : "" Ahmadinejad is defying everybody .
He does whatever he wants and considers it to be right .
This is not how things are done in Iran . ""
The upheaval at the highest government levels in Tehran follows the dismissal of four senior ambassadors and has raised questions about Iran 's ability to conclude negotiations on its nuclear programme which are due to come to a head at a UN meeting in Vienna next week .
Mr Ahmadinejad drew international condemnation after he made comments about wiping Israel off the map .
Concern about the government 's isolationist stance has been increased by claims from Tony Blair that Iran is aiding bombmakers attacking British troops in south - east Iraq .
Growing resistance inside Iran to Mr Ahmadinejad , who was unexpectedly elected in June , is coming from several senior figures and sections of the media .
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , a former president who was runner - up in the election , denounced the purge and , in comments reported by Iranian news agencies , suggested the president should be reined in .
"" A tendency in Iran is trying to banish competent officials and it is harming the country like a plague , "" Mr Rafsanjani said .
"" Our society has been divided into two poles and some people are behaving aggressively . ""
Hassan Rohani , sacked as Iran 's senior nuclear negotiator , told Tehran newspapers that the negotiations with the west were being mishandled .
The former president Mohammad Khatami also voiced concern that Mr Ahmadinejad was exceeding his powers .
In a sign of divisions at the top of the clerical establishment , the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has until now supported Mr Ahmadinejad , said "" irregularities "" in the government 's behaviour would not be tolerated .
Iranian sources said opinion in the conservative - controlled majlis [ parliament ] , which initially welcomed the president 's election , was becoming uneasy .
There has been a series of rows about Mr Ahmadinejad 's nominees to top ministry jobs , including in the oil ministry .
The stock market has fallen 30 % since the new president took office , and there is growing criticism of his failure to deliver on promises to create jobs and raise living standards .
"" There is a very tense situation .
Ahmadinejad has made a very bad start and needs to get attuned to political realities , "" the Iranian source said , suggesting that Mr Ahmadinejad could face impeachment proceedings in the majlis if he continued to pack the government with his appointees .
But the source said western threats of economic sanctions or military action against Iran were strengthening Mr Ahmadinejad at the expense of moderate conservatives , liberals and reformers .
Paralysis at the top of the Iranian government could pose serious problems for the west as it struggles to resolve the nuclear stand - off .
Iran began processing a fresh batch of uranium yesterday in spite of compromise proposals .
Next week 's UN meeting will debate whether to refer Iran to the security council for possible action ."
2005-11-18,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad faces a range of critical problems with the west , ranging from Iran 's nuclear ambitions to its deep hostility to Israel .
But the Iranian president 's handling of these flashpoints is also creating internal problems - reaching the highest levels in Tehran .
Mr Ahmadinejad has divided the powerful clerical establishment as well as alienating moderates , an informed Iranian source said yesterday .
"" He is defying everybody .
But he is not a power that can not be challenged . ""
The president 's most controversial step was his comment that Israel was a blot that should be "" wiped off the map "" .
His words brought international condemnation and delighted Iran 's many enemies , who said they demonstrated the problems they faced in trying to deal rationally with Tehran .
The Iranian source said : "" What he said about Israel united everyone .
It delighted the American neo - cons , it delighted all our Arab rivals , it delighted the Israelis and it delighted - at the emotional level - the poor , long - suffering Palestinians .
But it was totally against Iran 's national interest . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad 's mixture of confrontationalism and inexperience is increasing ructions at home .
Several rows have flared about his nominees for key ministries - in particular the oil ministry - with MPs complaining about a failure to consult .
His purge of dozens of senior ministers , officials and diplomats brought an unusual rebuke this week from Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , a former president whom he beat in this year 's presidential election and who chairs the Expediency Council , a government oversight body .
Plans to enlarge the ambassadorial cull to include up to 40 diplomats were shelved following angry political and media reaction in Tehran .
For Iran 's population at large , it is the president 's failure so far to create jobs , raise living standards or crack down on corruption associated with Iran 's oil industry that is most serious .
His planned extension of state controls of the economy and his peremptory sacking of seven state bank presidents has undermined business confidence .
His idea of offering state handouts to newlyweds has not changed public perception that he and his inexperienced cabinet have failed to get to grips with the main economic problems for the country 's 70 million people . ""
The first test of popularity for the new government will come with municipal elections next year and elections for the Assembly of Experts [ who elect the supreme leader or senior cleric ] , "" the source said .
"" But if he continues like this , he could face impeachment in the majlis [ parliament ] if the conservative majority turns against him .
There will be no ' Orange Revolution ' in Iran , but popular discontent on the streets could grow . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad had his first opportunity to set a new tone when he addressed the UN summit in New York in September .
His confrontational speech , in which he insisted on Iran 's inalienable right to develop weapons - related nuclear technology , dismayed Britain , France and Germany , the three EU countries that have been negotiating over the nuclear dispute for two years .
Within days of taking office , Mr Ahmadinejad sacked Iran 's top nuclear negotiator , Hassan Rohani , and ordered the resumption of uranium conversion , the first step towards a possible nuclear weapon capability .
Dealing with the potentially dangerous situation within Tehran poses a fresh headache for western governments .
But the international community is as divided as the Iranians .
Scarred by memories of the run - up to the Iraq war , divisions have emerged between leading UN countries .
Russia and China oppose a rush to sanctions , and India , which has signed an energy deal with Iran , also favours a gradual approach .
Britain , France and Germany have used the nuclear negotiations to boost a concept of a European foreign policy while holding back a more confrontational US administration .
But even here there are splits over tactics .
British officials admit there is a difference in approach between Tony Blair and his foreign secretary , Jack Straw .
While Mr Straw has repeatedly said military action against Iran over its nuclear policy is "" inconceivable "" , Mr Blair has sought to keep the Iranians guessing .
He favours challenging Iran not only on the nuclear issue but on human rights , and even the legitimacy of its democracy .
He also wants to encourage growth of a civil society .
But Iranian officials calculate that George Bush , distracted by Iraq , is unlikely to seek another confrontation ."
2005-11-24,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , was propelled into a crisis yesterday after MPs rejected his third nominee as oil minister , the most strategically sensitive post in his government .
Amid a rising chorus of domestic criticism of the president 's confrontational style , the Iranian parliament , the majlis , rebuffed his choice of Mohsen Tasalloti for a job that entails control over the lion 's share of the economy .
Mr Tasalloti , a former revolutionary guard comrade of the president , had been beset by rumours that he is a millionaire with a green card for the US and has a daughter living in Britain .
Mr Ahmadinejad yesterday called the claims "" unjust "" and said parliament 's decision was "" not fair "" .
But it was clear that the reservations over Mr Tasalloti 's personal shortcomings were little more than a front for a bitter struggle for control of Iran 's key industry between radical Islamist supporters of Mr Ahmadinejad and traditional conservatives backing Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the Islamic state 's supreme leader and its pivotal religious and political figure .
Two weeks ago , Mr Ahmadinejad 's second choice for oil minister , Sadeq Mahsouli , withdrew because he lacked sufficient parliamentary support to win approval .
The original nominee was rejected in August .
With the official deadline for approval of cabinet ministers expiring today , the next oil minister of the world 's fourth - biggest producer of the fuel may now be chosen either by the Guardian Council - a religious watchdog loyal to Mr Khamenei , or by the Expediency Council , an organisation headed by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , who was defeated by Mr Ahmadinejad in this year 's presidential election and has since been very critical of the president 's political performance .
Losing control over the appointment would deal a serious blow to Mr Ahmadinejad , who won the June poll largely due to promises to redistribute Iran 's oil wealth to the poor .
It follows speculation that he may be impeached over a controversial political record that has so far included the sacking of four senior Iranian ambassadors and seven state bank chiefs , as well as the removal of a host of less prominent figures and a 25 % slump in stock exchange values .
"" We have never before seen this kind of conflict between parliament and the government , even before the revolution , "" said a Tehran - based political analyst , Saeed Leylaz .
But "" Iran is earning oil revenues of about $ 110 m , [ £ 69 m ] per day and that is big enough to compensate for the [ president 's political ] mismanagement . """
2005-12-05,"Iran is to build a second nuclear reactor to match the plant currently under construction in the coastal city of Bushehr , state television reported today .
The decision came after a meeting of the country 's cabinet and president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad last night .
The reactor has been on the drawing board since the 1970s and comes as part of government plans to build up to 20 nuclear plants with Russian help .
But concerns over Iran 's intentions on nuclear weapons mean that the announcement will inevitably be viewed as a provocation .
The US argues that Iran wants to develop its own nuclear weapons , although Tehran says it only intends to use the plants for electricity generation .
British diplomats last month told the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) that documents held by Iran suggest the government intends to manufacture nuclear warheads .
Talks with the European Union on the status of Iran 's nuclear programme broke down in August after Tehran resumed uranium conversion , a first step towards producing reactor - grade fuel .
The IAEA has asked Iran to halt its uranium enrichment programme , which can turn converted uranium into either reactor - grade or weapons - grade material .
But despite Tehran putting the programme on hold , Iran 's powerful Guardian Council ruled on Saturday that enrichment should go ahead regardless of international pressure .
In a sign of the escalating tension over the issue , the former Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu told Israel 's Maariv newspaper that he would consider a pre - emptive strike against Iranian nuclear facilities if elected leader .
Mr Netanyahu , who is campaigning for leadership of the rightwing Likud party after founder member Ariel Sharon walked out last month , promised to echo the actions of a former prime minister , Menachem Begin , who bombed an Iraqi nuclear facility in 1981 .
"" If [ a pre - emptive strike ] is not done by the present government I intend to lead the next government and to stop this threat , "" he said .
"" I will take every step required to avoid a situation in which Iran can threaten us with nuclear weapons .
"" Iran 's first nuclear reactor at Bushehr is scheduled to start producing power next year .
Two reactors at the site began construction with the help of German engineering giant Siemens in the 1970s , but were never finished and were further damaged during the Iran - Iraq war .
The IAEA has warned Tehran that it would refer the nuclear programme to the UN security council , paving the way for sanctions against the country .
But Saturday 's Guardian Council ruling promised to block international inspections in the event of a security council referral .
Russia 's foreign minister , Sergey Lavrov , today urged Iran to resume cooperation with the IAEA , in a statement on the ministry 's website .
"" A lot will depend on Tehran 's readiness to respond to international concerns and continue cooperation with the agency , "" he wrote .
Russia is a key supporter of Iran 's nuclear intentions , and Mr Lavrov 's warning shot gives hope of a backdown from the current state of brinksmanship over Iran 's nuclear programme ."
2005-12-09,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , reignited the controversy provoked by his recent calls for Israel to be "" wiped off the map "" yesterday by casting doubt on the historical authenticity of the Holocaust and demanding that an alternative Jewish homeland be established in Europe .
In remarks that sparked outrage in Washington and Jerusalem , Mr Ahmadinejad rejected the "" claim "" that millions of Jews were murdered by the Nazis , but called on those who believe to set up a Jewish state in countries such as Germany and Austria .
He told journalists at an international Islamic conference in Mecca : "" Some European countries insist on saying that Hitler killed millions of innocent Jews in furnaces and they insist on it to the extent
that if anyone proves something contrary to that they condemn that person and throw them in jail .
Although we do n't accept this claim , if we suppose it is true , our question for the Europeans is : ' Is the killing of innocent Jewish people by Hitler the reason for their support to the occupiers of Jerusalem ? '
"" If the Europeans are honest they should give some of their provinces in Europe - like in Germany , Austria or other countries - to the Zionists and the Zionists can establish their state in Europe .
You offer part of Europe and we will support it . ""
The comments reinforced Mr Ahmadinejad 's growing international reputation as an implacable enemy of Israel and champion of the views once robustly expressed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini .
Last night an Israeli government spokesman , Raanan Gissin , decried "" the consensus that exists in many circles in the Arab world that the Jewish people ... do not have the right to establish a Jewish , democratic state in their ancestral homeland "" .
He added : "" Just to remind Mr Ahmadinejad , we 've been here long before his ancestors were here . ""
The US state department deplored the Iranian president 's comments as "" appalling and reprehensible "" and the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , called them "" totally unacceptable "" .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's latest outburst comes as European diplomats have been voicing alarm over statements from Iranian officials ahead of the anticipated reopening of long - stalled talks between the EU three - Britain , France and Germany - and Iran over its nuclear programme .
In an unusual move , the British embassy in Tehran yesterday issued a statement accusing the chief Iranian nuclear negotiator , Ali Larijani , of endangering the prospects for a deal after he suggested Iran could soon resume making centrifuges used to produce enriched uranium ."
2005-12-12,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's president , finally cleared an important political hurdle yesterday when MPs approved his fourth choice as oil minister - the plum post in his cabinet .
In an open session of parliament , Kazem Vaziri - Hamaneh was appointed as a compromise figure .
This was a climbdown for Mr Ahmadinejad , who was keen to install his own man in order to further his radical economic agenda of redistributing the formidable oil wealth in one of the world 's biggest crude producers .
The president , who caused international consternation with his calls for Israel to be "" wiped off the map "" , has been stymied at home by opposition from pragmatists in the conservative - dominated parliament , which rejected two of his previous choices of oil minister , calling them inexperienced personal cronies .
A third was forced to withdraw through lack of parliamentary support .
There was further defiance yesterday when MPs demanded the sacking of the defence minister over last week 's crash of a military plane that killed more than 100 people .
A petition called for a formal session to vote on the fate of Muhammad Najjar , one of Mr Ahmadinejad 's less controversial appointments .
Mr Vaziri - Hamaneh was a deputy oil minister under the previous president , Mohammad Khatami .
Yesterday , he called for domestic firms to be favoured over foreign investors , a promise which Mr Ahmadinejad has also made .
The deadlock over the appointment was broken as Tehran 's motorists began a week of enforced restrictions imposed to try to clear a thick pall of smog that has enveloped the city for the past week .
Until Thursday , they will be allowed to take their cars into the capital only on odd or even days , depending on the last digit on their car registration plates .
Authorities were forced last week to close schools and public - sector workplaces after health officials said pollution had reached dangerous levels .
More than 1,100 people have been treated for pollution - related respiratory conditions in recent days , amid unconfirmed reports that scores have died .
Tehran 's streets are regularly clogged with traffic , encouraged by government - subsidised petrol costing less than 20p a gallon .
Many of the city 's estimated 2 million - plus motorists drive outdated vehicles .
For the sixth consecutive day , the Alborz mountains to the north of Iran were obscured by pollution .
In recent days , many citizens have worn face masks after health warnings not to go out unless absolutely necessary ."

The country considers Holocaust denial a criminal offence .
As the controversial British historian and Nazi apologist David Irving is no doubt learning from his prison cell in Vienna , it is a law it is not afraid to prosecute .
He goes on trial in the new year .
Mr Ahmadinejad has produced yet another of his alarmingly frequent comments on Jews and Israel .
First he said Israel should be "" wiped off the map "" , then that Iran did not "" accept this claim "" that Hitler killed millions of Jews .
Today he made a televised speech proclaiming "" they have fabricated a legend under the name ' Massacre of the Jews ' , and they hold it higher than God himself .
"" It goes without saying that if Mr Ahmadinejad ever wanted to visit the International Atomic Energy Agency in its Vienna headquarters to make representations over Iran 's restarted nuclear programme he may be best to do it via a video link .
Four months into office , Mr Ahmadinejad has become a disturbing figure .
In his Guardian column today , Jonathan Freedland writes that he has chosen "" to stand with the cranks , neo - fascists and racists who deny the factual truth of the Holocaust . ""
A recent piece from Newsweek looks at stories circulating in Tehran that the president is obsessed by the return of the Mahdi , the Shia messiah , and felt himself surrounded by a radiant light when he addressed the United Nations .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's rhetoric , it says , is creating "" turmoil "" within Iran 's conservative leadership .
There is incredulity among bloggers about Mr Ahmadinejad 's latest remarks .
Iranian blogger Hossein Derakhshan , known as Hoder , says it is "" now obvious that the new anti - Israeli line of Ahmadinejad and his allies is a change in policy , not a random personal rant "" .
Hoder asks why the change has come about now .
He identifies three reasons : diversion from internal rows and pre - election promises about raising living standards , seeking support for the nuclear programme by being populist , and an attempt to oust moderates .
There are also numerous comments from bloggers in the US and elsewhere .
Some of these latch onto Mr Ahmadinejad 's argument that if the west believed the Holocaust was true , it should accommodate Jews in "" Europe , the US , Canada or Alaska "" not Palestine . ""
Jews in Alaska ?
"" , is a common , disbelieving refrain in bloggers ' postings . ""
Latest Ahmadinejad craziness "" is the headline on the Restless Mania blog .

2005-12-14,"Iran 's president said today that the Holocaust was a "" myth "" , prompting strong condemnation from Israel , Germany and the European Commission .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made the comments to thousands of people during a speech in Iran 's south - eastern city of Zahedan .
They follow the international outcry his remarks caused in October when he said that Israel should be "" wiped off the map "" .
Germany 's foreign minister warned that the "" shocking and unacceptable "" comments would influence coming nuclear talks between Europe and Iran .
The European Commission also said the remarks would hurt Iran 's relations with other countries .
Addressing the crowds in Zahedan , Mr Ahmadinejad said : "" Today , they have created a myth in the name of Holocaust and consider it to be above God , religion and the prophets . ""
He has previously expressed doubts about the murder of the Jews by the Nazis , but today was the first time he said publicly that the Holocaust was a myth .
Speaking as part of a tour of south - east Iran , Mr Ahmadinejad said that if Europeans insisted the Holocaust did happen , then it was they who were responsible and they should pay the price .
"" If you committed this big crime , then why should the oppressed Palestinian nation pay the price ? ""
Mr Ahmadinejad asked .
"" This is our proposal : if you committed the crime , then give a part of your own land in Europe , the United States , Canada or Alaska to them [ Jews ] , so that the Jews can establish their country , "" he said .
These comments developed a theme he first raised in Saudi Arabia last week .
Today in Israel , foreign ministry spokesman Mark Regev said : "" The repeated outrageous remarks of the Iranian president show clearly the mindset of the ruling clique in Tehran and indicate clearly the extremist policy goals of the regime . ""
Referring to allegations that Iran was developing nuclear bombs , Mr Regev went on : "" The combination of fanatical ideology , a warped sense of reality and nuclear weapons is a combination that no one in the international community can accept "" .
Avner Shalev , the director of Yad Vashem , Israel 's memorial to the Holocaust in Jerusalem , said Mr Ahmadinejad 's comments required a "" stronger response from world leaders "" .
Austria 's president , Heinz Fischer , said the remarks were "" unacceptable "" .
In Berlin , the foreign minister , Frank - Walter Steinmeier , said his government had summoned the Iranian charge d'affaires to make "" unmistakably clear "" its displeasure .
"" I can not hide the fact that this weighs on bilateral relations and on the chances for the negotiation process , the so - called nuclear dossier , "" Mr Steinmeier said , referring to European talks with Iran on its nuclear programme .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's views sharply conflict with those of his predecessor , Mohammad Khatami , a moderate who used to call for dialogue among civilisations and promoted a low - key understanding with the United States that stopped short of diplomatic relations .
Within Iran , Mr Ahmadinejad 's remarks have been criticised by some of his conservative allies who fear he is hurting the country 's image .
Moderate Iranians have called on the ruling Islamic establishment to rein in the president .
But Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has the ultimate say , has backed Mr Ahmadinejad 's calls for Israel 's elimination .
Mr Ahmadinejad , a former hardline mayor of Tehran , became president of Iran in August after a surprise election result .
Today , Mr Ahmadinejad also criticised the United States for refusing to sell Iran spare parts for its civilian planes as part of its long - standing embargo against the country .
Iran has suffered a series of plane accidents - most recently on December 6 when an ageing US - made military transport plane crashed into a block of flats in Tehran , killing 115 people .
Iranian officials have blamed Washington for the crashes , saying they are partly caused by the difficulty in obtaining spare parts . ""
No country is authorised to impose spare - part sanctions against another country .
Nothing can justify this , "" Mr Ahmadinejad said ."

2005-12-15,"Iran 's ultra - Islamist president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , triggered a fresh wave of international outrage yesterday by dismissing the Holocaust as a myth and calling for Jews to be moved to Canada and Alaska .
In a speech broadcast live on Iranian television and calculated to generate maximum publicity , Mr Ahmadinejad described the Nazi genocide of 6 million Jews in the second world war as a fabrication concocted to justify Israel 's existence .
"" They have invented a myth that Jews were massacred and place this above God , religions and the prophets , "" he told an audience in the south - eastern city of Zahidan . ""
If someone were to deny the existence of God ... or prophets and religion , they would not bother him .
However , if someone were to deny the myth of the Jews ' massacre , all the Zionist mouthpieces and the governments subservient to the Zionists scream against the person as much as they can .
"" The outburst was the latest in a string of anti - Israeli statements from Mr Ahmadinejad .
Analysts in Tehran yesterday said the wave of rhetoric was calculated to increase Iran 's international isolation , strengthening the president 's radical camp against more pragmatic regime figures who have been critical of his performance since he took office four months ago .
The remarks drew angry condemnation from Israel , the EU and Germany , which warned that they jeopardised the resumption of talks between the EU and Iran about its nuclear programme .
Germany 's foreign minister , Franz - Walter Steinmeier , said : "" I can not hide the fact that this weighs on bilateral relations and on the chances for the negotiation process , the so - called nuclear dossier . ""
One MEP yesterday suggested that the best way to express Europe 's frustration with Mr Ahmadinejad would be to throw Iran out of the World Cup .
Iran , a football - mad country , is due to take part in next summer 's tournament in Germany .
Millions of Iranians watched last week 's draw in Leipzig .
The best way to isolate Iran internationally would be to exclude it from the tournament , Daniel Cohn - Bendit , the joint leader of the Green group in the European parliament , said yesterday .
Last October , Mr Ahmadinejad called for Israel to be "" wiped off the map "" , earning a rebuke from the UN .
Revisiting that theme yesterday , he said : "" If you say it is true that you massacred and burned 6 million Jews during the second world war , if you committed this massacre , why should the Palestinians pay the price ? ...
Give a part of your own land in Europe , the US , Canada or Alaska to them so that the Jews can establish their country . """
2005-12-20,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has banned western music from state radio and TV stations , it was announced today .
In a move reminiscent of the 1979 Islamic revolution , when popular music was outlawed , Mr Ahmadinejad - the head of the Supreme Cultural Revolutionary Council - ordered the implementation of a ruling prohibiting all forms of western music .
It means music including classical compositions will be barred from public service broadcast outlets , local media said .
"" Blocking indecent and western music from the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting is required , "" a statement on the council 's website said .
The move will silence the hip - hop that can frequently be heard blaring from car radios in Tehran 's streets .
It means music including Rush , by Eric Clapton , and Hotel California , by the Eagles , both of which regularly accompany Iranian broadcasts , will be outlawed .
Earlier this month , Ali Rahbari , the conductor of Tehran 's symphony orchestra , resigned and left Iran to protest against the treatment of the music industry the country .
In his farewell concerts , he played Beethoven 's ninth symphony to near sellout crowds over several nights - the work 's first performances in Tehran since 1979 .
The concerts angered many conservatives , prompting newspaper columns that accused Mr Rahbari of promoting western values .
Music was outlawed soon after the 1979 revolution , and many musicians went abroad and built an Iranian music industry in Los Angeles .
However , as revolutionary fervour faded , some light classical music was allowed on Iranian radio and television , and limited public concerts were held in the late 80s .
In the 90s - particularly under the leadership of the reformist president Mohammad Khatami , who came to power in 1997 - authorities began relaxing restrictions further .
Currently , western music , films and clothing are widely available in Iran .
Bootleg videos and DVDs of films banned by the state are on sale on the black market .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's order means the state broadcasting authority must execute the decree and prepare a report on its implementation within six months , according to the IRAN Persian daily .
The ban applies to state - run radio and TV , but it seems Iranians with satellite dishes will still be able to receive broadcasts originating outside the country .
Mr Ahmadinejad took office in August on a platform of reverting to ultra - conservative principles following the eight years of reformist - led rule under Mr Khatami .
Since coming to power , he has caused international concern with his determination to continue Iran 's nuclear weapon programme .
He has also received severe criticism overseas for anti - Jewish and anti - Israeli comments ."
2005-12-20,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's hostile jibes at Israel have caused almost universal offence .
But Iran - watchers are divided over whether the president 's statements mark a dangerous shift in Tehran 's international outlook or form part of an internal power struggle .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's threat "" to wipe Israel off the map "" should be taken seriously , said Martin Indyk , a former US ambassador to Israel working at the Brookings Institution in Washington .
"" Should Israel be satisfied that he scored an own goal , further isolating Iran ? "" he asked .
"" The answer to my mind is clearly no . ""
Mr Indyk said the president 's threats were consistent with a decade - long "" war by proxy "" waged through Hizbullah in Lebanon and Islamic Jihad in Palestine .
Nor was Mr Amadinejad alone in his views .
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader , declared in September that "" jihad is the only way to confront the Zionist enemy "" .
But Iran 's military capacity is limited - and no match for nuclear - armed Israel .
According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies , Iran is developing an upgraded Shahab-3 ballistic missile capable of striking Israel .
Its acquisition of nuclear weapons would radically alter the strategic balance .
But Iran denies any such ambition ; and talks on the issue are due to recommence in Vienna tomorrow .
Despite its anti - western rhetoric , the Islamic republic had no history of state - to - state aggression since the 1979 revolution that overthrew the Shah , a British official noted .
Nor could Mr Ahmadinejad suddenly change its military posture .
"" In Iran 's supreme national security council , he is but one voice among many , "" the official said .
One explanation is that Mr Ahmadinejad , a disciple of the late Ayatollah Khomeini , is trying to resurrect Iran 's role as a revolutionary beacon , uncontaminated by contact with the west . ""
He sees himself as a pan - Islamist leader speaking on behalf of the oppressed Muslim masses everywhere , "" said Karim Sadjadpour , an International Crisis Group analyst .
"" There is intense debate on Iran 's radical right about the extent of any diplomatic accommodation over the nuclear issue .
A younger generation of hardliners to which Ahmadinejad belongs opposes this .
They are opposed by the pragmatists . ""
Perhaps he is trying to curry public support for his position .
But most Iranians will not react favourably .
They see Israel as an Arab issue .
Unemployment and the measures Ahmadinejad promised to improve the economy are what they care about , "" Mr Sadjadpour said .
Ray Takeyh of the US - based Council on Foreign Relations said Mr Ahmadinejad was "" largely indifferent "" to outside world opinion .
But Iran could not afford to abandon its post - Khomeini efforts to open up to foreign trade and investment , particularly in the energy sector .
Key partners Russia and China joined the criticism of his anti - Israel statements .
"" What he said about Israel delighted the American neo - cons , it delighted our Arab rivals , it delighted the Israelis ...
But it was totally against Iran 's national interest , "" an informed Iranian source said .
But US hostility was partly responsible for Mr Ahmadinejad 's rise .
"" Your hardliners have created our hardliner . ""
By claiming ( like George Bush ) to be on a mission from God and by predicting the second coming of the Twelfth Imam , Mr Ahmadinejad has shocked some observers .
Charles Krauthammer , a conservative American columnist , called him a "" certifiable lunatic "" .
But the most likely rational explanation for his behaviour was domestic political weakness , the British official said .
His bid to purify the revolution had stirred up stiff opposition from old guard conservatives , reformists ( who call his policies delusional ) and corrupt "" clerical oligarchs "" who run the powerful bonyads - lucrative semi - official business enterprises which Mr Ahmadinejad wants to rein in .
Mr Ahmadinejad was trying "" to be more religious than the mullahs "" , the official said .
"" But he is very naive .
He has thrown away a lot of support by not delivering on his promises to ordinary people .
This is all about internal dynamics .
It 's not Iran versus the west , it 's Iran versus Iran .
And the more it goes on , the more likely the whole awful regime will come crashing down . """
2005-12-21,"Having outraged the international community by denying the holocaust and Israel 's right to exist , Iran 's combative president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has launched an offensive against new western targets - George Michael , Eric Clapton and the Bee Gees .
In a decree that threatens to turn the clock back to 1979 , when Iran was gripped by the Islamic revolution , Mr Ahmadinejad has ordered state broadcasters to stop playing "" decadent "" western music and to favour "" fine Iranian music "" instead .
The order , issued by the high council of cultural revolution , which the president heads , is the strongest signal yet that Mr Ahmadinejad intends to match his ideological rhetoric with a cultural and social crackdown .
It follows a ban on western films on television and will increase fears that Iran is entering a new era of isolationism when international suspicions are high over its nuclear programme .
The ban will affect an eclectic swath of western artists , including George Michael , Eric Clapton and the Bee Gees , whose songs are frequently heard on national television and radio .
Instrumental versions of Michael 's Careless Whisper , Clapton 's Rush and the Bee Gees ' How Deep Is Your Love are commonly broadcast as accompaniment to a range of Iranian programming . ""
The promotion of decadent and western music should be avoided and the stress put on authorised , artistic , classic and fine Iranian music , "" the decree states .
It urges broadcasters to play "" relaxing themes and memorable music from the revolution "" .
The order could herald the reversal of a cultural thaw begun under the previous reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami , in which CDs by bands and artists such as Pink Floyd , David Bowie and Radiohead sold in Iranian music stores .
Mr Ahmadinejad , an Islamist hardliner , promised to re - establish "" Qur'anic "" cultural values before he unexpectedly won last June 's presidential election .
In the early years of Iran 's Islamic regime , all music apart from revolutionary themes was banned on the order of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , spiritual leader of the revolution .
That led to the exodus of popular Iranian musicians to the US , where many still record .
Their songs continued to be widely played in Iran .
The purge against western music could be extended to public performances .
Under Mr Khatami , a limited number of live rock and pop concerts were allowed with the permission of the culture and Islamic guidance ministry .
However , the ministry is now controlled by Mr Ahmadinejad 's appointees ."
2006-01-11,"Iran 's hardline president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has been spoiling for a fight since he was elected last summer .
Now it looks as though he has got one , as the US , Britain and EU allies prepared yesterday to refer Iran 's nuclear activities to the UN security council for possible punitive sanctions .
The escalating dispute confronts the international community with potentially its biggest challenge since the Iraq war .
It resurrects a range of divisive issues , such as the true extent of the global WMD threat , the difficulty of pursuing joint action via the UN , the willingness of the new superpower , China , to play by western rules , and perceived double standards over the nuclear non - proliferation treaty ( NPT ) .
Mohamed ElBaradei , the usually cool - headed boss of the UN 's nuclear watchdog , said that by resuming nuclear fuel research at its Natanz facility in defiance of previous agreements , Tehran could have crossed a "" red line "" that made a tough response inevitable .
"" We are at a stage where what is happening this week could turn into a major crisis , "" he told the BBC .
But the handling of that crisis , should it materialise , could severely test the cohesiveness of the collective international will , as Condoleezza Rice , the US secretary of state , seemed to acknowledge last week .
Washington was accused last year of undermining EU negotiating efforts .
But that had changed , she said .
"" The first goal was to get a unified position and that had to do with giving diplomacy a chance .
We 've lived up to our part of the bargain .
The Europeans and we could not be in closer coordination .
"" The next steps have been to bring others into that consensus : Russia , India , China .
So I think you are seeing the consistent and sort of seriatim isolation now of Iran .
I do n't have any doubt that at a time of our choosing we 're going to go to the security council . ""
A Downing Street statement yesterday asserting that the world was "" running out of patience "" with Iran apparently sought to reinforce the impression of a united front .
But chinks were apparent within hours of Iran 's move .
Looking to cool diplomatic temperatures , China urged the EU not to abandon talks with Tehran ( as Germany has suggested it might ) .
Beijing said it still believed the issue could be resolved without recourse to the security council .
Russia was similarly circumspect .
While expressing concern , a senior official said Moscow 's offer to enrich uranium on Russian soil and ship low - grade nuclear fuel back to Iran still stood following "" professional and honest "" talks in Tehran .
Moscow and Beijing have significant commercial ties with Iran that they would not want jeopardised by sanctions .
Dr ElBaradei 's confirmation that Iran , which denies seeking a nuclear weapons capability , was acting within its legal rights under the NPT represents another obstacle to a common front .
The failure of nuclear - armed states , notably the US , to reduce their arsenals in line with NPT provisions is controversial in developing countries and especially in the Muslim world , where there is sneaking sympathy for Iran .
If it comes to a crunch at the UN , Mr Ahmadinejad may be far from dismayed or deterred .
Informed Iranian sources say he has deliberately sought confrontation with the west ( and particularly Israel ) to strengthen his position and advance his "" revivalist revolutionary "" policies at home and in the region .
While any UN sanctions may have limited economic impact , a high - profile political showdown may serve his purposes ."
2006-01-11,"The prime minister said today that it was "" likely "" that the UK , the US and European allies would seek to refer Iran to the United Nations security council over its nuclear programme .
Tony Blair spoke in the Commons of his "" deep dismay "" over Tehran 's decision to break the UN seals at its nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz and refused to rule out seeking sanctions .
But in a televised speech today the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , was defiant despite the international outcry .
He said Iran was not frightened by threats from superpowers and would press ahead with its nuclear programme .
Last night the White House said Iran risked a "" serious escalation "" in the crisis over its nuclear ambitions after it emerged that the seals had been broken , reneging on earlier commitments to freeze research .
Iran has said it has a right to carry out research and ultimately enrich its own nuclear material , which it insists is solely to create power for civilian use .
The US is suspicious that Tehran wants to create atomic weapons , which can be made by a higher level of enrichment than that used for nuclear power .
In the Commons during question time , Mr Blair told the Conservative leader , David Cameron , that Iran 's decision to push ahead with its nuclear research was "" very serious indeed "" .
"" I do not think there is any point in people , or us , hiding our deep dismay at what Iran has decided to do . ""
Mr Cameron asked Mr Blair what steps he was proposing to "" maximise the international consensus "" for referral to the UN and what the prospects were for international sanctions .
Mr Blair said : "" Obviously we do n't rule out any measures at all .
It 's important Iran recognises how seriously the international community treats it .
""
The foreign secretary , Jack Straw , will meet his counterparts from France and Germany in Berlin tomorrow for emergency talks over Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
The three countries - the so - called EU3 - have spent two years trying to persuade Iran to halt its uranium conversion and enrichment activities .
The Italian foreign minister , Gianfranco Fini , said today that the international community had entered a "" new phase "" in its relations with Iran .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's remarks indicated that the standoff over its nuclear plans was as firm as ever .
Speaking on a visit to the port city of Bandar Abbas , Mr Ahmadinejad said : "" I tell those superpowers that , with strength and prudence , Iran will pave the way to achieving peaceful nuclear energy .
The Iranian nation is not frightened by the powers and their noise ... in the near future , [ nuclear ] energy will be completely carried out by the Iranian nation . ""
He accused the west of using fears of nuclear weapons as an excuse to prevent Iran 's technological development and to control the country by forcing it to buy nuclear fuel abroad .
"" They falsely say that they oppose nuclear weapons .
They want to have nuclear monopoly to sell it drop by drop in an expensive price and use it as an instrument for domination over nations . ""
In the Commons , Mr Blair said anxieties about Iran had been compounded by recent comments made by the Mr Ahmadinejad about Israel .
Mr Ahmadinejad has denied the Holocaust and called for Israel to be "" wiped off the map "" .
Such statements indicated a "" malign intention on the part of the Iranian regime "" , Mr Blair said , adding that there was "" real and serious alarm right across the world "" about Iran .
The prime minister told MPs : "" We obviously are discussing this closely , as well , with our American allies . ""
A reference to the security council is entirely in line with what the [ International ] Atomic Energy Authority itself decided some time ago , when the only reason it suspended a reference to the security council was because Iran had suspended its enrichment facilities . ""
This is why it is extremely important we take a fresh look at this now . """
2006-01-15,"It was not the most diplomatic of diplomatic encounters .
High above New York , on the 38th floor of the United Nations headquarters , five men and a clutch of aides and interpreters were having a tense meeting .
One was Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the new President of Iran .
Speaking quietly but very firmly , the diminutive 49-year - old , dressed , as always , in his suit and open - necked shirt , made little secret of his contempt for his interlocutors . '
Do not dare to threaten us with sanctions or you will regret it , ' he said . '
You just do what your American masters tell you to do . '
Ahmadinejad was addressing the Foreign Ministers of Britain , France and Germany .
Joschka Fischer , the German Foreign Minister , responded first . '
That is completely untrue and you do not have the right to say that , ' he said . '
Mr President , it is very evident that you are new to this dossier .
I have worked on it for three years and I can tell you that you are mistaken . '
Philippe Douste - Blazy , the urbane French Foreign Minister , spoke next . '
We do not have confidence in you , ' he told the Iranian President . '
So I should leave now ? ' came the response . '
No , ' said Douste - Blazy , ' but you must know that first this is all about confidence . '
The meeting , in the office of Kofi Annan in mid - September , on the sidelines of the UN summit , was supposed to be a chance for reconciliation .
Despite relatively emollient words on his election three months earlier , Ahmadinejad 's intention to press ahead with Iran 's nuclear programme had soon become clear .
He pledged publicly , and without a shred of concern at international repercussions , that his nation would renew its attempts to enrich uranium .
The meeting was aimed at bringing Ahmadinejad back into line .
Instead , it left the Europeans stunned . '
No one could quite believe what had just happened , ' one official said . '
All the rules that we had been playing to - and have been playing to for years - had been overturned .
He was just not speaking our language .
It was as if he had just walked in from the boondocks covered in dust . '
In fact , Ahmadinejad comes from a town not far from Tehran .
Born in 1956 , the son of a blacksmith with seven children , Ahmadinejad came 130th in nationwide exams and won a place at the prestigious University of Science and Technology in the capital to study engineering .
It was the early Seventies and all over the Islamic world , university campuses were seething with political unrest , pitting religious radicals against secular leftist extremists .
Iran was no different and Ahmadinejad swiftly became active in underground , radical , religious - based political movements .
He studied hard , completing a PhD in engineering and traffic transportation planning .
When the revolution against the repressive regime of the Shah finally came in 1979 , Ahmadinejad was already a well - known figure in one of the harder - line student groups and took part in the vicious struggle to establish the dominance of the Islamists over the leftists following the Shah 's fall .
He was also , at least marginally , involved in the seizure of hostages at the American embassy .
Though alleged to be one of the instigators , he actually did little more than recommend that Soviet hostages were seized too , revealing both a zealotry and a naivety that would not diminish much over the coming decades .
In the early Eighties , Ahmadinejad left an academic career to fight in the carnage of the Iran - Iraq war , apparently leading operations behind enemy lines .
In 1986 , he joined the Revolutionary Guards , the militia created by Ayatollah Khomeini to balance the power of the Iranian army .
Based near Kermanshah , Ahmadinejad directed a squad specialising in the assassination of ' enemies of the revolution ' .
He was , according to those who came across him at the time , committed , brutal , extremely effective .
He may have participated in secret missions overseas , such as the assassination of a Kurdish dissident in Vienna .
If he did , these journeys are likely to have been his only trips abroad before becoming President .
With the war against Iraq over , Ahmadinejad turned to politics .
After two stints as a mayor , he became governor of Ardabil province in 1994 .
His new career received a temporary check three years later when a reforming moderate cleric , Mohammed Khatami , won presidential elections and effectively banished the hardline junior politician back to academia .
Ahmadinejad put his time to good use , lecturing and running a radical fundamentalist militia called the Ansar - e Hizbollah ( Brotherhood of the Party of God ) .
Increasingly seen as a potential leader by one of the various factions of conservatives within Iran , he was put forward as a potential mayor of Tehran and , in 2003 , was elected , on a 12 per cent turn out , to the top job in the capital .
His pitch was simple .
He was honest , poor , hardworking and devout and , as such , different from virtually every other Iranian politician .
His rhetoric appealed to all those millions of people who had gained little under six years of a ' reforming ' administration .
And Ahmadinejad did not , at least superficially , disappoint .
He turned up at the town hall with his lunch in a paper bag and ate it in his office .
He spent a day with the town 's road sweepers .
All the creeping liberalisation of the wealthy , Westernised suburbs of the north of the capital - a stark contrast to the conservative , pious , poor , working - class quarters - was reversed .
The new burger joints were shut down and the posters of British footballers disappeared .
So , too , did hand - holding couples , many of the internet cafes and the heavily made - up girls .
Last year came the opportunity that Ahmadinejad and his backers had been waiting for .
At the beginning of the campaign for the presidency , Ahmadinejad was the least known of the seven candidates standing .
Yet his image as the little man of the people , his straight talking and his lack of style and pretension was a stark contrast to the wealth , power and alleged corruption of the favourite , the former President , Ali Akbar Rafsanjani .
Though he refused to spend a penny on his campaign , Ahmadinejad 's simple message of a return to austerity , honesty , ' family values ' and national and religious pride found an echo among the essentially conservative , and poorly educated , rural and urban working classes .
The mobilisation of the mosques did the rest and Ahmadinejad won with almost two- thirds of votes cast .
Despite allegations of fraud , his victory stood .
For Iran watchers in the West , Ahmadinejad had come straight from nowhere .
And since taking power , he has apparently gone out of his way to shock and outrage the West .
Israel should be wiped from the map ; the Holocaust is a myth ; Iran has an inalienable right to nuclear weapons .
If it was not so dangerous , said one Whitehall official last week , it would be tempting to dismiss Ahmadinejad as ' a loony tune ' .
Unfortunately , no one can .
One difficulty is that Ahmadinejad is not some kind of ' mad mullah ' trying to return Iran to the middle ages .
He is a thoroughly modern man , married to a university lecturer and keen on modern technology .
He is motivated by a profound desire not to reject or destroy the technology and thought that underpins the West 's power but to appropriate and exploit it .
The problem for the West as they try , like a wrestler grappling an oiled opponent , to find someway of engaging with Ahmadinejad , is that few really know what they are up against .
For some , Ahmadinejad is a puppet manipulated by conservative factions .
For others , he is a religious fanatic devoted to a bizarre strand of Shia Islam .
In fact , there is a simpler way to understand Ahmadinejad , though it is not a reassuring one .
Ahmadinejad is a man who says the truth as it is perceived by tens of millions of people in Iran and hundreds of millions more in the Islamic world .
When he spouts vile anti - semitism or Holocaust denial , he is merely saying what governments elsewhere in the region have been saying privately , or allowing state - owned media to say domestically , for decades .
When he calls for honesty , efficiency and ' religious values ' in administration , his words have a resonance across the Middle East .
When he speaks of how the ' neo - imperial ' West wants to deny the Islamic world nuclear technology to maintain its own economic superiority , he is merely stating what is a given in coffee shops from Algiers to Islamabad .
When he tells major powers not to threaten him , he is saying what huge numbers of people , all full of a bitter sense of humiliation at the faults , flaws , lacks and defeats of their own nations and societies , would want him to say .
Much of his rhetoric is local , his language saturated with Iranian nationalism , but Ahmadinejad has his finger on a bigger pulse than that merely of the working - class suburbs of Tehran .
He is a politician , and a good if unskilled and instinctive one at that , but he is the son of a blacksmith , too , and that may be , not a weakness , but his greatest , and most frightening , strength .

2006-01-15,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the hardline President of Iran , launched an angry tirade against the West yesterday , accusing it of a ' dark ages ' mentality and threatening retaliation unless it recognised his country 's nuclear ambitions .
In a blistering assault , Ahmadinejad repeated the Islamic regime 's position that it would press ahead with a nuclear programme despite threats by the European Union and United States to refer Iran to the UN Security Council , where it could face possible sanctions .
He added that Iran was a ' civilised nation ' that did not need such weapons .
Iran insists its nuclear programme is a wholly peaceful attempt to generate electricity .
Addressing a rare press conference in Tehran , he appeared to issue thinly veiled threats against Western countries , implying that they could face serious consequences unless they backed down . '
You need us more than we need you .
All of you today need the Iranian nation , ' Ahmadinejad said .
' Why are you putting on airs ?
You do n't have that might . '
Reminding the West that it had supported the monarchical regime of the former Shah , Mohammed Reza Pahlavi - overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution - he went on : ' Those same powers have done their utmost to oppress us , but this nation , because of its dignity , has forgiven them to a large extent .
But if they persist with their present stance , maybe the day will come when the Iranian nation will reconsider . '
He added : ' If they want to deny us our rights , we have ways to secure those rights . '
Ahmadinejad , an ultra - Islamist populist elected last June , did not elaborate on his apparent threat .
But Iran is the world 's fourth - largest oil producer and analysts have predicted that any disruption to its supplies could have a grave impact on global markets .
The Iranian President 's outburst - the latest in a series asserting Iran 's nuclear rights and questioning Israel 's right to exist - came after the EU last week effectively abandoned two - and - a - half years of negotiations with the Iranians .
The move came after Iran decided to remove UN seals at a nuclear plant in Natanz , enabling it to resume research into uranium enrichment , a process that can be used to produce a nuclear weapon .
The EU , backed by the United States , is calling for an emergency meeting of the UN 's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , to discuss Iran 's possible referral to the security council .
The next phase of the intensifying diplomatic pressure on Iran takes place in London tomorrow when officials from the EU , US , Russia and China gather to discuss future strategy .
Ahmadinejad accused the West of misusing bodies such as the UN and IAEA . '
Why are you damaging the good name of the security council and IAEA for you own political purposes ? '
he asked . '
Do n't take away the credibility of legitimate forums .
Your arsenals are full to the brim , yet when it 's the turn of a nation such as mine to develop peaceful nuclear technology you object and resort to threats . '
In an apparent effort to cast the nuclear issue as one that could unite all Iranians and appeal to nationalist sentiment , Ahmadinejad spoke against the backdrop of a picture of the Damavand volcano , widely seen as a patriotic , non - religious symbol .
But he did not withdraw his remarks , warning that Bush and German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who on Friday condemned his comments as ' unacceptable ' , would be tried as ' terrorists ' and ' war criminals ' due to their support of Israel .
German Deputy Foreign Minister Gernot Erler yesterday called for travel restrictions on Iran 's politicians .
He told German radio that economic sanctions would be ' a very dangerous path ' and could hurt both sides .

2006-01-16,"CNN has reportedly been barred from working in Iran after misquoting president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as saying his country was entitled to "" nuclear weapons "" .
CNN apologised after misquoting the country 's president during a live broadcast , reporting him as saying "" the use of nuclear weapons is Iran 's right "" .
In fact , the broadcaster said today , Mr Ahmadinejad had referred to "" nuclear energy "" . ""
Due to an error in translation , CNN incorrectly quoted Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , in his speech given on Saturday , as saying that Iran has the right to build nuclear weapons .

CNN takes this matter very serious and apologises for the error , "" the broadcaster said .
CNN said it had apologised to the Iranian government as well as running corrections on air .
But according to reports , the Iranian authorities have now banned CNN and expelled its reporter from the country .
"" Taking into account CNN 's actions contrary to professional ethics in the past years and their distortion of the president 's comments during his press conference on Saturday , the activities of the CNN journalist in Tehran will end and no journalists from CNN will be authorised to come to Iran , "" according to a statement from the Iranian culture ministry , quoted by news agency AFP .

2006-01-16,"Iran announced yesterday it would stage a conference to question the authenticity of the Holocaust , a move certain to stir international anger .
The statement follows a series of inflammatory remarks by Iran 's hawkish president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who has described the murder of six million Jews by the Nazis in the second world war as a myth and called for Israel to be "" wiped off the map "" .
He has also suggested an alternative Jewish state should be set up in Europe or Alaska .
An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman said the proposed conference would examine the Holocaust 's "" scientific aspects and its repercussions "" .
The description echoes Mr Ahmadinejad 's characterisation of Holocaust denial earlier this month as a "" scientific debate "" .
It is not clear who will attend .
But following a chorus of anti - Zionist rhetoric since the president was elected last June , the announcement will trigger suspicions that the aim is to deny that the Holocaust happened .
Last month , Mr Ahmadinejad dismissed it as a concoction invented to justify Israel 's existence in the heart of the Muslim world .
His comments drew widespread condemnation .
At a meeting with President George Bush last week , the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , described Mr Ahmadinejad 's position on the Holocaust as unacceptable .
At a rare news conference on Saturday , however , the Iranian president was unrepentant .
He described Mrs Merkel and Mr Bush as terrorists and war criminals , who would soon be put on trial for their support of Israel .
Describing the Holocaust as a question that had to be cleared up by scholars , he added : "" My question was very clear .
On the pretext of the killing of Jews in Europe , are they supporting the aggression and massacres [ of Israel ] ?
They will not intimidate me .
Instead they have to answer me .
If you started this killing of the Jews , you have to make amends yourself .
This is very clear .
It 's based on laws and legal considerations .
If you committed a mistake or a crime , why should others pay for it ?
Those who murdered [ the Jews ] should permit them to go back to their own fatherlands .
That should be the end of it .
You should n't say that nobody is permitted to say anything about this . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad initially provoked an international storm by calling for Israel 's removal for the map last October .
His remarks repeated what had been official Iranian policy since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
Support for the Palestinian cause is a central pillar in the ideology of Iran 's Islamic regime , which regards Israel 's existence as an affront to Muslims .
However , Mr Ahmadinejad has surpassed previous Iranian leaders in consistently attacking what he sees as the intellectual and moral basis for Israel 's existence .
Under his more liberal predecessor , Mohammad Khatami , anti - Zionist rhetoric was toned down .
Iranian officials said they would respect a Middle East peace settlement as long as it was acceptable to the Palestinians .

However , deniers claim that Jewish deaths during the war were not caused by genocide .
The most prominent denier of recent years is historian David Irving , in custody in Austria , where Holocaust denial is illegal .
Mohammed Mahdi Akef , leader of Egypt 's Muslim Brotherhood , has also called the Holocaust a ' myth ' .

2006-01-17,"Iran today lifted its ban on CNN , a day after the government barred the US television network from the country because of its mistranslation of nuclear comments by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , state television reported .
President Ahmadinejad ordered the reversal "" due to the expression of an apology "" from CNN over the mistranslation , the state - run TV broadcaster said .
Iran imposed the ban yesterday after CNN misquoted the president as speaking of "" nuclear weapons "" when he actually referred to "" nuclear technology . ""
CNN admitted the mistake in a broadcast .
However , hardliners in the country called the mistranslation a "" deliberate "" act by the American broadcaster to misrepresent Iran 's position at a crucial moment in international negotiations .
The move highlighted the continuing tension between Iran and the west over Tehran 's nuclear programme .
The Jomhuri - e - Eslami newspaper today accused CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour of being a "" CIA and Mossad agent with a bad record "" who should be barred from Iran .
In the Kayhan newspaper , the prominent hardliner Hossein Shariatmadari wrote that the chances of the mistranslation having been an accident were "" close to nil "" . ""
The distortion was deliberate with the aim of preventing the impact of president 's comments on the public opinion , "" Shariatmadari wrote .

2006-01-18,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the president of Iran , issued a reminder on Saturday that the west 's dependence on imported oil meant : "" You need us more than we need you .
"" Iran 's ambitions to develop nuclear power for civilian use are often derided because it is the world 's fourth largest oil exporter .
But oil is a finite resource and the development of alternative energy sources is a legitimate concern for all nations .
Tony Blair has signalled that he is in favour of developing a new generation of nuclear power stations to meet Britain 's energy gap .
He is also in favour of developing a new generation of nuclear weapons - the rationale being that although the UK has no nuclear - armed enemies at present , we may have in the future .
There is little reason to trust the Iranian government and one might infer that it is developing nuclear weapons to deter attacks from its nuclear - armed enemies , Israel and the US .
But is it not disingenuous for the UK to attack Iran for employing the same logic to the problems of energy and defence as we do ?
The Iranian crisis is part of a wider , global crisis : the end of the cheap oil era .
We are at a historical cross roads - one path leads to an era of nuclear proliferation , resource wars and possible systemic collapse ; the other demands a massive commitment to developing renewable energy resources , nuclear disarmament and positive systemic change .
Dan Welch Manchester Recent reports that Iran plans to resume research into uranium enrichment have raised fears that the technology may not be used purely for nuclear electricity .
But Europe and the US could call the bluff of the Iranians by offering to build enough concentrating solar power plants to supply all of the country 's needs .
Iran has enormous quantities of energy falling as sunlight on to its deserts and CSP is a proven technology for tapping into this vast resource ( see , for example , www.eere.energy.gov/solar/csp.html . )
In one of the simplest of several variations , an array of mirrors focuses sunlight on to a tank filled with water mounted on a low tower .
This raises steam that can be used to generate electricity and there are techniques for storing solar heat so that generation of electricity can continue at night .
Even if the bluff were accepted , it would be an inexpensive way to reduce worries about the proliferation of nuclear weapons .
Gerry Wolff Anglesey To the north of Iran lies Russia , an expansionist nuclear state that has invaded Muslim Chechnya .
To the west is Iraq which invaded Iran in the 1980s and is now occupied by two nuclear - armed powers , Britain and the US .
Also to the west lies Israel , another nuclear power .
Although President Ahmadinejad 's latest statement makes it clear that his country has no desire to develop nuclear weapons , the case for Iran to have an independent nuclear deterrent is far stronger than that for the possession of nuclear weapons by the UK .
Yusuf Rakeem Bristol You are correct in stating ( Tangling with Tehran , January 12 ) that Iran is prohibited from developing nuclear weapons under the nuclear non - proliferation treaty .
What you do not mention is that the British government is intent upon its own breach of the NPT : a replacement for the Trident nuclear weapons system .
In terms of world safety , Iran should not pursue nuclear weapons - but it is double - standards for Britain to flout the NPT while escalating tensions with Iran on the suspicion that it might be intending to do so .
It is now crucial that existing nuclear states move towards genuine disarmament talks in compliance with the NPT .
Kate Hudson Chair , Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament
Jack Straw has said that Iran has a history of concealment and deception .
That 's a bit rich from a member of a government that will not let the public see the legal advice on which it went to war with Iraq , and that pretended Iraq had WMDs when it knew it did n't .

2006-01-19,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , arrived in Damascus today for a two - day visit to Syria .
Bilateral economic , industrial and cultural agreements are scheduled for talks between Mr Ahmadinejad and his Syrian counterpart , Bashar al - Assad , and with both leaders under pressure and isolated from the international community , they are also expected to discuss relations with the wider world .
Iran is facing calls from Brussels and Washington to be referred to the UN security council over its nuclear programme , while a UN investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri has pointed the finger at Syria .
Investigators want to interview Mr Assad and his foreign minister , Farouq al - Shara .
Damascus denies any role in the killing but says it will not allow the president to be questioned .
Mr Ahmadinejad , who is making his fourth foreign trip since becoming president , said relations with Syria , Iran 's closest Arab ally , were "" strong and good "" .
Mr Assad was the first foreign leader to visit him when he took office in August .
The two countries share similar foreign policy objectives : opposition to what they perceive as US attempts to dominate the Middle East , hostility toward Israel and support for Palestinian and Lebanese militant groups .
The US lists both countries as sponsors of terrorism .
Syria has a seat on the 35-nation board of the UN 's International Atomic Energy Agency , which holds an emergency meeting on February 2 to consider EU calls to refer Iran to the security council after it removed UN seals on three nuclear research facilities .
The Europeans , backed by the Washington , are confident of securing a majority , but there are countries whose vote they can not count on .
A Syrian vote against the EU call could bolster Belarus , Cuba and Venezuela to vote with them and perhaps swing Algeria and Libya .
Iran denies that it has a covert nuclear weapons programme ."
2006-01-25,"Eight Iranians were killed and dozens injured by two bombs in Ahvaz , on the day President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had been due to visit the south - western city .
The blasts , in a bank and a government building , were the latest outbreak of violence to strike the ethnically sensitive city , which has a majority Arab population .
Officials said Mr Ahmadinejad had called off his trip because of bad weather , but there was speculation that the cancellation was due to intelligence warnings of an imminent attack .
The Lebanese television channel al - Manar - run by the pro - Iranian Shia group Hizbullah - reported that the attacks were an assassination attempt on Mr Ahmadinejad , but Iranian officials dismissed the suggestion . ""
The place where the bombs exploded was a long way from where the president had planned to make a speech , "" said the Ahvaz governor , Muhammad Jafar Samari .
One explosion tore through the Saman bank at around 10 am , when some 60 people were inside , causing the ceiling to collapse .
The second blast hit the local headquarters of the state - run centre for natural resources and was said to have been triggered by a device planted in a machine room .
Several survivors had to have limbs amputated , doctors said .
There was no claim of responsibility , but several MPs in Iran 's conservative - dominated parliament blamed the blasts on Arab separatists whom they claimed are backed by foreign powers .
"" Those behind the explosions are dependent on counter - revolutionary currents and influenced by foreign elements , "" Hamid Zanganeh , MP for Ahvaz , told the Mehr news agency .
"" They were trying to use the president 's planned visit to expose Iran 's internal situation as unpeaceful and unstable . ""
In October officials , including Mr Ahmadinejad , blamed the UK for two blasts that killed seven in Ahvaz .
No evidence was presented .
Britain denied the claim .
In June , four explosions within 24 hours killed seven people in the city , just days before Iran 's presidential election .
The blasts followed the deaths in April of at least five people in clashes with security forces after demonstrations triggered by claims of discrimination from the local Arab population ."
2006-01-26,"Iran 's president and foreign minister yesterday blamed Britain and the US for bombings that killed at least nine people in the south - western city of Ahvaz , capital of oil - rich Khuzestan province bordering Iraq .
"" Traces of the occupiers of Iraq are evident in the Ahvaz events .
They should take responsibility in this regard , "" state TV quoted President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as saying .
Some 46 people were also wounded in the explosions on Tuesday at a bank and an environmental agency building .
No evidence has been presented to support the claims of UK or American involvement ."
2006-01-29,"Senior Iranian officials further raised tensions with the West yesterday , implicitly warning that Tehran would use missiles to strike Israel or Western forces stationed in the Gulf if attacked .
The statements came as world leaders met at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos , with the Middle East high on the agenda .
The hardline Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has pressed ahead with a controversial nuclear programme since his election last year . '
The world knows Iran has a ballistic missile power with a range of 2,000 km ( 1,300 miles ) , ' General Yahya Rahim Safavi said on state - run television . '
We have no intention to invade any country [ but ] we will take effective defence measures if attacked . '
Though world leaders agreed that strong measures were necessary to prevent Iran gaining nuclear weapon capacity , there was little consensus this weekend as to what those measures should be .
Jack Straw , the Foreign Secretary , yesterday conceded that Britain and the US were divided over using military force .
Responding to comments by US politicians stressing the ' leverage ' the military option allowed , Straw said such action was not under discussion . '
I understand that 's the American position .
Our position is different ...
There is n't a military option .
And no one is talking about it . '
Britain , along with most EU states , has been pursuing a policy of ' engagement ' with the Iranians .
Straw was speaking ahead of talks with Mohamed ElBaradei , the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Tehran 's continuing defiance of the international pressure has led to growing pressure to refer Iran to the UN security council .
Such calls became more urgent after Iran said it was resuming work at its Natanz uranium enrichment facility .
Tehran has always said the facility is to provide energy but Straw said there had to be ' objective guarantees ' that their nuclear power programme could not lead to a nuclear weapons capability because of their ' unquestionable record of deceit in the past ' .
Moscow has suggested that uranium for Iranian reactors could be prepared in Russia , a process that would in theory ensure that the fuel is not enriched to a level that would permit military use .
Tehran claims its nuclear programme is designed only for civilian purposes .
Britain is expected to lead calls for UN censure of Iran at an emergency meeting in Vienna this week .
The UK is backed by France , Germany and the US .
Iran has sought to split the international community , offering economic incentives to India , China and Russia , all of which have strong commercial links with the oil - rich state .
For the moment , Iran 's most powerful weapon is the Shahab-3 missile , which can strike more than 2,000 km from their launch site , putting Israel and American forces in the Middle East in easy range .
The Revolutionary Guard was equipped with the missiles in July 2003 . '
We are producing these missiles and do n't need foreign technology for that , ' Safavi said pointedly in his speech to the nation .
Iran announced last year that it had developed solid - fuel technology for missiles , a major breakthrough that increases their accuracy .
Safavi also accused US and British intelligence services of provoking unrest in south - west Iran and providing bomb materials to Iranian dissidents .
He said the US and Britain were behind bombings on 21January that killed at least nine people in Ahvaz , near the southern border with Iraq , where 8,500 British soldiers are based around Basra . '
Foreign forces based in Iraq , especially southern Iraq , direct Iranian agents and give them bomb materials , ' he said .
Iran was monitoring dissidents and their alleged links with the US and British forces . '
We are aware of their meetings in Kuwait and Iraq , ' he said .
' We warn them [ the US and Britain ] , especially the MI6 and CIA , that they refrain from interfering in Iran 's affairs . '"
2006-01-29,"Oil markets are braced for a nail - biting week , as world leaders demand action against Iran over its nuclear ambitions , and analysts warn that crude prices could reach $ 90 a barrel if the oil - rich state retaliates by blocking supplies .
The International Atomic Energy Agency meets on Thursday to decide whether to refer Iran to the United Nations Security Council .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's president , has threatened to respond to any punitive action by cutting off the 2.6 million barrels of oil a day it pumps into the markets - 5 per cent of the world 's supply .
Jittery investors sent the price of Brent crude to $ 67.76 a barrel in New York on Friday night , as fears about the Iranian crisis and rebel attacks on oil facilities in Nigeria rocked confidence in an already tight market .
Kona Haque , commodities editor at the Economist Intelligence Unit , said the worst case scenario of a shutdown of supplies from Iran would be ' absolutely devastating ...
I would n't be surprised to see the price go over $ 90 a barrel ' .
She said fears about Iran are already adding a $ 10 risk premium to oil prices , which could remain in place for months as the crisis escalates .
Davoud Danesh - Jafari , Iran 's oil minister , has warned that the result of punitive action against his country would be ' the unleashing of a crisis in the oil sector ' . '
The resumption of nuclear research by Iran is currently the market 's largest preoccupation , ' said BNP Paribas oil analyst Eoin O'Callaghan .
He has pushed up his forecast for average oil prices this year to $ 65 a barrel because of geopolitical risk .
He points out that the oil price rose more than 60 per cent in the run - up to the Iraq war ; a similar increase now would take prices to $ 94 .
Haque said that with little spare capacity in the market , prices are much more vulnerable to political shocks : ' We need a lot more supply capacity to have a cushion ; it 's going to take another couple of years until that happens . '
The oil producers ' organisation Opec meets in Vienna on Tuesday amid calls from some members , including Iran , to cut back production and push up prices further .
But most analysts believe production quotas will be left unchanged . '
There 's no pressure on Opec to do anything , ' said Rob Laughlin , oil analyst at Man Financial .
He said the Nigerian situation could potentially be worse for oil prices than fears about a supply squeeze from Iran .
Production levels in Nigeria have already been lowered by 200,000 barrels a day in an effort to protect facilities from the rebels , who have deliberately targeted foreign oil companies . '
Nigeria is probably as big a problem as Iran for us .
We 're pretty politically squeezed , between the Nigerian rebels and the Iranian president , ' said Laughlin .
The president of Opec , Nigeria 's Edmund Daukoru , fuelled market fears on Friday when he told Reuters that his organisation was unlikely to step in with extra supplies if the Iranian crisis worsened . '
If Iran decides to stop production , or is forced to stop production because of a sanction , I do n't think Opec necessarily has a role to play there , ' he said .
Crude peaked at just over $ 70 a barrel last autumn after hurricane Katrina , but demand from fast - growing economies such as China and India , together with supply shortages in a number of producing countries , has prevented prices from dropping much below $ 60 .
Investment in Russian oil production has been weak since President Putin 's tax raid on the oil giant Yukos , and Iraqi output is well below the levels Washington hoped for before coalition tanks rolled into Baghdad .
A cold snap in the US , which has so far had an unusually warm winter , could push prices up further in the weeks ahead . '
Should cold weather return to the US , then we 'll really be in trouble , ' said Laughlin ."
2006-02-05,"Iran ignored world condemnation of its controversial nuclear programme last night by ordering the resumption of uranium enrichment .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called a halt from today to inspections of his country 's nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Iran 's defiance came in response to a decision by the United Nations nuclear watchdog , which overwhelmingly voted to report Tehran to the Security Council over its nuclear programme .
The top UN body has the power to censure Iran over its nuclear plans , which some fear could be part of a secret weapons programme , or order sanctions and ultimately the use of force to resolve the dispute .
After more than two days ' wrangling over wording , an emergency session of the board of the IAEA meeting in Vienna decided by 27 to three to risk Iranian retaliation and haul Tehran before the supreme world authority .
Although the resolution asked the security council to defer any action for a month , giving Iran an opportunity to climb back from a showdown , Tehran immediately signalled an escalation of the crisis .
Javad Vaeedi , deputy head of its national security council , denounced the decision , saying Iran would instantly embark on industrial - scale enrichment of uranium - the main path to a nuclear bomb .
And Tehran said later it would end snap UN inspections of its nuclear plants from today .
If the Iranians carry out their threats it will be far harder to monitor what is going on in their nuclear projects .
They are also expected to reject a compromise offer from the Russians .
Talks were expected in Moscow in a fortnight on the offer to enrich uranium for Iran 's nuclear programme , ensuring that the Iranians obtain nuclear fuel for power plants but are unable to get highly enriched uranium used in nuclear warheads .
That scheme - viewed by IAEA officials and Western diplomats as the best hope for pulling back from the brink of a much more dangerous confrontation - looked dead last night .
As the crisis deepened , Angela Merkel , the German Chancellor , drew parallels between Ahmadinejad and Hitler .
She warned an international security conference in Munich : ' Looking back to German history in the early Thirties when National Socialism was on the rise , there were many outside Germany who said , "" It 's only rhetoric - do n't get excited "" ' .
The referral to the security council was a victory for Washington , which has been arguing for the shift for two years .
The Europeans preferred to negotiate and resisted US pressure .
But the collapse of the negotiations last month when Iran removed UN seals at its uranium enrichment site meant the Europeans had little choice but going to the security council .
More crucially , countries more sympathetic to Iran , such as Russia , China and India , also voted to take the dispute to New York , leaving Iran with few friends apart from Cuba , Venezuela and Syria .
Peter Jenkins , British ambassador to the IAEA , said the Security Council could bring extra pressure to bear on Iran ' if necessary ' .
The decision reflected the board 's ' lack of confidence in Iran 's nuclear intentions ' .
Iran is now likely to press ahead with its underground uranium enrichment complex at Natanz , which it had been developing clandestinely for 18 years until its existence was revealed in 2002 .
The complex is for 50,000 centrifuges , sophisticated and sensitive machines arrayed in cascades and spinning at supersonic speeds to convert uranium gas into fuel for power plants or fissile material for nuclear warheads .
They plan to assemble six rigs of 164 centrifuges each to enrich uranium gas .
But assembling and testing the centrifuges could take at least a year , say IAEA officials ."
2006-02-06,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's provocation of the west has become his trademark and yesterday Iran 's hardline president echoed the defiant rhetoric of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , spiritual leader of the country 's Islamic revolution , towards America during the 1979 - 81 Tehran embassy siege .
"" We do not need you at all , "" he said .
Brave words and , on the face of it
, Mr Ahmadinejad appears to have reason to be confident .
Iranians , after all , endured terrible sacrifices during the 1980s , beginning with the revolution and followed by the bloody eight - year war with Iraq .
Given that precedent , he is perhaps entitled to think that any economic sanctions resulting from Iran 's referral to the UN security council over its nuclear programme could be faced down .
Yet many Iranians are unconvinced .
Much as Mr Ahmadinejad likes to hark back to the revolution 's halcyon early days , that was then - this is now .
Even within a tight Islamic straitjacket , times in Iran have changed .
Crucially for the president , he was elected last June by voters who , far from volunteering to undergo further sacrifice , were wooed by his promises of a better economic future and of putting the profits of Iran 's vast oil wealth on ordinary people 's tables .
Thus the very source of Mr Ahmadinejad 's electoral appeal makes him more vulnerable to sanctions than he cares to admit .
Economists are also sceptical of his implied boast that the west is dependent on trade with Iran , pointing out that the Islamic republic accounts for a meagre 0.4 % of world trade . ""
The economy of Iran is much more dependent on oil supply and revenue than it was in 1997 , "" said Saeed Leylaz , a Tehran - based economic analyst .
"" In 1997 , our oil revenues were about $ 12bn ( £ 6.8bn ) .
This year they are about $ 35bn . ""
The tolerance of people to resist potential sanctions has decreased in that time .
Iran consumes much more now than eight years ago , from private cars to luxury goods .
The direction of the Iranian economy is in direct contradiction to our diplomacy .
A country that says ' Down with the USA ' should n't open its doors to all the world 's consumer durables .
In a sanctions situation , we would face very high inflation , which would be in direct contradiction to Mr Ahmadinejad 's promises to the people last summer .
I do n't believe the people are ready to sacrifice themselves .
Most people are n't involved in the nuclear programme and it 's not a national issue for most Iranians .
Sanctions would be harmful for both sides , but for us much more than the other side .
"" That prognosis was echoed elsewhere yesterday .
Ali Khoram , a political analyst , accused Iran 's nuclear negotiating team of having an "" optimist view "" towards being referred to the security council .
"" I recommend to the government that they re - think this optimist , confident and almost carefree attitude , "" he told the English language newspaper Iran News .
"" They should carefully study the consequences of referral . ""
An MP , Mohammad Khoshchehreh , agreed .
"" We need strategic management at this stage .
We should not make decisions based on emotions and slogans . """
2006-02-06,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , taunted the west yesterday after his country was referred to the UN security council over its suspected nuclear weapons ambitions .
As Tehran took swift retaliatory action , Mr Ahmadinejad told the west there was nothing it could do to stop Iran .
He said : "" Our enemies can not do a damn thing .
We do not need you at all .
But you are in need of the Iranian nation . ""
His defiant response came after the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , the UN 's atomic watchdog , voted on Saturday by 27 to three - Syria , Cuba and Venezuela - with five abstentions to refer the issue to the security council , which could impose sanctions .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's remarks will add to jitters when the markets open today , with a possible jump in oil prices .
Iran , the world 's fourth biggest oil producer , has threatened to respond to sanctions by pushing up oil prices .
Tehran responded to the security council referral by :
· Stopping IAEA inspectors from carrying out surprise inspections of Iranian nuclear sites , making it harder for the international community to police Iran 's activities . ·
Scrapping a voluntary agreement reached in 2003 that included not only the surprise inspections but a suspension of uranium enrichment , a step towards attaining a nuclear weapons capability .
· Initiating a bill in the Iranian parliament to restrict the sale of American goods in Iran .
Manouchehr Mottaki , Iran 's foreign minister , said yesterday that the IAEA 's decision presented Iran with two options .
"" One was the option of resistance and the other was surrender .
We chose resistance , "" he said .
Although the issue goes to the security council immediately , it would not make any decision about action against Iran until after the IAEA meets again on March 6 , giving Tehran a month 's breathing space .
Iran sent conflicting signals over the weekend over whether it would pursue diplomatic options during this period .
On Saturday Javad Vaeidi , deputy head of the powerful National Security Council , ruled out acceptance of a Russian compromise plan , the only deal left on the table .
But a foreign ministry spokesman , Hamid Reza Asefi , told a press conference in Tehran yesterday that Iran would go ahead with talks with Russia on February 16 but Russia 's proposal would have to be "" adjusted "" .
Sergei Ivanov , Russia 's defence minister , backed Mr Ahmadinejad 's view that there was little the west could do .
He said sanctions would not have much effect .
The US , emboldened by the IAEA 's decision , which will give it more control over the issue , expressed a determination to prevent Tehran acquiring a weapons capability .
President George Bush said the referral to the security council "" sends a clear message to the regime in Iran that the world will not permit the Iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons "" .
Ehud Olmert , the acting prime minister of Israel , which Mr Ahmadinejad has threatened to wipe off the face of the Earth said Iran would pay "" a very heavy price "" for resuming full - scale uranium enrichment .
The US and Israel have refused to rule out air strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities .
Donald Rumsfeld , the US defence secretary , reiterated this yesterday .
He said this was partly because of Mr Ahmadinejad 's approach to Israel . ""
Any government that says Israel has no right to exist is making a statement about its possible behaviour in the future , "" he said .
But Abdolrahim Moussavi , head of Iran 's joint chiefs of staff , warned that any military strike would be useless .
"" We are not seeking a military confrontation , but if that happens we will give the enemy a lesson that will be remembered throughout history , "" he said ."
2006-02-07,"Now the mad mullahs of Iran will soon have nuclear bombs , are we all doomed ?
Thumbing his nose at the impotent west , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad taunts us : "" Our enemies can not do a damn thing .
We do not need you at all .
But you are in need of the Iranian nation . ""
And he is absolutely right .
A frisson of panic shudders around the globe : he has already threatened to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth .
Do something , someone !
But what and who ?
And if there is nothing to be done , what then ?
The International Atomic Energy Agency has failed to stop Iran restarting its nuclear programme .
The matter has been referred to the UN , with a decision on any possible action in early March .
But that may be yet another dismal reminder of UN incapacity .
Meanwhile , the Americans are grinding out ritual bellicose statements , Donald Rumsfeld refusing to rule out air strikes .
The Israelis warn that Iran will pay "" a very heavy price "" and Iran replies that if anyone attacks "" we will give the enemy a lesson that will be remembered throughout history "" .
Is this the way the world ends ?
All this suggests that international diplomacy is not one whit wiser than it ever was .
Talking to experts in the field , these appear to be a few key facts : even if the US or Israel strike down the sites where they think Iranian nuclear weapons are being built , that can only delay their development .
( How good are we at finding weapons anyway ? )
If Iran wants weapons above all else , it can get them by around 2010 .
Unlike Libya , Iran may well put national pride before economic growth , ignoring any harm sanctions can do them .
If the world 's fourth largest producer sends oil prices through the roof , it can cause near - nuclear damage to the global economy .
If this is how the west wants to play it , then Iran seems to hold some strong cards .
History sheds light , but offers few answers .
The Anglo - American coup knocking over Mossadegh in 1953 to enthrone the shah was another shining example of how western crusaders for democracy prop up dictators in exchange for oil , afraid of the elections they pretend to champion .
That is the paradox of the White House dream of turning Afghanistan and Iraq into "" beacons of democracy "" to spread their light across the Middle East .
Yet - at least at first - democracy was always bound to bring mullahs and religious parties to power in Kabul and Baghdad or the Muslim Brotherhood 's rise in Egypt .
More theocratic parties are the price of free elections , and the west has to accept it .
American pride is easily bruised , unused to taking such humiliations as the 1979 embassy - hostage crisis that lasted 444 shaming days and the Iran - backed Beirut embassy attack that slaughtered 241 marines .
On its side , Iran will never forgive the US for backing Iraq in the bloody eight - year Iran - Iraq war .
So the two countries have barely attempted to speak in all these years : admirable EU attempts at peacemaking could not bridge that historic bile .
Without the US at the table , a deal was impossible .
On the face of it , Iran has every reason to feel insecure .
While America occupies two of Iran 's neighbours and Israel 's nuclear weapons point at Tehran , paranoia seems as justified as it is dangerous .
Yet Iran knows its strength .
The Iraq adventure has exposed the painful limits to force , and America can no longer make a credible threat of invasion : it has forfeited the power to frighten .
What 's more , Iran is the true winner of that war .
They only had to sit tight and smile as the west delivered on a golden plate all the influence Iran had always sought in the Middle East .
The US and its allies will soon be gone from Afghanistan and Iraq , leaving Iranian - backed Shias dominant in both countries , their influence well spread across Syria , a chunk of Saudi Arabia and other countries for decades to come .
Historic Iranian ambitions have been fulfilled without firing a shot while the US is reduced to fist - shaking .
How foolish was that ?
If Iran is determined , no one can stop it becoming a nuclear power , alongside Israel , Pakistan and India .
The crazed dictator of North Korea shows the way : nuclear weapons make nations unassailable .
Why on earth would Iran not want them too ?
It is much odder that Britain demands them .
What for ?
Protection against whom ?
John Reid has said Trident will be replaced - and now Gordon Brown has said he too would renew our nuclear weapons , despite the £ 20bn price tag and a lack of anyone to point them at .
If we can seriously consider such expensive folly in pursuit of strutting our stuff and punching above our weight to buy a UN security council seat , we can hardly pretend outrage at Iran 's ambitions .
But fantasy diplomacy is taking a grip .
The pretence is that the world united can deflect Tehran : there is still a small chance that Russia 's offer to strike a deal could work .
But the experts expect an aggressive stand - off , with a risk of futile air attacks .
Even if no blood is spilt , the west may find itself in a cold jihad with a God - driven , nuclear - armed adversary , and no solution in sight .
Nothing suggests that sanctions and fiery words will make the more moderate forces in Iran overthrow their mullahs and choose westernisation : under external pressure in this clash of civilisations , history suggests they will close ranks .
Meanwhile , oil - hungry nations will do dirty backdoor deals : oil tends to trump UN resolutions .
Fantasy diplomacy is ready to fight all the way to stop the mullahs getting the bomb .
Reality suggests there is a difficult choice : if you can not win , give up at once to minimise the damage .
Get off the high horse and start to negotiate terms on which Iran can be allowed to enrich uranium .
It amounts to turning a blind eye to their weapons potential while striking a deal that saves their face , affords them some dignity and entices them economically into becoming a more stable force .
It takes some swallowing , but what if there is no alternative ?
Either they have nuclear weapons and we are at cold war , or else they have nuclear weapons and we have an uneasy kind of peace .
But that decision has to be made before UN sanctions ratchet up the rhetoric to no - turning - back resistance .
It may be beyond the ability of this White House to climb down , but the US should remember Aesop 's fable
The Sun and the Wind : when they competed to get a man 's coat off , the full force of a cold blast only made him hold on to it tighter , but the warmth of the sun made him take it off by himself .
So far US diplomacy over Iran echoes Louis XVIII 's court : they seem to have forgotten nothing and learned nothing .

2006-02-09,"Over in the States , a professor at Chicago 's Northwestern University has publicly welcomed the assertions of Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's that the holocaust is a ' myth ' .
Engineering professor Arthur Butz was quoted last week by the English - language Tehran Times and Iran 's semi - official Mehr news agency in approving terms and is being promoted as a ' world scholar ' who supports the ever - so - slightly controversial stance , quoting Butz as saying "" I congratulate him [ Ahmadinejad ] on becoming the first head of state to speak out clearly on these issues and regret only that it was not a Western head of state , "" Butz 's opinions have not been welcomed in the US . ""
Butz 's most recent invective demonstrates the power of hate to rally extremists , anti - Semites and Holocaust deniers out from under their rocks throughout the world , "" said Richard Hirschhaut , executive director of the Holocaust Foundation of Illinois , quoted in the Chicago Tribune .
The university has been aware of Butz 's stance since 1976 when he published The Hoax of the Twentieth Century :
The Case Against the Presumed Extermination of European Jewry .
They seem to view him with exasperation , rather than anger - Northwestern University spokesman Al Cubbage told the Tribune that the university does not agree with Butz : "" As certainly has been made clear on many occasions , Northwestern University as an institution obviously does not endorse or agree with the personal opinions of professor Butz , "" Cubbage said .
"" At the same time , however , the university does believe that its faculty members are entitled to express their own personal opinions . ""
While that may well be the case , does this entitlement really need to stretch so far as to give the professor university webspace to put his opinions across ?
A question of free speech , or an abuse of the right ?"
2006-03-05,"With his desire to purge Iranian culture of the un - Islamic influence of ' decadent western music ' , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad needs all the allies he can get .
But now he has support in the unlikely form of Kiarash Alimi , a teenage Iranian musician who has taken up rap to persuade fellow youth their tastes are misguided .
Ahmadinejad has responded to the dilution of Iran 's once - flourishing Islamic revolutionary culture by banning songs by such stars as George Michael and Eric Clapton from state TV and radio .
The ban will affect millions of young Iranians , who avidly follow western music .
Alimi , 19 , who is among Iran 's most promising artists , has backed the ultra - conservative President by attacking the ' cultural bombardment ' from the West and counter - attacking the enemy through one of its most subversive sounds : rap .
In his album The Guy From Shahrak - e Gharb , named after an affluent north Tehran suburb , he lampoons wealthy young Iranians who submerge their national identity beneath a facade of basketball , Che Guevara T - shirts and street talk based on that of America 's inner cities .
With more than a dash of irony , the title song draws on the influence of US rapper Eminem , who is a big hit in Iran . '
The West can impose many cultural influences on us because they have the most powerful media in the world , ' Alimi said . '
But we can not export our culture to America , even though Iran has a history and culture that 's far older .
We are under a cultural bombardment . '
With lyrics unsparing in contempt for pseudo - American pretensions but full of swearing , the album is probably not what Ahmadinejad had in mind when he had the Supreme Cultural Revolutionary Council order broadcasters to return to ' classic and fine Iranian music ' .
This decree has provoked dismay among many musicians who fear a return to the austere days of the Islamic revolution when nearly all music was banned .
But Alimi said : ' If [ Ahmadinejad 's ] target is the invasion of a form of cultural decadence , then we have the same aims . '"
2006-03-26,"President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is cracking down on Iran 's universities in an effort to crush a student pro - democracy movement and strengthen the hardliners ' grip on power .
Leading student activists have been jailed or expelled from their studies , and lecturers have been sacked , while the government has proposed subjecting academics to strict religious testing .
The authorities have also begun a programme of burying the bodies of unknown soldiers on campus grounds in what student leaders say is a thinly disguised attempt to bring religious extremists into the universities on the pretext of holding "" martyrs ' ceremonies "" .
Students fear that such a presence will be used to violently suppress their activities .
In one recent incident students at Tehran 's Sharif University were attacked by plain - clothed Basij ( religious volunteers ) during an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the burial of three soldiers from the 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq war inside the campus mosque .
The incident was overseen by Mehrdad Bazrpash , a close aide to Mr Ahmadinejad and a former Basij leader .
The event took place against a backdrop of speeches by Mr Ahmadinejad , a former university lecturer , stressing the need for "" martyrdom "" in Iran 's confrontation with the west over its nuclear programme .
Student leaders say the developments amount to a takeover of the universities by Mr Ahmadinejad 's ultra - conservative forces .
The campuses were hotbeds of pro - democratic protest during the presidency of the former , reformist leader , Mohammad Khatami .
"" They want to gain hegemonic control over the universities , which have always been important in influencing the social and political atmosphere and which normally support pro - democracy rather than authoritarian forces , "" said Abdollah Momeni , an activist appealing against a five - year sentence imposed for leading a student protest .
"" Through burying martyrs on campus they open the doors for the entry of armed militias and thus add the universities to their fiefdoms . ""
Other activists have had their studies terminated after the intervention of Iran 's intelligence services .
Students also say they have been denied permission for low - level political activities that were allowed during Mr Khatami 's presidency .
The purge has extended to academics and university administrators .
One political science lecturer was dismissed for belonging to a human rights group .
The chancellor of Tehran 's Science and Industry University resigned in protest at government interference .
Mr Ahmadinejad has also been accused of overturning an established practice of appointing chancellors and faculty heads from academic staff in favour of trusted cronies .
A radical cleric was recently appointed to head Tehran University ."
2006-03-30,"Increased repression and unrest affecting Iran 's numerous ethnic and religious minorities are providing new opportunities for the US as it steps up efforts to destabilise and if possible bring down the hardline Islamic government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Kurdish sources say persecution of Iran 's estimated six million Kurds , who mostly live in western provinces bordering Turkey and Iraq , has intensified since Mr Ahmadinejad came to power .
Weeks of turmoil followed his election last July - and is continuing .
Ten Iranian Revolutionary Guards were killed in the latest clashes this week in Salmas and Kelares , according to Iranian and Kurdish reports .
Although groups such as the Kurdistan People 's Democratic party have renounced violence , the Kurdistan Free Life party , affiliated to the Turkish separatist PKK , has carried on the fight .
More than 120 members of the security forces are said to have died in the past year . ""
The Kurdish population has long been viewed with suspicion by the Iranian authorities and has experienced decades of official neglect , "" Amnesty International reported in February . ""
The months since Ahmadinejad came to power have seen no improvement .
On the contrary , there have been signs ... of a further harshening of repression . ""
Despite constitutional guarantees of equality , individuals belonging to minorities , believed to number about half Iran 's population , are subject to an array of discriminatory laws and practices , including restrictions on social , cultural , linguistic and religious freedoms which often result in human rights violations . ""
Ibrahim Dogus of Halkevi , a Kurdish and Turkish community organisation , said Kurdish leaders wanted international support to end human rights abuses .
But any regime change in Tehran should "" come from the bottom "" rather than be imposed from outside , he said .
Ethnically Arab Khuzestan province , in south - west Iran , has witnessed several recent bomb attacks , including a rumoured attempt to assassinate Mr Ahmadinejad in Ahvaz in January .
The attacks have been attributed to separatists .
But Iranian officials blame Britain , whose troops occupy adjacent areas of south - east Iraq , and its US ally for instigating the violence .
Coincidentally or not , "" British intelligence "" was also officially accused of colluding with "" bandits "" in Sistan - Baluchestan this month after 21 government officials were shot dead .
Like separatists in Khuzestan , the south - eastern province 's large ethnic Baluchi Sunni population has long protested about discrimination by the Persian Shia majority .
Iran 's leaders also face stirrings of discontent in the north - east , home to two to three million ethnic Turkmen .
According to Muhammad Tahir of the Institute for War and Peace Reporting , Turkmen say the Persian language , dress codes and customs are being forced on them . ""
Sunni Muslims in a theocratic Shia state , they feel disadvantaged for both ethnic and religious reasons . ""
Government fears about the "" enemy within "" may have been reflected in a recent move to further pressure Iran 's Baha'i community , which is not allowed to practice its faith and has often been subject to persecution at times of national strain .
The UN condemned the move as "" impermissible and unacceptable interference with the rights of religious minorities "" .
A renewed crackdown on student groups has also been launched .
External pressure from non - Persian and mostly non - Shia minorities is being applied via the exiled Congress of Iranian Nationalities , which issued a manifesto in London last year .
The congress demanded a federal Iran , separation of religion and state , and an end to all forms of discrimination .
President George Bush 's national security strategy , published this month , again urged Iranians to rise up against their "" oppressors "" .
But whether the US can or should try to exploit Iran 's ethnic and religious fault - lines is a matter of debate in Washington .
Officialdom is split between those who fear triggering an uncontrollable , Iraq - style disintegration ; and those , notably in the Pentagon , who think they see a way of dishing the mullahs where snail - paced UN diplomacy and high - risk military threats have so far failed .
Iranian officials say western attempts to divide the Iranian nation , forged in revolution and a bloody war with Saddam Hussein , are bound to fail .
They are especially scornful of regional Arab and Iranian diaspora hopes of encouraging change from without .
But nerves are jangling all the same .
Today will see the beginning of Noble Prophet , a large - scale Iranian military exercise along the length of the Gulf , the area where any future military attacks might be expected .
Rear - Admiral Morteza Saffari said the wargames would start with the firing of a Shahab-2 medium - range missile .
The launch of this formidable weapon , he told an Iranian news agency , was intended as "" a message of peace and friendship "" to all Iran 's neighbours .
The admiral 's grimly ambiguous greeting conveyed a blunter warning :
Keep Out ."
2006-04-10,"Our front page story this morning on Seymour Hersh 's New Yorker article that accuses George Bush of being intent on regime change in Iran brought two responses .
One that this feels very like the period before the invasion of Iraq , that the plan is more than just war games , but that some in Washington and the Pentagon are worried enough to tell Hersh of their misgivings .
The feeling from moderate opinion inside Iran is that such a policy would galvanise support for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The other current of opinion is that this is just the view of the Pentagon and White House hawks and that the mainstream thought in the Foreign Office and the State Department is that there is life left in the diplomacy route , hope that Iran 's nuclear ambitions can be curtailed or delayed , and that realistic planning and analysis of a future Middle East with another possible nuclear state is firmly on the agenda .
Jacques Chirac 's abandonment of the proposed youth labour law that has caused weeks of protest prompted the observation that on most other accounts the French economy is in good health .
It is only the rigid employment laws that are causing problems and a small but significant proposal for reform led to a huge protest movement .
There is a lively debate in France at the moment about the way forward , the kind of debate not seen in this country for many years .
Paradoxically , a recent poll saw 63 % of those questioned being opposed to capitalism and this is likely to be reflected electorally next May.

2006-04-10,"He is a passionate football fan who likes nothing better than putting on a tracksuit and kicking a ball around .
And he 's also the president of Iran .
Today , a major row broke out over whether Mahmoud Ahmadinejad - who described the Holocaust as a "" fairytale "" and called for Israel to be "" wiped from the map "" - should be allowed to visit Germany for this summer 's World Cup .
Last week , Iranian football officials said it was "" entirely possible "" that the president would travel to Germany to see Iran slug it out in Group D against Mexico , Angola and Portugal .
Over the weekend , Germany 's interior minister , Wolfgang Schäuble , said there was nothing his government could do to stop Mr Ahmadinejad , a head of state , from turning up this June .
But Germany 's Jewish Council criticised the minister 's laissez - faire stance , pointing out that , under German law , the Iranian president could be arrested for the crime of Holocaust denial - a fate that recently befell the British historian David Irving .
"" There is no doubt that Ahmadinejad 's public comments denying the Holocaust and calling for the destruction of Israel infringe paragraph 130 of Germany 's statute book , "" Stephan Kramer , the council 's secretary general , said .
"" If this is the method with which the interior minister deals with Holocaust deniers in future , then people like Irving can relax . ""
Bavaria 's rightwing minister - president , Edmund Stoiber , also expressed unease .
"" It 's self - evident that someone who denies the Holocaust and launches tirades against the Jewish state is n't going to get an enthusiastic reception , "" he said .
During the four - week tournament , the Iranian team will be staying in the idyllic southern German lakeside town of Friedrichshafen .
How far they get during the World Cup is anyone 's guess .
The three first round matches are already the focus of intense security .
German neo - Nazi groups have announced their intention to stage a demonstration in support of Iran 's otherwise friendless president during Iran 's match against Angola in the East German city of Leipzig .
The far - right National Party of Germany ( NPD ) has called on its website for a "" show of solidarity "" with Tehran 's clerical regime .
FIFA , meanwhile , has ruled out throwing Iran out of the World Cup , making clear it believes there is a strict distinction between politics and sport .
But Spain , Romania and Ukraine have all called off friendy matches against Iran in the wake of Ahmadinejad 's anti - semitic comments last year .
This does n't appear to have bothered Iran 's leader , though .
In early March , he demonstrated his support for his country 's team before their warm - up match against Costa Rica , Germany 's Group A opponents in the opening World Cup match on June 9 , turning up at the team 's training camp in a tracksuit . ""
The world does n't want our sportsmen to be successful in the same way it does n't want us to have nuclear energy , "" he said , taking a few shots at goal .
Iran won the game 3 - 2 .
Could this be the year that they win the World Cup as well ?"
2006-04-11,"Iran 's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has announced that his country has succeeded in enriching uranium while insisting that Tehran has no plans to produce nuclear weapons .
He said that Iran intended to reach industrial levels of nuclear production and demanded that western countries respect his country 's right to nuclear technology .
The remarks came shortly after his nuclear chief and vice president , Gholamreza Aghazadeh , declared that Iran had stockpiled 110 tons of uranium gas and begun operations at a pilot enrichment plant at Natanz , south of Tehran .
"" I am proud to announce that we have started enriching uranium to the 3.5 percent level , "" said Mr Aghazadeh , referring to the level of the radioactive isotope uranium-235 needed to sustain a nuclear reaction .
While Iran insists its nuclear programme is intended only for peaceful civil purposes , the United States , Britain and other European Union nations claim it is a smokescreen for building atomic weapons .
Uranium needs to be enriched for use in nuclear power stations , but the same technology can be used to further enrich it to the point where it can be used in atomic weapons .
President Ahmedinejad said that Iran "" will soon join the club of countries possessing nuclear technology "" .
"" Enemies ca n't dissuade the Iranian nation from the path of progress that it has chosen , "" Mr Ahmadinejad was quoted by Iranian television as saying at a speech in the northeast of the country .
In an interview earlier today with Kuwaiti news agency Kuna in Tehran , former president Hashemi Rafsanjani said Iran had "" put into operation the first unit of 164 centrifuges , has injected [ uranium ] gas and has reached industrial production "" .
He added : "" We should expand the work of these machines to achieve a full industrial line .
We need dozens of these units [ of 164 centrifuges ] to achieve a uranium enrichment facility . ""
Yesterday , Mr Ahmadinejad , who defeated Mr Rafsanjani in last year 's presidential election , had promised he would soon announce some "" good nuclear news "" .
At the end of last month , the UN Security Council called on Iran to end all efforts to enrich uranium by April 28 , a move which could be followed by sanctions in the future .
Iran rejected the call .
The head of the UN 's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency , Mohamed ElBaradei , is due in Iran later this week for talks on the standoff .
"" When ElBaradei arrives in Iran , he will face new circumstances , "" Mr Rafsanjani told the Kuwaiti agency .
His comments are Tehran 's first claim that it has successfully enriched uranium since it began research at an enrichment facility in February .
Low - level enrichment produces fuel that can be used in civilian nuclear reactors , while further processing turns this into potential material for nuclear weapons .
Iran would require thousands of centrifuges operating for a number of months to produce sufficient uranium for even one nuclear weapon , according to experts .
A Foreign Office spokesman reminded Iran of the Security Council 's demands , calling Mr Rafsanjani 's comments "" not particularly helpful "" .
Earlier this week , a report in the New Yorker magazine claimed Washington was stepping up plans for a possible air strike on Iranian nuclear facilities , perhaps even using tactical nuclear weapons to target deep bunkers .
President George Bush dismissed the report as "" wild speculation "" ."
2006-04-11,"Iran announced a technological breakthrough yesterday that could lead to the development of a nuclear bomb , in a move that appeared to catch the west off guard .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's hardline president , trumpeted the development in a speech last night .
"" Dear Iran has joined the club of nuclear countries , "" he said in the holy city of Mashhad .
Addressing an invited audience of clerics , military figures and dignitaries , Mr Ahmadinejad made an unabashed appeal to national pride : "" The nation , under the umbrella of God 's grace and through its own efforts , has reached this big achievement .
Today is a big day which will be recorded in Iran 's history . ""
Iranian television broadcast pictures of scientists dancing and waving test tubes apparently marked with chemical symbols .
Mr Ahmadinejad , who has threatened to wipe Israel off the map , said the nuclear programme was for purely civilian purposes .
The US , Europe and Israel remain sceptical .
The speech - carried live on state TV - was punctuated by chants of "" Death to America "" , "" Death to Israel "" , and "" Death to counter - revolutionaries "" .
Tehran 's defiance comes after weeks of increasing pressure from the west , including a report that the White House is contemplating a tactical nuclear strike .
Analysts said Iran had shaved the timescale for production of nuclear weapons and predicted it could join the nuclear club within three to five years .
The US expressed dismay , as did Britain and other European countries .
Scott McClellan , the White House spokesman , said Iran was "" moving in the wrong direction "" and , if it persisted , the US would discuss possible next steps with other members of the UN security council .
A Foreign Office spokesman said the speech was "" not particularly helpful "" .
On March 29 the security council imposed a deadline - April 28 - on Iran to stop all uranium enrichment .
Mohamed ElBaradei , the head of the UN 's watchdog , the IAEA , who is to report to the security council on Iran 's compliance , will arrive in Tehran today to try to broker a deal .
Despite the nature of the announcement , Mr Ahmadinejad sounded less confrontational than usual and held out the prospect that Mr ElBaradei 's mission may not be in vain .
"" All our activities have been carried out under the gaze of International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and we would like to carry on under their eyes , "" he said .
Some diplomats and analysts in Tehran speculated that the fanfare surrounding the announcement may be a prelude to the regime saying it was ready to bow to UN demands that it suspend enrichment activities and re - enter negotiations .
"" Their goal is to claim a very big victory and achievement and say , ' Now that we have reached our goal and public opinion has been satisfied we will go for compromise with the UN security council and US , ' "" said Saeed Leylaz , a political analyst .
According to sources in Tehran , Mr ElBaradei will be taken to the Natanz plant and asked to recognise that Iran has mastered the full nuclear fuel cycle .
Such recognition could greatly strengthen Iran 's bargaining position , analysts say .
One Tehran - based European diplomat said : "" I expect that they want ElBaradei to say something that recognises this new situation and that would propel them into a new phase .
If that leads to a renewed suspension , all well and good . """
2006-04-11,"The Security Council had been waiting for a UN report at the end of the month on Iran 's nuclear intentions , before deciding on further measures .
But after Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's triumphal announcement yesterday - accompanied by chants of "" Death to America "" , "" Death to Israel "" and "" Death to Counter - Revolutionaries "" - some UN members were drawing their own conclusions .
Not for the first time , US diplomats found themselves grateful that President Ahmadinejad had made the work of persuading other UN members of Tehran 's intentions so much easier .
"" I ca n't imagine anyone would be pleased by such a blatant disregard of what the council has asked for , "" the official said .
However , the findings of the report by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) are not a foregone conclusion .
The speed with which Iran has moved has surprised some experts , and it is possible that the Iranian leader was grandstanding for political reasons .
Whatever the reality at the enrichment facility in Natanz , though , the Iranian leadership has shown it is in no mood to comply .
If the IAEA report is overwhelmingly negative , the immediate goal of the US , with the support of British , French and German diplomats , is to turn up the international pressure on Iran while maintaining a consensus among the major powers as long as possible .
The American official said that the US delegation would wait until the IAEA director , Mohamed ElBaradei , reports on Iranian compliance with a Security Council demand that it suspend uranium enrichment and open its nuclear facilities to international inspection .
That demand was non - binding , essentially a political request .
The next step for the US and its allies will be to seek a binding resolution , possibly under chapter seven of the UN charter , which deals with threats to international peace and security .
Such a resolution would be intended to put international legal pressure on Iran , rather than as an immediate preface to military action .
Nevertheless Russia and China have shown themselves reluctant to give their agreement , fearing it could be used in future to justify an attack on Iran .
The negotiations over the next step are likely to be long and heated , particularly as they will be played out against a backdrop of reports of US military planning .
Russia and China may agree to abstain in a vote on a resolution , but if not , the US has made it clear it will go it alone with bilateral sanctions .
Earlier this week , Javier Solana , the European Union foreign policy chief , said the EU would consider its own sanctions , perhaps restricting European visas to Iranian officials .
Another possibility is the withholding of credit guarantees for private companies dealing with Iran .
After the sanctions stage , however , the unity between the US and Europe is likely to break down .
Mr Solana said : "" Any military action is absolutely [ off ] the table for us . ""
The Bush administration refuses to rule out the use of force and the recent press reports about military planning for possible air strikes could have been deliberately linked for psychological effect ."
2006-04-12,"The foreign secretary , Jack Straw , today said he was "" seriously concerned "" by Iran 's announcement that it had successfully enriched uranium for the first time .
Senior politicians in France , Germany and Russia also voiced anxiety about yesterday 's comments by the hardline Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Mr Ahmadinejad , speaking in the holy city of Mashhad , said : "" Dear Iran has joined the club of nuclear countries . ""
Mr Straw said he was "" seriously concerned about President Ahmadinejad 's statement "" .
"" It is contrary to repeated requests by the International Atomic Energy Agency board and now by the [ UN ] security council that Iran resume full and sustained suspension of all enrichment and reprocessing activities , including research and development , "" he added .
The foreign secretary said the Iranian regime had to demonstrate that it was not seeking to build nuclear weapons .
If Iran did not comply , he said the security council would "" discuss further diplomatic measures "" .
Mohamed ElBaradei , the head of the IAEA , is travelling to Iran for talks aimed at resolving the standoff over the country 's nuclear programme .
Britain , France and Germany cut off more than two years of negotiations with Tehran after it said it would resume its enrichment activities earlier this year .
The security council has demanded that Iran stop all enrichment by April 28 because of suspicions the programme is intended to manufacture nuclear weapons .
Mikhail Kamynin , a Russian foreign ministry spokesman , said his country - which has close ties with Tehran - had learned of the Iranian announcement "" with concern "" .
"" We believe that this step is wrong .
It runs counter to decisions of the IAEA and resolutions of the UN security council , "" he told the ITAR - Tass news agency .
In Berlin , Angela Merkel 's government said the announcement was "" another step in the wrong direction by Iran "" , while French officials said France was "" in the process of diplomatic regulation of this affair "" and called on Iran to "" respect its obligations "" .
In an address to an invited audience of clerics , military figures and dignitaries yesterday , Mr Ahmadinejad said : "" The nation , under the umbrella of God 's grace and through its own efforts , has reached this big achievement . ""
Today is a big day which will be recorded in Iran 's history . ""

Some diplomats and analysts in Tehran said they believed the announcement could be a prelude to the regime saying it was ready to bow to UN demands that it suspend enrichment activities and re - enter negotiations ."
2006-04-13,"The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency today said the "" time is right for a political solution "" to the stand - off over Iran 's nuclear programme .
Speaking after the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , had defied international calls for the programme to be halted , Mohamed ElBaradei said : "" The way is negotiations . ""
The UN nuclear watchdog 's chief was speaking after arriving in Tehran for talks intended "" to clarify remaining issues about Iran 's nuclear programme "" .
He said Iran should suspend nuclear activities as a confidence - building measure "" until outstanding issues are clarified "" .
"" I would like to see Iran come to terms with the requests of the international community , "" he added .
Yesterday , Mr Ahmadinejad said Iran would ignore international pressure to halt uranium enrichment .
He pledged to press ahead with industrial - scale uranium enrichment and said the world must treat Iran as a nuclear power .
"" We know they [ the US and its allies ] are waiting for us to retreat an inch so that they use that [ against us ] , "" the official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as saying . ""
Today , our situation has changed completely .
We are a nuclear country and speak to others from the position of a nuclear country .
We wo n't hold talks with anyone about the right of Iranian nation [ to enrich uranium ] and no one has the right to retreat , even one iota . ""
Two days ago , the Iranian president revealed his country had for the first time enriched uranium to a level used in power stations .
The declaration sparked international concern , but western diplomats and atomic experts said Iran was still far from producing the weapons - grade uranium needed to produce nuclear warheads .
There are suspicions that Iran could be exaggerating the rate of its progress to enhance its standing as a potential member of the "" nuclear club "" .
The US said the UN security council , which can impose sanctions , must take "" strong steps "" to prevent further nuclear activity by Tehran .
Washington accuses Iran of using its civilian nuclear programme as a cover to build weapons - a charge Tehran denies .
The security council has told Iran to halt all sensitive atomic activities and asked the IAEA to report on its compliance by the end of April , prompting Mr ElBaradei 's visit .
However , IAEA diplomats voiced doubts about a deal being struck even before Mr Ahmadinejad 's defiant remarks .
Diplomats at the security council said the five permanent council members , along with Germany , would meet to discuss Iran next week .
The council was thought unlikely to take action before it received a report from Mr ElBaradei .
The level of enrichment needed for nuclear bombs is far higher than the 3.5 % Iran says it has achieved , and experts say it would take Tehran two decades to produce enough highly enriched uranium for one bomb from its current 164 centrifuges .
Iran has said it wants to install 54,000 centrifuges , which could theoretically produce material for a warhead within 25 to 73 days , according to analysts ."
2006-04-13,"Bells rang out in schools across Tehran yesterday in response to an order from Iran 's Islamic regime for a day of rejoicing in recognition of its claim to have joined the ranks of the world 's nuclear fuel producers .
At the elite Sharif University , the ringing could have been mistaken as tolling for something more ominous .
Renowned for producing some of Iran 's most gifted scientists , it was the scene of violent clashes last month between hardline supporters of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and secular pro - democracy students protesting against a scheme to bury the remains of dead soldiers on campus .
Yet that ideological conflict was forgotten yesterday as students of all shades basked in the patriotic pride evoked by Mr Ahmadinejad 's announcement on Tuesday that Iran had crossed the threshold to produce enriched uranium in defiance of the UN security council .
Just in case anyone failed to grasp the significance , a message on an electronic screen at the university entrance provided a prompter . ""
Congratulations - Iran joins the world 's nuclear countries , "" it read .
Despite the widespread perception of Iranian students as potential agents of political change , the scene yesterday amounted to an affirmation of Mr Ahmadinejad 's pronouncement that achieving the nuclear fuel cycle was a credit to the talents of Iran 's young scientists .
"" I felt happy when Ahmadinejad made his announcement because this is a real achievement , "" said Morteza , 27 , a chemical engineering student .
"" It made me think that what is more important to me than anything is this country .
I 'm ready to sacrifice myself if anything happens , regardless of any ideological or religious differences .
I do n't agree with the codes on liberty and freedom in our society , but this [ nuclear energy ] is different . ""
Mohammed Mohsen Chitchian , 20 , a chemical engineering student , said : "" Of course I feel happy .
Iran is making progress .
It 's not so long ago that we gained control over our oil industry .
Iran must use the benefits of its geographical position and it should not back down now and start negotiating . ""
Other students voiced similar sentiments , despite acknowledging misgivings about Iran 's political system .
"" I am proud , "" said Ali Reza Mir , 22 , a mechanical engineering student .
"" But if we want to judge from an intellectual viewpoint , it would be better for Iran to become a democratic society . ""
But this discontent did not extend to support for a possible US - inspired regime change . ""
With regime change , the US is only thinking about its own benefit , "" said Masha , 18 , a chemistry student .
Away from the febrile campus atmosphere , less triumphalist sentiments were aired . ""
Pride in a technological achievement is one thing , but if it 's going to damage the security of the country - and there 's every probability of that - then there 's no reason to feel proud , "" said Amir , 28 , coincidentally an expert in nuclear technology products , who was shopping in Tehran 's Enqelob Square .
"" I think the authorities should have the capacity of knowing how to deal with this kind of technology .
Judging from their record , I doubt that they have .
My sources close to the government inform me they are thinking of going for a bomb . """
2006-04-16,"The neo - con regimes in Washington and Tehran are on collision course after last week 's announcement by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that his country has ' joined the nuclear club ' .
Being able to enrich uranium to a low level of 3.5 per cent is a significant breakthrough for the Islamic Republic , but it still leaves the mullahs a long way from the 93 per cent - plus needed to make a bomb .
In the United States , however , the doom - sayers and war - mongers - who often overlap - reacted with a hardening of rhetoric .
The fundamentalists on both sides are in danger of talking themselves into a war .
The rising drumbeat of warrior journalism has almost created the illusion that a US military attack on Iran is inevitable .
Writing in the New Yorker last week , Seymour Hersh even quoted a former Pentagon official as saying that defence chiefs have considered targeting Iran with nuclear weapons to destroy underground research sites .
Few believe the US would be reckless enough to use such weapons .
Not only would it produce large amounts of radiation , killing thousands of civilians , but after Iraq the political implications of launching a nuclear attack on a Muslim country are unthinkable .
Some kind of attack is possible , but it is neither imminent nor inevitable .
In the meantime , the US administration should reflect on the words of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov , who warned that any military strike on Iran would spark a ' dangerous explosive blaze ' in the Middle East .
US military action would have two aims : first , to damage Iran 's nuclear - related sites and , second , to send a message that America is willing to take pre - emptive action not only to prevent WMD proliferation but also to stop Iran supporting terrorism .
This strategy could well backfire - and not simply because the UN will almost certainly decline to give it political or moral legitimacy .
Even with conventional weapons , any attack on the reactor at Bushehr would be catastrophic .
Iran might respond to ' unjustified ' US aggression in a number of other ways that would harm regional peace and security .
It could , for example , seek to prevent the supply of oil through the Strait of Hormuz , but most worrying of all , Ahmadinejad could further destabilise the south of Iraq by inciting Shia militias against coalition troops and the Sunni insurgency .
The likely outcome would be civil war .
Moreover , even a successful US military campaign would set back Iran 's research programme only by five years or so .
In the meantime , the logical step for Iran would be to withdraw from the Non - Proliferation Treaty and expel UN inspectors altogether .
Some neo - cons in the US believe that a military air assault would cause the people of Iran to rise up against their leaders .
In fact , every analysis suggests that a threat of military action would only rally Iranians behind their undemocratic government .
The strategic thinking of the regime has been quite simple : the US invaded Iraq because Iraq did not have nuclear weapons ; the US has not invaded North Korea because North Korea has nuclear weapons .
Instead of launching a premature military adventure , the US could simply acknowledge that Iran has security concerns - Pakistan , India and Israel all are nuclear - armed .
As a first step , President Bush should endorse the idea of creating a regional security organisation in the Middle East , which would include Iran .
It is likely that a more secure Iran would create better conditions for a pro - Western , peaceful , democratic movement inside the country .
And then the neo - cons in Washington might even see their dream of regime change in Tehran become a reality .

2006-04-18,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , today threatened to "" cut off the hands of any aggressor "" if the country was attacked .
In a speech to mark Iran 's army day , he told officers the country "" has to be constantly ready , equipped and powerful "" .
His speech - which was delivered prior to an armed march - past reminiscent of the cold war - said Iran "" has to be equipped with the latest technologies , recognise the enemy and constantly be vigilant "" .
The Iranian president 's remarks came less than a week after Tehran announced it had joined the "" nuclear club "" , claiming to have successfully enriched uranium .
They also followed reports that the US government was considering nuclear strikes on Iranian nuclear bases .
"" Iran 's enemies know your courage , faith and commitment to Islam and the land of Iran has created a powerful army that can powerfully defend the political borders and the integrity of the Iranian nation and cut the hand of any aggressor and place the sign of disgrace on their forehead , "" Mr Ahmadinejad said .
The march - past showcased Iran 's military forces , including thousands of troops , tanks , helicopters , fighter planes , submarines , torpedoes and missiles .
It was staged opposite the tomb of the Iranian revolution 's founder , Ayatollah Khomeini , close to the graves of tens of thousands of people killed during the 980 - 88 Iran - Iraq war .
However , the Shahab-3 missile , Iran 's longest - range weapon with a purported range of 1,250 miles - which would put Israel and US bases in the Persian Gulf within reach - was absent from the display .
Iran has stepped up its weapons programme in recent years , and claims to be developing sonar - invisible torpedoes and radar - evading missiles .
Mr Ahmadinejad said Iran 's army was intended only to "" serve peace and security for mankind "" .
"" It is humble towards friends and a shooting star toward enemies , "" he added .
International concerns over Iran 's nuclear programme have been heightened since the president 's election last year .
The enrichment technology announced last week can be used to further enrich uranium to a stage at which it is capable of being used in a nuclear bomb .
However , analysts believe Iran could be decades away from being able to achieve weapons .
Tehran says its nuclear programme is intended solely for peaceful energy generation , but the US claims it is attempting to develop atomic weapons .
Officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency have called on Mr Ahmadinejad to halt Iran 's enrichment programme , but Tehran marked a visit by the IAEA chief , Mohamed ElBaradei , last week by saying it would not retreat "" one iota "" from its nuclear ambitions .
Following the visit , Mr ElBaradei said IAEA observers had not seen Iran diverting nuclear material for use in weapons , but that the picture was "" hazy and unclear "" .
The five permanent UN security council members and Germany - the so - called five plus one group - are meeting in Moscow today to discuss Tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
A Chinese envoy this morning called on Iran to back down from its nuclear stance , but the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman , Hamid - Reza Asefi , said the five plus one nations had most to lose from the situation . ""
The meeting is more important for the participating countries than us , because they will be the ones that will suffer if they do not act wisely and [ they ] make a mistake again , "" Mr Asefi said .
Concern over Iran 's nuclear ambitions and the potential that Tehran could turn off the tap on its oil supplies drove oil prices to their highest - ever level in London today , with Brent crude leaping 74 cents to $ 72.20 ( £ 40.73 ) a barrel in early trading .
Dan Gillerman , the Israeli ambassador to the UN , yesterday described Iran , alongside Syria and the Palestinian Authority 's Hamas government , as a new "" axis of terror "" .
He said recent statements by the Iranian and Syrian governments were "" clear declarations of war "" against Israel .
In a speech on Friday , Mr Ahmadinejad described Israel as a "" rotten tree "" which would be destroyed by a coming "" storm "" .
He last year called for the country to be "" wiped off the map "" ."
2006-04-18,"Relations between the west and the hardline Iranian regime are set to worsen after a Tehran - based group claimed yesterday it was trying to recruit Iranians and other Muslims in Britain to carry out suicide bombings against Israel .
The Committee for the Commemoration of Martyrs of the Global Islamic Campaign , which claims to be independent but has the backing of the regime , said it is targeting potential recruits in Britain because of the relative ease with which UK passport - holders can enter Israel .
The claim came hours after nine people were killed by a suicide bomber in Tel Aviv , and days after a prediction by the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , that Israel would be blown away in a "" storm "" .
President George Bush refused to rule out a limited nuclear strike on Iranian nuclear facilities .
Mohammad Samadi , a spokesman for the group , told the Guardian that striking at Israel was the priority of his recruitment drive . ""
The first target is Israel .
For us , that is the battlefield , "" he said .
"" All the Jews are targets , whether military or civilian .
It 's our land and they are in the wrong place .
It 's their duty to pay attention to safety of their own families and move them away from the battlefield , "" he said .
Mr Samadi 's group was participating in a recruitment fair for "" martyrdom seekers "" being held in the grounds of the former US embassy in Tehran .
Several hundred volunteers have signed up for missions in the past few days .
Volunteers attracted to his group were asked to complete forms specifying whether they prefer to carry out operations against "" the Quds occupiers "" [ Israel ] , the British author Salman Rushdie - subject of a death sentence passed by Iran 's late spiritual leader , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , over The Satanic Verses - or "" the occupiers of Islamic lands "" , the US and Britain .
Mr Samadi was standing at an exhibition stall festooned with portraits of Palestinian suicide bombers , including pictures of the aftermaths of attacks .
It also featured a tribute to Rachel Corrie , the American peace activist killed by an Israeli army bulldozer in Gaza three years ago .
A banner outside the fair read : "" There is no voice higher than intifada . ""
Nearby stood a mock model of the Statue of Liberty , with iron bars cut into the torso to symbolise a prison cell .
The British embassy has called on the Iranian government to renounce support for the group .
A Foreign Office spokesman said : "" We have longstanding concerns at the support that Iran provides to groups undermining peace in the Middle East through violence , including the activities of this group . ""
But western diplomats played down the significance of the group 's threat , saying it was primarily a campaign to gather signatures of protest against Israel rather than recruiting bombers .
But the group 's pronouncements add to the list of western indictments against Iran since the election last year of Mr Ahmadinejad , who has called for Israel to be wiped off the face of the Earth .
While the committee claims to be independent it has previously been linked with the Revolutionary Guards .
It claims it has gathered 52,000 recruits - of whom 30 % are women - since forming two years ago .
According to the group , recruits are instructed in target planning and military discipline before progressing to intensive urban guerrilla warfare training , involving the use of bomb belts .
When asked how Iranian volunteers would get into Israel , Mr Samadi cited the precedent of Asif Mohammed Hanif and Omar Sharif , two British Muslims who attacked a bar in Tel Aviv , killing three Israelis , in 2003 after entering Israel as tourists and then posing as peace activists .
Hanif blew himself up at the scene while Sharif fled , but was found drowned in the Mediterranean . ""
That shows that it has not been difficult getting into Israel , "" he said .
"" Do you think getting hold of a British passport for an Iranian citizen is hard ?
Tens of passports are issued for Iranian asylum seekers in Britain every day .
There are hundreds of other ways available to us , such as illegal entry [ into Britain ] , fake passports , etc . ""
Britain and other European countries have a lot of disaffected Muslims who are ready .
We understand the suspicion with which Britain , America and other western countries regard their Muslim populations .
We do n't condemn them for this because we believe every Muslim has the potential to turn into a bomb against the west . ""
Mr Samadi said recruits would not be told to attack British cities . ""
With the exception of Israel , we do not target civilians , "" he said .
"" They would definitely not be sent to carry out an attack on London unless it was to kill Salman Rushdie . ""
Israeli security analysts said there is no evidence that the group has been directly linked to suicide bombings or other attacks in Israel .
Israel 's ambassador to the UN , Dan Gillerman , in a security council debate about Monday 's Tel Aviv bombing , called Iranian threats against Israel a "" declaration of war "" ."
2006-04-19,"Internal political divisions and economic weaknesses may present a bigger threat to the longevity of the Iranian government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad than the US and Israeli air forces combined , a report published yesterday suggests .
The study , entitled Understanding Iran and produced by the Foreign Policy Centre , warns that military action against Iran 's suspect nuclear facilities could have disastrous consequences .
"" The only chance of modifying Iran 's behaviour in the short term will come from a serious effort to engage with the current leadership , "" it says .
Echoing calls for direct US - Iran talks made by Germany , the UN 's nuclear agency , and US politicians , the European thinktank 's report urges the creation of a Middle East security organisation similar to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe .
It proposes mechanisms for facilitating dialogue to end the nuclear impasse and address other friction points .
But in suggesting increased "" economic , cultural , educational and social exchanges as a way of empowering the Iranian people and ultimately forcing the regime to loosen its restrictive practices "" it also highlights the potentially fatal schisms and vulnerabilities of a government often portrayed as united in defiance of the west . ""
Behind the scenes a fierce struggle is under way .
In one camp is President Ahmadinejad , his supporters in the Revolutionary Guards and the paramilitary force known as the Basijis , and messianic fundamentalists inspired by the teachings of Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi Mesbah - Yazdi .
In the other camp is Iran 's embattled democratic movement [ and ] an array of forces that benefited from the status quo before Ahmadinejad came to power , including former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani . ""
The outcome of this battle was uncertain , but what was clear was that direct US intervention would play into the hands of the hardliners . ""
A strategy that gambles on a popular uprising to bring down the current regime runs the risk of undermining those very forces it purports to want to help . ""
The report looks at other pressures on the government : a population of over 70 million , of whom 65 % are younger than 25 ; a largely state - dominated economy prone to corruption ; an energy industry starved of investment that is producing steadily less oil for export , and a youth culture increasingly circumventing controls on foreign media and internet access . '
According to the government 's own estimates some 900,000 new jobs are needed annually to accommodate the burgeoning labour force and prevent an increase in unemployment , officially at 16 % , unofficially at over 20 % , "" the report says .
It also focuses on gender discrimination , human rights abuses ( including executions of minors and repression of minorities ) , and attempts to suppress free speech and independent media .
All these contentious issues , it suggests , carry the seeds of change from within and in the longer term could be catalysts for ending Iran 's post-1979 theocracy .
But if the west was to understand Iran , it had to understand itself - and recognise that clumsy outside attempts to jump - start reform were likely to be counterproductive ."
2006-04-19,"Iran 's Islamic authorities are preparing a crackdown on women flouting the stringent dress code in the clearest sign yet of social and political repression under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
From today police in Tehran will be under orders to arrest women failing to conform to the regime 's definition of Islamic morals by wearing loose - fitting hijab , or headscarves , tight jackets and shortened trousers exposing skin .
Offenders could be punished with £ 30 fines or two months in jail .
Officers will also be authorised to confront men with outlandish hairstyles and people walking pet dogs , an activity long denounced as un - Islamic by the religious rulers .
The clampdown coincides with a bill before Iran 's conservative - dominated parliament proposing that fines for people with TV satellite dishes rise from £ 60 to more than £ 3,000 .
Millions of Iranians have illegal dishes , enabling them to watch western films and news channels .
The dress purge is led by a Tehran city councillor , Nader Shariatmaderi , a close ally of Mr Ahmadinejad who helped to plot last year 's election victory .
Loosely arranged headscarves - exposing glamourous hairstyles - and shorter , tight - fitting overcoats ( manteaus ) became a symbol of the social freedoms that flourished under the reformist presidency of Mohammed Khatami .
During his election campaign , Mr Ahmadinejad dismissed fears that his presidency might herald a forced reversal , saying Iran had more urgent problems .
However , Mr Shariatmaderi denounced the trends as "" damaging to revolutionary and Islamic principles "" .
"" We are looking for a social utopia to live in but in the last couple of months , our attention has wavered , "" he told fellow councillors .
"" In the present international situation , people must unite under known principles .
"" The clampdown recalls the aftermath of the 1979 Islamic revolution , when women wearing lipstick were often confronted by female vigilantes wiping their faces clean with handkerchiefs , which were said to often conceal razor blades .
The new campaign will hold taxi agencies accountable for their passengers ' attire , police will be able to impound cabs carrying women dressed "" inappropriately "" .
Agencies guilty of repeat offences will be closed .
Police have reportedly been stopping women motorists recently whose hijab was judged inadequate .
Police have also raided fashion stores and seized brightly coloured manteaus .
Tehran 's police chief , Morteza Talai , said the campaign would try to clamp down on people making "" the social environment insecure "" .
Young women shopping in north Tehran 's fashionable Tajrish neighbourhood yesterday , however , were uncowed .
Matin , 24 , a nurse , was wearing a gaudily patterned light - blue head scarf pushed back to reveal sunglasses and bleached blond hair .
Her tight , short black manteau with intricate gold patterns seemed designed to provoke the ire of the authorities .
But she was unrepentant .
"" I 'm a married woman and it should be my husband who tells me what and what not to wear .
He likes the way I dress , "" she said .
Surprisingly , Narges Asgari , 20 , a dressmaker wearing an all - encompassing black chador , was also critical .
"" I do n't think people will listen because they want to take decisions themselves , "" she said .
"" Clothes depend on the culture of their families .
I wear the chador because , in my family , it 's something we accept . """
2006-04-24,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has announced that women will be allowed to attend football matches in big stadiums for the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
Under a decree reported on state television yesterday , the president has ordered the head of the country 's sports organisation to provide separate areas for women . ""
The best stands should be allocated to women and families in the stadiums in which national and important matches are being held , "" Mr Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying .
The reason given by the president seems to have been intended to placate hardliners . ""
The presence of women and families in public places promotes chastity , "" he said .
Women have occasionally scuffled with police when barred from entering stadiums , although now and then they have been allowed into smaller venues to watch sports such as basketball or volleyball .
They have also tried to go inside venues disguised as men or have sneaked in with the supporters of foreign teams .
Last month security forces attacked dozens of female football fans who had bought tickets for a match at the Azadi stadium in Tehran .
They briefly unfurled protest banners and staged a demonstration outside before being forced into a bus and driven away .
A few days later some 250 female spectators at a gymnastics world cup event in Tehran were escorted from an indoor stadium .
At a time when the Iran is facing international pressures over its nuclear programme , the president 's move may be an attempt to defuse one of the most divisive issues inside the country .
On Sunday he also seemed to back - track on a move to tighten up on women 's dress codes by saying his government would not use strongarm tactics .
Since Mr Ahmadinejad won the presidency last year with the backing of conservative clerics and Basij religious militias hardliners have been pressing for tighter controls on "" immoral behaviour "" ."
2006-04-24,"Iran 's nuclear programme is the biggest threat to Jews since the Nazi Holocaust , the Israeli government stated yesterday , as the Iranian president renewed his calls for the dissolution of the Jewish state .
As Israel prepared to mark Holocaust memorial day , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the Iranian president , further stirred international outrage by calling on Israeli Jews to be resettled in Europe .
"" Some 60 years have passed since the end of the second world war .
Why should the people of Germany and Palestine pay now for a war in which the current generation was not involved ? ""
Mr Ahmadinejad said during a Tehran press conference .
"" This fake regime can not logically continue to live . ""
With international tension mounting over Iran 's nuclear plans and its defiance of the UN security council , the outgoing Israeli defence minister , Shaul Mofaz , told a Tel Aviv conference that the world had to act to stop Iran acquiring nuclear weapons .
He was speaking following the conclusion of a two - year Israeli government - ordered study of the nuclear threat from Iran , which warned that the existence of an Iranian bomb would trigger a nuclear arms race in the Middle East .
Israel itself is a nuclear power and its refusal to discuss its nuclear options is constantly used by the Iranians to justify their nuclear programmes - though they insist they are purely peaceful .
Mr Ahmadinejad warned for the first time yesterday that Iran could quit the nuclear non - proliferation treaty , clearing the way for it to follow North Korea down the path of building a nuclear bomb without regard for international treaties .
The head of the UN nuclear authority , Mohamed ElBaradei , is to report on Iran 's nuclear projects to the UN security council by this Friday , setting the scene for the next escalation in the nuclear dispute .
Dr ElBaradei is certain to deliver a negative verdict to New York as Tehran has accelerated its nuclear activities radically in the past month , disregarding repeated demands that it freeze the key activities .
Tehran announced this month that it was effectively a nuclear power as it had managed to enrich uranium - and thus master the basic technologies needed to manufacture the fuel for nuclear reactors and also the fissile material required for nuclear warheads .
The Iranian president clearly timed his remarks to pre - empt the ElBaradei report and to up the ante in the showdown with Washington , where talk of war with Iran gets louder by the week . ""
Working in the framework of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and the [ international atomic energy ] agency is our concrete policy , "" the Iranian leader said .
"" But if we see that they are violating our rights , or they do n't want to accept [ our rights ] , well , we will reconsider . ""
Dr ElBaradei 's report this week will be crucial to deciding the next international moves on the Iranian nuclear crisis .
However , the American push to move swiftly towards punitive sanctions is being stymied by stiff Russian and Chinese opposition in the security council .
While many will find the Iranian leader 's remarks on Israel deeply offensive , some Israeli analysts believe the bellicose rhetoric is aimed mainly at shoring up his own uncertain powerbase .
The US administration has declared Iran under Mr Ahmadinejad its biggest international challenge , and the Israelis are even more alarmed .
But Mr Mofaz emphasised the need for diplomatic rather than military action against Iran . ""
Of all the threats we face , Iran is the biggest .
The world must not wait .
It must do everything necessary on a diplomatic level in order to stop its nuclear activity .
Since Hitler we have not faced such a threat , "" said the Israeli minister , who was himself born in Iran ."
2006-04-27,"That 's what Moqtada al - Sadr wants to know .
While Iranian clerics fume over President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's decision to allow female spectators at football matches , their co - religionist in Iraq is more concerned with why anyone would waste their time with the game at all .
Iraq the Model reveals the radical Shia cleric 's views on the beautiful game .
It is not clear when his comments were made , but the tone of them makes it unlikely that either the prospect of an Arsenal versus Barcelona Champion 's League final or "" Big Phil "" Scolari taking on the England job would do much to sway him .
Football - according to Iraq the Model 's translation - has done little but distract Arab minds while , Mr Sadr suggests , the US and Israel "" mostly turned to scientific things "" .
He explains : "" The west made things for us that distract us ... made us run after a ball , habibi . ""
The cleric asks what it means to "" see a man , big tall and wide and Muslim "" run after a ball ( clearly , he is no fan of soon - to - retire Zinedine Zidane ) .
He suggests the goals a believer pursues should be those that "" reach for the satisfaction of almighty Allah "" .
Mr Sadr then delivers the thrust of his argument - that Arabs would do better if they wasted less time on football .
The Jews , have you seen them play football ?
Ever seen them indulge in games like others indulge and the Arabs indulge ?
They left us to waste time of football and other things [ ... ]
Ever heard the Israeli team , something be upon it , damn be upon it , reached , for example , or took the World Cup ?
Or even America , habibi !
[ ... ] They left us to do forbidden things and they mostly turned to scientific things and thingy things .
Why , habibi ?
Are they better than us ?
No , we are better than them .
One wonders whether , if you presented Mr Sadr with the US 's participation in this year 's World Cup in Germany 2006 ( Israel came third in their qualifying group ) he would reconsider some of his argument .
Perhaps not .
Swimming , horse riding and fencing are the sort of leisure pursuits he prefers .
"" I mean , "" he asks in conclusion , "" must you run after a ball ? """
2006-04-28,"The Simon Wiesenthal centre yesterday called on Germany to ban the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , from attending the World Cup , describing his possible presence at the tournament as "" mind - boggling "" .
The Jewish human rights organisation said it had written to Sepp Blatter , the president of Fifa , football 's ruling body , urging him to bar Mr Ahmadinejad from the tournament , which begins in June .
Allowing him in would be tantamount to endorsing the 1936 Olympic games hosted by Hitler , the centre said .
"" President Ahmadinejad has forfeited his right to attend the World Cup .
He has endorsed genocide against Israel , vilified the Jewish people , and labelled the Nazi Holocaust and the murder of six million innocent men , women and children a myth , "" Marvin Hier and Abraham Cooper , two rabbis at the centre based in New York and Jerusalem , said .
Jewish leaders in Germany have already called for Mr Ahmadinejad to be banned following comments last year in which he called for Israel to be "" wiped off the map "" .
Under German law he could be arrested for Holocaust denial .
It is not clear whether Mr Ahmadinejad , a keen football fan , wants to visit Germany .
But Iranian football officials have said it is "" entirely possible "" that their president could turn up .
Iran plays its first match against Mexico on June 11 .
Fifa has resisted calls to ban Iran or its president , insisting that there is a strict distinction between politics and sport ."
2006-04-28,"It was absolutely predictable that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad would reject any UN security council strictures on Iran 's nuclear programmes , and equally predictable that former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani would speak of the need for talks .
It is also predictable that the security council members will find it hard to agree on what kind of pressures are now appropriate , given Iran 's failure to meet the most recent set of requirements .
A long game is under way in Iranian and world politics , and has been since well before Ahmadinejad discovered that the combination of nuclear big talk , attacking Israel and casting doubts on the Holocaust was a way of maintaining his popularity inside the country and raising his profile in the Arab world .
His rhetoric has obscured the fact that many Iranians are unattracted by the idea of the country possessing nuclear weapons , but it may also be changing some Iranian minds .
The Iranian president , whose powers are limited in Iran 's peculiar form of government , is working to enlarge his power base .
Those who helped him into the presidency , including supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , had not quite planned for it to come out this way .
While they had certainly not wanted to give up Iran 's nuclear options , they had probably envisaged a much less confrontational approach , with the possibility in mind of reaching a broad agreement with the United States under which Washington would give up any ideas of regime change .
Rafsanjani , the rival for the presidency whose bid was upset by the Ahmadinejad candidacy , is expressing a more nuanced view on nuclear issues that is probably shared by Khamenei .
It is a marker , too , that can be recalled if and when Ahmadinejad brings down serious troubles on Iran 's head in ways that affect ordinary people .
After all , although Iran is a country with a nuclear programme , it is also a country whose aircraft are falling out of the sky through lack of American spare parts .
And it is accustomed these days to a generous flow of consumer goods from outside .
Broader sanctions could hurt .
The United States will now expect Russia and China to stop prevaricating .
They in turn may say that it would be foolish to force an Iranian departure from the nuclear non - proliferation treaty , when there is still time - perhaps quite a lot of time , given some estimates of the obstacles that have to be overcome before Iran could produce nuclear weapons - for further negotiations .
My own starting point on the big question , of how dangerous a nuclear armed Iran would be , is that weapons do n't make wars .
Confrontations make wars , and what also makes for war is change , which rattles countries and clouds their judgment .
And we are at a point of huge change in the Middle East .
We may be coming to the end of the time when America has been by far the most important outside power in the region .
Hu Jintao has been in Riyadh this week .
Energy relationships are changing .
China and India are now seriously involved in the region .
Those two powers and Russia , taken together , constitute a balance to American power that was not there before , including in Soviet days .
By invading Iraq , the United States has created new uncertainty and instability in the heart of the region - a big country in possibly long - term trouble .
Al - Qaida , by challenging the United States as well as local regimes and by , in a sense , precipitating the Iraq invasion , has been a catalyst .
America will not cease to be powerful in the area , but it will be less powerful .
Iranian strength and leverage has been growing , while American anxieties have been increasing .
Anxiety in Washington , a mixture of new confidence and new fears in Tehran , make for a dangerous mixture .
There can be no denying that Iranian nuclear weapons would be a bad development , bad for Iran , bad for the region , and bad for the world .
But it is important to ask how bad .
Is Iran , simply by becoming a more important country , with more money , more influence , and more military strength to be deemed an intolerable threat ?
Surely such shifts in relative power are part of history , to be accommodated rather than opposed by wise nations .
What about the uses to which Iran could put nuclear weapons ?
Apart from the fact that most existing nuclear powers would probably ruefully agree that such weapons have been of little use , the specifics in Iran 's case suggest the consequences could be quite limited .
•
Could Iran dominate its neighbours because it had nuclear weapons ?
Given Iran 's religious and ethnic differences with most of them , there will always be constraints on its influence , even as it grows in strength and wealth .
•
Might it set off a nuclear arms race with those neighbours ?
Same answer , with the additional argument that American and western leverage on the countries that might follow an Iranian example , like Turkey , Egypt and Saudi Arabia is much greater than the leverage on Iran .
•
Could it attack Israel ?
If it did , Iran would be vaporising the very Palestinians it would be purporting to save , as well as guaranteeing that Tehran would be obliterated .
There are limits to irrationality .
•
Would it attack the United States and Europe , either directly or by giving weapons to terrorists ?
Even in the latter case , Iran would have no immunity to counter attack .
•
Would it allow the obstruction of western purposes and , in an extreme situation , deter an American military attack on Iran ?
Yes , but this is something we simply have to live with .
Other countries see things differently , want different things .
Sometimes they will get their way , and we do n't have to invest such differences with some vast moral weight .
The feelers Iranian leaders have put out over the years suggest that the regime has been at least intermittently interested in a settlement with America .
The last serious effort , according to Flynt Leverett , formerly adviser on Middle East affairs to the US national security council , was in early 2003 .
It was ignored by the Bush administration .
Fair to say that if the Americans have been unresponsive , the Iranians have sometimes been elusive .
The rhetoric of the previous president , Mohammad Khatami , suggested more than it ever delivered .
Iran is a threat to is the unusual degree of power and influence possessed by the United States and Israel in the region .
But has that preponderant influence been all that good for the people concerned , including the Israelis ?
Iran is a case of what happens when rising powers bump into established powers .
It is a situation that calls for cool heads on all sides , as the nations feel their way to a new balance ."

Gholamreza Aghazadeh , head of Iran 's nuclear industry , said Iran had enriched uranium to 4.8 % a month after the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , revealed scientists had enriched it to 3.6 % .
Uranium enrichment to much higher levels is essential for a nuclear weapons capability .
Britain and France , backed by the US , put forward a draft resolution that would make it mandatory for Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment programme .
If Iran failed to comply , they could impose sanctions .
The 15-member council , as expected , broke up without agreement .
The draft resolution includes a deadline .
This would involve Mohamed El- Baradei , head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , the UN watchdog , being asked again by the security council to report on whether Iran had suspended its uranium nuclear programme .
Foreign ministers from the US , Britain , France , Germany , Russia and China are to meet over dinner in New York on Monday to try to reach consensus .
Russia and China are worried the resolution will be used as a fast track to sanctions .
They are opposed to sanctions , at least at this stage .
At a meeting with the US and Europeans in Paris on Tuesday , Russia and China said there was nothing in a report from Mr ElBaradei to the security council last Friday to justify a move to sanctions .
Angela Merkel , the German chancellor , flew to Washington last night for talks today with President George Bush on Iran .
John Bolton , US ambassador to the UN , said on Tuesday that if the security council could not agree on a resolution , the US and its European allies could go it alone on sanctions ."
2006-05-08,"Yesterday 's letter from Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to George Bush , the first such publicly announced communication since the 1979 Iranian revolution , may represent a tentative but significant first step towards direct talks with the US .
Given the high level of international concern over Iran 's nuclear activities and the possible American response to them , that could make it one of the more important missives to land on the White House doormat in recent years .
But it is equally possible that Iran , facing growing diplomatic isolation , is attempting to exploit divisions within the US and the UN security council over the nuclear issue .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's vague but tantalising offer to seek "" new solutions "" to international problems may stiffen Russian and Chinese opposition to the potentially fateful UN resolution the US , Britain and France hope to pass this week .
The Iranians will certainly have noted the lengthening procession of senior Republicans urging the Bush administration to swallow its prejudices , stop working through European proxies , and talk directly to Tehran .
John McCain , Mr Bush 's rival for the Republican nomination in 2000 and a likely presidential candidate in 2008 , added his voice at the weekend .
Direct talks were "" an option you probably have to consider "" , he said .
Richard Lugar , the Republican chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee , has proposed that Iran join a dialogue on energy and security with India , China , the US and other countries .
It was too soon to press for UN sanctions , he told ABC television .
"" I believe for the moment we ought to cool this one . ""
Despite accusations of appeasement from neo - cons , pressure on the US to talk rather than threaten has also come from Richard Armitage , the deputy secretary of state in Mr Bush 's first term , Kofi Annan , the UN secretary - general , and Mohamed ElBaradei , the UN nuclear chief .
Mr Bush has ignored such calls so far , relying in part on the dangled threat of military action to influence Tehran .
Limited US talks with Iran on Iraq have yet to begin .
But impatience tinged with alarm over the dangers inherent in the impasse is also building in western Europe .
"" There is a growing feeling on the European side that the US needs to get involved and broaden the agenda , "" one diplomat said , adding that the Americans were being privately pressed to change tack .
Germany , where opposition to US military action is strongest , has publicly urged talks .
Mr Bush 's formal response to Mr Ahmadinejad 's letter will be crucial .
The temptation will be to view it as a sign of weakness and rebuff it , as happened in May 2003 when Tehran proposed unconditional , comprehensive talks .
That offer , conveyed as now via Swiss diplomats , received no response from a White House buoyed by the fall of Baghdad .
But Mr Bush was far stronger , politically and militarily , then than now .
A generation of enmity , sharp ideological differences , and personal distaste will be weighed against pragmatic considerations .
Flat rejection will be interpreted by Tehran and others as confirmation that the US is using the nuclear issue as a lever for regime change .
Asked whether the letter signalled a policy shift , a Tehran source said : "" When you write a letter to someone , you expect to get a reply .
Maybe it 's good news . ""
But the situation in Tehran was "" extremely political , extremely sensitive "" .
Very little was required to tip it back into confrontation ."
2006-05-09,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the Iranian president , sent a letter yesterday to George Bush - the first such communication for 27 years - offering an analysis of global issues and "" new ways of getting out of the current delicate situation in the world "" .
The US last night rejected the letter as having no relevance .
A US state department spokesman said : "" Nothing in the letter addresses the issues on the table between Iran and the world , whether on the nuclear issue , terrorism or human rights . ""
He added : "" Instead , it is a broad historical , philosophical exposition . ""
The 18-page letter , which did not directly mention the nuclear dispute but ranges over issues such as the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , came as the foreign ministers of the US , Britain , France , Germany , Russia and China met in New York to discuss tabling a United Nations security council resolution against Iran .
The meeting marked the international debut of Margaret Beckett , the new foreign secretary .
She met Condoleezza Rice , the US secretary of state , for a one - on - one at the Waldorf hotel before sitting down to dinner with representatives from France , Germany , Russia and China .
After meeting Ms Rice , Mrs Beckett made her first public comment as foreign secretary : "" I am delighted to be here . ""
She said she had heard so much about Ms Rice from her predecessor , Jack Straw , who enjoyed a strong rapport with his US counterpart , that "" I feel as if I know you already "" .
Ms Rice said they had compared backgrounds and how they had risen to their present positions in politics .
Mrs Beckett , still getting up to speed , had no public comment on Iran , while Ms Rice reiterated that the international community had to send a clear message that it could not develop a nuclear weapon .
Security council members are considering a British - French resolution , backed by the US , threatening punitive measures unless Iran abandons uranium enrichment .
The west suspects the processing is aimed at making a bomb , but Tehran denies this .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's letter was the first official communication from an Iranian president to his US counterpart since the 1979 Islamic revolution and the Tehran embassy siege , when 52 US diplomats were held hostage for 14 months .
Iranian officials would not give details of the contents of the letter , delivered through the Swiss embassy in Tehran , which handles US interests .
A government spokesman , Gholam Hossein Elham , said : "" He has given an analysis of the current world situation , and of new ways of getting out of the current delicate situation . ""
The letter 's disclosure came a day after Iran 's parliament wrote to the UN secretary - general , Kofi Annan , threatening withdrawal from the nuclear non - proliferation treaty ( NPT ) if the security council adopts a resolution allowing for economic sanctions or military action ."
2006-05-10,"The Russian president , Vladimir Putin , today compared the US to a wolf who "" eats without listening "" as a public spat between the two countries on the best way to deal with Iran intensified .
Washington and Moscow are split on the appropriate action to take against Iran following the announcement last month from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that the country had mastered uranium enrichment .
Russia has made clear that it agrees Iran should not have nuclear weapons but questions whether the country is actively seeking a bomb and whether sanctions would be effective .
Responding for the first time to accusations last week by the US vice - president , Dick Cheney , that Moscow had rolled back democracy , Mr Putin said : "" Where is all this pathos about protecting human rights and democracy when it comes to the need to pursue their own interests ? ""
Here , it seems , everything is allowed ; there are no restrictions whatsoever .
We are aware what is going on in the world .
Comrade wolf knows whom to eat , he eats without listening , and he 's clearly not going to listen to anyone . ""
In an apparent reference to suspicions that the US is planning military action against Iran , Mr Putin added : "" Methods of force rarely give the desired result , and often their consequences are even more terrible than the original threat .
"" Iran is under pressure from the US and the EU to rein in its nuclear programme .
Iran insists the project is for peaceful purposes , but some countries fear its aim is to develop weapons .
Mr Ahmadinejad today called western governments ' concern over his nuclear programme a "" big lie "" .
Speaking on a visit to Indonesia , the Iranian leader said the countries that criticised Iran 's nuclear project were themselves involved in nuclear activities that were "" expanding day by day "" .
"" They test the new brands of weapons of mass destruction every day .
Big powers pretend [ they ] are concerned , but it 's a big lie , "" he said .
Indonesia , the world 's most populous Muslim country , has offered to help mediate in the dispute over Iran 's nuclear aspirations .
"" We can cooperate well in reducing the tension and move toward continuing talks and negotiations , "" said the Indonesian president , Susilo Yudhoyono .
A spokesman for the Indonesian government said Tehran had been "" very receptive "" to its offer .
Jusuf Kalla , vice - president of Indonesia , told reporters after meeting Mr Ahmadinejad that Indonesia supported nuclear programmes for peaceful use .
The official purpose of Mr Ahmadinejad 's visit to Jakarta is the development of closer economic ties .
Iran is in the process of investing billions of dollars in the Indonesian oil and gas sector .
Both nations are members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and are keen to boost trade with one another .
The US has pushed for international action on Iran and , with China and Russia , has authorised Britain , France and Germany to draw up a plan to persuade its government to relinquish its nuclear enrichment programme ."
2006-05-11,"The Bush administration 's blanket rejection of Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's letter may prove to be a serious tactical mistake .
It 's true that the Iranian president made no substantive proposals .
He referred only obliquely to the nuclear stand - off with the US and its western allies .
He did not offer to talk about other stated American concerns such as his hostility to Israel , Iran 's behaviour in Iraq , and its support for groups such as Lebanon 's Hezbullah .
It is also true that Mr Ahmedinejad 's meandering and rhetorical criticisms of American policy hardly represented an inducement to the Americans to talk .
His tone invited a rebuff - and it was duly delivered by Condoleezza Rice , the US secretary of state , backed by President Bush .
But after 27 years of almost unbroken non - communication in any meaningful , official sense , the letter was first and foremost a symbolic gesture and should have been treated as such .
It gained added importance because it came from an Islamist hardliner who has been outspoken in his criticism of Washington 's policies .
Despite being short on substance , it reinforced the impression that Iran does not want a confrontation with the west and is tentatively looking for ways out of the current impasse .
Comments by senior Iranian officials , including Hassan Rowhani , the country 's former top nuclear negotiator , further indicate that policy divisions within Iran 's ruling circles persist .
Mr Rowhani is a close confidant of the Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who is notably less aggressive in his comments on relations with the west .
Washington 's flat rejection of the letter could strengthen hardliners inside the government who oppose any negotiation .
International perceptions of the exchanges over the letter are also important .
Mr Ahmadinejad was feted in Jakarta yesterday as a sort of Islamic hero at the start of a visit to Indonesia .
By appearing to show flexibility , in contrast to President Bush , the Iranian leader sends a message around the Muslim world that he is a reasonable and right - minded person worthy of support .
He too is intent on building a "" coalition of the willing "" .
In Europe , too , Mr Bush 's refusal to talk directly to the Iranians is seen as increasingly hard to understand .
The idea that Iran 's regime is some uniquely evil construct that should not be countenanced , unlike the Soviet governments of the Cold War era or the current North Korean regime , will not wash .
Europeans find American militarism scary - and in the wake of the Iraq fiasco , threatening to their own security .
Speculation about a US attack on Iran only adds to that unease .
Before the neo - cons and their supporters start whingeing , this is not an argument for appeasement .
It is a common sense concern that says that all reasonable steps must be taken to resolve a given problem that affects us all .
Petulantly and scornfully rejecting Mr Ahmadinejad 's clumsy approaches is not a mature way of proceeding .
This should not be Washington 's last word ."
2006-05-11,"There is much in common between Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's recent letter to US President George W Bush and the missive that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran , addressed to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in January 1987 .
In his epistle to the Kremlin 's top official , Khomeini argued that western capitalism had failed , and that communism would soon be relegated to museums , a prescient comment which has been almost universally overlooked by non - Iranian historians .
The Ayatollah then urged atheist Gorbachev to study Islam and - true to his calling as a theological teacher - recommended several books on the subject .
In an uncanny parallel , Ahmadinejad concludes his 3,900-word letter with the statement that both liberalism and western style democracy have been unable to "" help realize the ideals of humanity "" in the post - Cold War era .
Noting the surge in religious belief around the globe , he declares that "" through faith in God and the teachings of the prophets , the people will solve their problems "" .
Going by Ahmadinejad 's earlier references to Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , Ishmael , Moses , Joseph and Jesus Christ - followed in each case by PBUH ( Peace Be Upon Him ) - it is obvious that the term "" prophets "" means the prophets of the monotheistic faiths .
If nothing else , Ahmadinejad 's rhetorical question in the penultimate paragraph to Bush - "" Do you not want to join them [ those flocking around God ] ? "" - deserves an answer from a born - again Christian .
Bush could simply tell his Iranian counterpart : "" On this subject , I am waiting for a word from God "" .
Since Bush is on record saying , "" God told me to strike at Al Qaida and I struck them , and then He instructed me to strike at Saddam , which I did . "" - his statement will likely be taken seriously in Tehran .
Besides the content and style of the Iranian president 's letter - which must have been cleared by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamanei - one should consider its timing and its underlying motive .
The missive was timed to coincide with the meeting of the foreign ministers of the permanent five members of the United Nations Security Council in New York .
It clearly illustrated Tehran 's willingness to talk to the White House .
It therefore strengthened the hands of the Russian and Chinese foreign ministers who are opposed to any resolution on Iran under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter which opens the way for sanctions and military action against Tehran .
Ahmadinejad 's ploy worked .
Russia and China refused to back the Anglo - French draft resolution invoking Chapter 7 .
By failing to respond to Tehran 's overture , Bush will be repeating the mistake he made in May 2003 .
At that time , according to Flynt Leverett , a former Director for Middle East Affairs at the US National Security Council , the Bush administration received a credible Iranian offer of comprehensive negotiations through its Interests Section at the Swiss Embassy in Tehran .
In the afterglow of his "" Mission Accomplished "" photo - op in his Top Gun uniform abroad USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier on May 1 , Bush never bothered to respond .
Unlike its previous initiative , which was taken in secret , this time the Iranian regime has made its move public .
Its gesture has gone down very well among Muslims both inside Iran and outside .
It has put Iran on a high moral ground and made it appear reasonable - with its hand stretched to make official contact with the United States - to Muslims worldwide .
Such is the political - cultural - diplomatic reality of the day .
The other equally important aspect of this reality is that the issues of the Israel - Palestine relations and the Anglo - American invasion of Iraq on false pretences , raised by Ahmadinejad in his letter , are of paramount interest and concern to the global Muslim community By turning a blind eye to these facts the Bush White House will stoke up its already high unpopularity in the Muslim world ."
2006-05-15,"The European Union will propose a "" bold package "" of incentives to Iran , including possible security guarantees , if Tehran can ensure that its nuclear programme is not used to produce weapons , the EU foreign - policy chief , Javier Solana , said today .
"" We have said over and over again that we think a diplomatic solution is a good way , and we are going to continue on that line
and ... we are going to prepare a very serious package that will make it difficult for them to say no , "" Mr Solana said ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers .
The proposals will be put together despite an announcement last night by Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , that any economic and political incentive package would be rejected if it required Tehran to stop enriching uranium .
Uranium enrichment can be a first step towards a nuclear weapons programme .
Insisting that only Iran has the authority to make decisions about its nuclear program , Mr Ahmadinejad said "" they want to offer us things they call incentives in return for renouncing our rights "" .
However , Mr Solana did not appear unduly worried by the Iranian president 's announcement .
"" It will be a generous package , a bold package , that will contain issues related to nuclear , and atomic matters and maybe necessary security matters , "" he told reporters .
"" We ... have nothing against Iran having nuclear capabilities , if it 's strictly devoted to the production of energy , [ and ] we have said that we would even be ready to cooperate with that . ""
"" What we think is not appropriate , not acceptable , is to take the other route which is not to produce energy , but to produce arms or weapons . ""
The British foreign secretary , Margaret Beckett , said there would be "" real advantages "" for Iran if it complied with the recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Tehran has repeatedly asserted that its nuclear program , which includes uranium enrichment , is purely civilian in character and aimed only at generating power .
But the United States , Israel and the EU fear the research programme is in fact a cover for the development of nuclear weapons .
Iran rejected a package of economic and political incentives offered by the EU last August in return for a permanent end to uranium enrichment , but EU governments have continued to offer sweeteners , as well as pushing at the United Nations for measures that could lead to sanctions if it refuses .
Meanwhile , the UN secretary - general , Kofi Annan , today called for urgent action on the Iranian nuclear crisis .
Mr Annan met the South Korean foreign minister , Ban Ki - moon , with whom he also discussed the North Korean nuclear standoff . ""
The international community has to take very urgent steps to deal with these issues before we have a cascade of a proliferation of nuclear weapons , "" Mr Annan said ."
2006-05-17,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has rejected European plans to build his country a nuclear reactor in return for it giving up its uranium enrichment programme .
In a hardline speech in the city of Arak , where Iran 's only existing nuclear reactor is being constructed , he mocked the plans being developed by the UK , France and Germany . ""
They say they want to offer us incentives , "" he said .
"" We tell them : keep the incentives as a gift for yourself .
We have no hope of anything good from you . ""
Do you think you are dealing with a four - year - old child to whom you can give some walnuts and chocolates and get gold from him ? ""
European diplomats yesterday raised the possibility of building a light water nuclear reactor for Iran , a proposal intended to allow the country to continue with its nuclear programme , while reducing the potential for weapons development .
Iran claims its nuclear programme , which boasts the heavy water reactor in Arak and a uranium enrichment facility in Isfahan , is only intended for peaceful purposes .
But both facilities can be used to develop material for nuclear bombs .
Heavy water reactors produce large amounts of plutonium as a by - product , and uranium enrichment plants can be used to enrich the radioactive material beyond the 3.5 % level used in power generation to the levels of 20 % or more that are needed to detonate atomic bombs .
The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed last week that Iran had succeeded in enriching uranium up to a level of 5 % .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's televised speech was made in front of a roaring crowd of supporters , who chanted : "" We love you Ahmadinejad . ""
His foreign ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi lampooned the European offer of incentives , making a joking reply offer to the EU countries .
"" We are prepared to offer economic incentives to Europe in return for recognising our right ( to enrich uranium ) , "" state radio quoted him as saying .
The stance is a change from Mr Ahmadinejad 's apparently conciliatory position last week , when he broke 26 years of official silence to send a letter to the US president , George Bush .
The move was widely interpreted as an attempt to open a dialogue , although the hectoring tone of the letter left Washington dismissing the move as an attempt to distract attention from Iran 's nuclear weapons development .
Iranian media reported yesterday that Mr Ahmadinejad was drafting a second letter to Mr Bush .
Wrangling over how to tackle Iran has put off talks between the US , Russia , China and the EU three , which were due to be held in London on Friday .
Russia and China favour the most conciliatory stance and Tehran has received favourably Russian proposals to provide it with enriched uranium for its power plants .
Both nations oppose taking UN action against Tehran 's flouting of a security council resolution ordering it to halt its uranium enrichment plant .
The EU three support imposing a UN resolution that could lead to sanctions or even military action , although only the US and Israel are thought to favour a pre - emptive strike on Iran 's nuclear facilities ."

2006-05-28,"The Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is uncertain about whether he will be following the national team in Germany .
Iran play Mexico in their first World Cup match on June 11 in Nuremberg .
"" My decision depends on a lot of different things , "" said Ahmadinejad , a noted football fan .
"" Whether I have time , whether I want to and some other things . ""
Ahmadinejad said he was unsurprised by the political debate about his possible visit to Germany after the German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble announced he would be welcome .
"" I was not at all surprised because there is a very active worldwide network of Zionists , also in Europe , "" said Ahmadinejad , who also stood by previous statements questioning the Holocaust and whose previous anti - Israeli remarks have led to comparisons with Adolf Hitler .
The former Tottenham and West Ham striker Sergei Rebrov will be fit for Ukraine 's World Cup campaign after tests on his injured thigh revealed the damage was not serious .
The 31-year - old sustained the injury in a training camp in Turkey but his coach Oleg Blokhin says he will be available in Germany .
"" There is nothing serious with Rebrov , "" said Blokhin .
"" I think he will train with the whole team again in five days . ""
Blokhin said that no one has yet been called up to replace Serhiy Fedorov , who has been ruled out through injury after being named in the original 23-man squad , and warned that his team will have to work hard at their training camp near Kiev .
"" I have warned all the players , "" he said .
"" Those who do not work as hard as they should will not go to Germany even though they are already registered .
I would rather go with 18 active players . ""
Spain made a lacklustre start to their World Cup preparations with a 0 - 0 draw against Russia on Saturday .
Luis Aragones 's side dominated the game but could not find a way past Alexander Borodyuk 's men .
Fernando Torres , David Villa and Liverpool 's Luis García began the game in attack in a 4 - 3 - 3 formation that Aragones has said he wants to employ in Germany .
The coach was satisfied with his team 's efforts but his opposite number questioned the Spanish attitude .
"" Spain are a very skilful team but I do n't think they have a winning mentality yet , "" said Borodyuk .
"" I did n't see that mentality in this match . ""
England crashing out of the World Cup early could lead to fewer crashes on the nation 's roads , according to figures from Churchill Car Insurance .
The company reviewed claims data from match days during Euro 2004 and found that road accidents increased 14 % right the way through the tournament .
Accident figures soared on England match days and shot up by 51.3 % on June 24 - the day Sven - Goran Eriksson 's side lost to Portugal on penalties .

2006-06-03,"Iran seemed finally to be backing away from a confrontation with America and Europe over its nuclear programme , as senior officials and politicians in Tehran said yesterday that proposals put forward last week might form the basis for negotiation .
State - run television reported that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had told UN Secretary - General Kofi Annan that a deal was feasible , provided Tehran kept a minimum right to atomic energy .
Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki added that he welcomed unconditional talks with all parties involved , including the United States . '
We think that , if there is goodwill , a breakthrough to get out of a situation [ the EU and US ] have created ... is possible , ' Mottaki told a press conference . '
We think the views we will present our partners could prepare the ground for a comprehensive understanding . '
However , Mottaki added that Iran would not cease uranium enrichment , a Western precondition for talks .
Last week 's diplomacy showed no signs of slowing this weekend .
The EU 's foreign affairs chief , Javier Solana , is due to arrive in Tehran today or tomorrow to hand over the most recent negotiating offer - the first backed by all major Western powers .
Details of the deal have not been made public , but it is believed to include massive assistance with a civilian nuclear programme and a series of major trade concessions .
If Iran rejects it , there is the possibility of sanctions , and eventually of military action .
There was no immediate reaction from the Foreign Office to the statements of Ahmadinejad and Mottaki , but the new line was privately welcomed by Western diplomats . '
It 's very early days
but hopefully it 's a vindication of our strategy , ' said one Paris - based diplomat .
Others , however , pointing out Iran 's labyrinthine command structure , said that comments from the president and the foreign minister might not be the last word . '
There 's a good chance that they are just playing for time , ' said one .
Others doubt the good faith of the Americans , who last week said they were prepared to negotiate directly with Iran for the first time in 27 years . '
The Americans have learnt the lessons of Iraq and are looking to build as broad an alliance as possible to give them the greatest possible room for manœuvre later on , ' said one analyst .
Iran announced in April that it had enriched uranium for the first time .
Enrichment can produce either fuel for a nuclear reactor or material for a warhead - but tens of thousands of centrifuges are needed to do either on a large scale .
Iran , which says it intends to move toward large - scale uranium enrichment by late 2006 , seems to have in effect reached the end of a period of massive advance and investment in its nuclear programme .
It may well be the case that scientists have advised the political leadership that a pause - during which negotiations could continue - would not cause a real delay .
Iran maintains that , as a signatory to the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty , it has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes - such as the production of reactor fuel - but has also occasionally indicated that it may suspend large - scale uranium enrichment if that helped to ease international tension ."
2006-06-08,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , said today he was ready to discuss "" mutual concerns "" over Tehran 's controversial nuclear programme , but warned that his country would not respond to threats .
Mr Ahmadinejad was making his first public comments since Iran received a new set of proposals backed by six world powers this week .
But he did not say whether he would accept a western package of incentives included in the proposals and aimed at enticing Tehran to suspend uranium enrichment .
"" The Iranian nation will never hold negotiations about its definite rights with anybody but we are for talks about mutual concerns to resolve misunderstandings in the international arena , "" he told thousands of people gathered at a rally in Qazvin , west of Tehran .
Iran 's initial reaction to the package - backed by Britain , the US , Russia , China , France and Germany , and presented by the EU foreign policy chief , Javier Solana - was relatively upbeat .
Tehran 's top nuclear negotiator , Ali Larijani , saying the proposals included "" positive steps "" and "" ambiguities that need to be cleared up "" .
But Iran has said it will only announce its position after carefully studying the package .
Mr Ahmadinejad told today 's crowd : "" International monopolists have been defeated in the face of your resistance and solidarity and have been forced to acknowledge your dignity and greatness . ""
Earlier the United States and Europe insisted that Iran permanently give up its uranium enrichment programme to allay fears that it may use it to build a nuclear bomb .
"" The Iranian nation will not retreat from the path of progress and obtaining advanced technology one iota , "" Mr Ahmadinejad said in his speech , which was broadcast live on state television .
Despite his tough talk , there was no indication that Mr Ahmadinejad was dismissing the western package .
Instead , he said dialogue should be fair and free from threats . ""
Negotiations should be held in a fair atmosphere and on the basis of equality .
If they [ America and its allies ] think they can threaten and hold a stick over Iran 's head and offer negotiations at the same time , they should know the Iranian nation will definitely reject such an atmosphere , "" he said .
His comments come after a major policy shift by the United States , when it agreed last week to join France , Britain and Germany in talks with Iran , provided Tehran suspended all suspect nuclear activities .
Britain urged Iran to accept the offer of talks .
Speaking at his monthly press conference today , Tony Blair said : "" I think all of us have felt that it is right now to come together and make a clear offer to Iran and say , ' We want to find a diplomatic solution to this , there is one on offer , you may want to develop civil nuclear power but we do not want a situation where that is used to threaten the outside world .

2006-06-08,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , boosted hopes of a breakthrough in the international standoff over his country 's suspected nuclear weapons programme yesterday by backing talks over "" mutual concerns and misunderstandings "" .
The Iranian president responded after it emerged that Washington would allow the Islamic regime to keep some capacity to enrich uranium if a deal was reached over its nuclear programme .
Europe and the US had previously insisted that Iran permanently cease uranium enrichment , a process that can be used to produce an atomic bomb .
That has now been diluted to a demand that it be suspended during renewed negotiations over an improved incentives package .
In a televised speech , Mr Ahmadinejad seized on the U - turn to claim a victory that put Iran in a powerful negotiating position : "" International monopolists have been defeated in the face of your resistance and solidarity and have been forced to acknowledge your dignity and greatness , "" he told an audience in the north - western city of Qazvin . ""
The Iranian nation will never hold negotiations about its definite rights with anybody , but we will talk about mutual concerns and solving misunderstandings in the international arena . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad hedged his offer with warnings that Iran would not surrender to threats .
He did not mention a UN incentives offer delivered to Tehran this week by the EU 's foreign policy chief , Javier Solana , as part of a possible deal .
But his endorsement of talks corresponded with the upbeat reception given the package by Iran 's chief nuclear negotiator , Ali Larijani , who has described it as "" positive "" and a basis for negotiations .
The speech echoed an 18-page letter Mr Ahmadinejad sent to George Bush last month , in which he lambasted American actions while calling for "" new solutions "" to global problems .
But as the Iranian leader was softening his stance , the UN nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna , reported that Tehran had begun a fresh phase of uranium enrichment .
IAEA chief Mohammed ElBaradei said in a report to his governing board that Iran was pressing ahead with installing more cascades of centrifuge enrichment machines .
The report said Iran resumed feeding "" UF6 "" uranium gas into its pilot 164-centrifuge cascade in Natanz on Tuesday after a pause of several weeks to do test runs of the machines without UF6 .
Analysts interpreted Mr Ahmadinejad 's latest comments as an attempt to influence Iran 's stance on the nuclear talks , over which the ultimate arbiter is the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
"" We are moving away from confrontation and the situation seems to be getting better step by step , "" said Saeed Leylaz , a Tehran - based analyst .
Mr Leylaz did not believe Mr Ahmadinejad made the ultimate decisions , however . ""
He is simply trying to influence the process .
I do n't believe uranium enrichment is an issue for the country .
Much more important are security guarantees , removal of sanctions and fair access to global markets , especially in technology and foreign investment .
If you resolve those points reaching agreement on uranium enrichment will be relatively easy . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad 's support for talks may undercut the position of one of his main political adversaries , the pragmatic former president Hashemi Rafsanjani .
Mr Rafsanjani , Iran 's leading advocate of detente with the west , was forced to abandon a speech in the holy city of Qom this week by religious radicals , who branded him an "" appeaser "" ."
2006-06-10,"Iran 's Football team will be met with a series of protests across Germany during their World Cup campaign as anger mounts against the country 's viciously anti - semitic President , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Senior politicians , Jewish groups and a prominent German TV host will join a demonstration today in Nuremberg hours before Iran play their opening match of the tournament against Mexico in the city .
They are furious that Ahmadinejad 's deputy , Mohammad Aliabadi , has been allowed into the country after the Iranian President called the Holocaust ' a fairytale ' and called for the destruction of Israel . '
Aliabadi has not distanced himself in any way from the statements that his President has made , ' said Sacha Stawski of pro - Israel group
Honestly Concerned , who are helping to organise today 's rally . '
It 's highly unlikely he thinks any differently .
Until he distances himself from the regime we will protest against him . '
Aliabadi went to Friday 's opening ceremony and first game in Munich and is due to watch his countrymen in their opening fixture in Group D in Nuremberg at 5 pm .
A cross - party group of German politicians is due to speak at the protest , including Gunter Beckstein , Bavaria 's right - wing Interior Minister , and Claudia Roth , the co - leader of Germany 's Green Party .
The country 's most famous Jewish TV personality , Michel Friedman , will also attend .
He has threatened to take legal action against Ahmadinejad if he comes to Germany , where Holocaust denial is a criminal offence .
Hundreds of Jewish people are expected at today 's event , with busloads arriving from Berlin , Munich and other cities .
Jewish leaders are comparing the presence of the Iran team and Aliabadi at the World Cup with the Berlin Olympics before the Second World War , when Adolf Hitler sought to use the Games to promote Aryan supremacy and his own leadership . '
Aliabadi 's presence means we could have a repeat of the 1936 Olympics , when they were hijacked by Hitler for his own political purposes and presentation , ' said Rene Pollak , chairman of the Zionist Federation of Frankfurt . '
We should have denied him entry to the country .
Western leaders should know by now that appeasing fascist regimes does not work . '
Opponents of the Tehran regime will also protest before Iran 's matches in Frankfurt against Portugal on Saturday and Angola in Leipzig four days later .
The demonstrations were arranged after German neo - Nazis said they intended to stage pro - Ahmadinejad welcoming parties in the three cities to show solidarity with Tehran because of its outspoken attacks on Jews and Israel .
However , many of the events have been banned by the police or the courts .
In addition , the NPD , Germany 's main far - right party , has also called off several rallies , after deciding not to risk tarnishing Germany 's image during the World Cup .
On Friday police raided the NPD 's Berlin offices and confiscated 3,000 ' racist ' World Cup guides , which target black players in Germany 's squad and warn of ' foreign infiltration ' .
Ahmadinejad , who is a keen football fan , may yet come to Germany if Iran confound predictions and reach the tournament 's knockout stages .
The team 's coach , Branko Ivankovic , has invited further controversy by saying that his players would be ' honoured ' to meet Ahmadinejad if he attends one of their games . '
This is nothing out of the ordinary .
It would be like Jacques Chirac coming to watch France , ' he said .
If Ahmadinejad does come , it will pose problems for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her government .
As Iran 's head of state , he would have to be treated as a VIP , but his presence would spark protests on a scale far larger than those already planned .
Charlotte Knobloch , the new president of Germany 's Central Jewish Council , said that , if Ahmadinejad came and repeated his remarks about the Holocaust , he should not be given any diplomatic immunity but instead be arrested ."
2006-06-15,"China ramped up its role as a global player on Thursday by hosting a summit of states encompassing almost half the world 's population and some of Washington 's most prominent opponents .
The Chinese president , Hu Jintao , said the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation - which brought together the leaders of 10 nations in and around central Asia - is designed to promote peace and stability in a region that has become an increasingly important source of oil and gas .
But the group 's potential role as a counterweight to the US was underlined by the presence of the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who received a warm welcome in Shanghai despite his country 's standoff with international nuclear inspectors over Tehran 's uranium enrichment program .
Mr Ahmadinejad said his country 's participation could "" turn the SCO into a strong , influential economic , political and trading institution at both regional and international levels and prevent the threats of domineering powers and their aggressive interference in global affairs "" .
The growing power of China has prompted a rethink in Washington , where rightwing analysts now speak of the SCO as an embryonic rival to Nato .
Their fears have been strengthened in the past two years by the inclusion in the SCO of Iran , Pakistan , India , Mongolia and Afghanistan as either observer or guest nations .
But it is in the field of energy that the SCO appears to be most powerful .
The countries gathered in Shanghai control almost a quarter of the world 's oil supplies and are building a series of pipelines across the region .
A pipeline is being planned from Iran to China that would cross Pakistan , whose president , Pervez Musharraf , yesterday requested to be admitted as a full member of the SCO .
Mr Ahmadinejad called for a meeting of SCO energy ministers to discuss closer cooperation in exploration , development and shipping . ""
The SCO groups both energy - producing nations and energy - consuming ones , "" he said .
"" Energy has been playing an increasing rule in national development and progress . ""
His comments are likely to rankle in Washington .
Last week the US defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , criticised China and Russia for backing Iran 's participation in the summit , saying he found it strange to bring the "" leading terrorist nation in the world into an organisation that says it 's against terror "" .
Participants dismissed fears that the SCO was a rival to the US .
"" Our actions are not aimed at the interests of other countries and do not signal the formation of another bloc , "" the president of Uzbekistan , Islam Karimov , said .
Chinese officials describe this week 's summit as their most important diplomatic event of the year .
An unprecedented security operation has shut down a large part of the usually bustling Pudong district near the conference centre and millions of the city 's residents have been given a special three - day holiday .
Such is the attention to detail that windows on part of the leaders ' route have been screwed shut and police have instructed locals not to leave flower pots on balcony ledges in case they fall .
The SCO - one of the world 's youngest international groupings - began life 10 years ago as a forum for settling border disputes between its core members : China , Russia and four Central Asian states - Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan and Uzbekistan .
Although its activities have expanded to cover anti - terrorism exercises , energy cooperation and banking in the five years since it became a formal institution in 2001 , most western commentators have dismissed the SCO as a dictators ' club that is long on style and short on substance .
On Thursday the leaders signed a joint statement on information security , economic cooperation and cross - border military exercises .
"" It remains the top priority of the organisation to combat the threats posed by terrorism , separatism and extremism as well as drug trafficking , which have not diminished but aggravated in scale and degree , "" the statement noted .
Human Rights Watch say the member countries use this as a pretext to crack down on legitimate and peaceful protests ."
2006-06-16,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , praised on Friday a six - nation incentive package aimed at resolving the international dispute over Tehran 's nuclear programme .
Raising hopes for a breakthrough , Mr Ahmadinejad said the package - which aims to curtail Iran 's uranium enrichment activities - was a "" step forward "" .
But despite the conciliatory tone of his comments , the president said his government had made no decision about whether to accept the proposal , which is backed by the US , Russia , China , France , Britain and Germany . ""
Generally speaking , we 're regarding this offer as a step forward
and I have instructed my colleagues to carefully consider it , "" he told reporters in Shanghai . ""
In due time they will give the response .
"" Under the package proposal , the EU has offered to provide trade and economic benefits to Iran in return for a halting of its nuclear programme .
On the table is also a transfer of peaceful nuclear technologies , airplane parts and support for Iran to join the World Trade Organisation .
The package is supported by the US , which believes that Iran is enriching uranium so that it can produce enough high - grade fissile material for warheads .
Last month , Washington offered Iran the first face - to - face talks between the two sides in more than 25 years , but it has also threatened to seek UN sanctions against Tehran if it continues its enrichment activities .
On Friday , the top US delegate to the International Atomic Energy Agency , Gregory Schulte , warned that if Iran rejected the incentives , it could face "" the weight of the security council "" .
Mr Ahmadinejad denied that his country 's nuclear program had a military application . ""
Sanctions should n't be used as a form of intimidation against countries of the world , "" he said .
The Iranian president is in Shanghai for a summit of central Asian nations , where he has taken the opportunity to press Tehran 's case with the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , and the Russian president , Vladimir Putin .
Both countries support the package and oppose US attempts to bring the issue to the security council .
After bilateral talks with Mr Ahmadinejad , Mr Putin said Iran has the right to nuclear technology if it poses no concern to the rest of the world .
Mr Hu said he had urged the Iranian president to accept the proposal .
Beijing is particularly keen to see a peaceful resolution of the dispute because Iran is the third biggest supplier of the crude oil that China needs to fuel its booming economy .
Whether Mr Ahmadinejad maintains his conciliatory tone after he leaves China remains to be seen .
Iran continues to send out mixed signals .
The country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , appeared to maintain a hardline approach in his latest reported comments . ""
The Islamic Republic of Iran will not succumb to these pressures , "" state television quoted Khamenei as saying ."
2006-06-16,"At the one day annual summit of the six - nation Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ) on June 15 , more limelight fell on the leader of an observer country than on any of the main participants .
That figure happened to be the controversial president of Iran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Despite the lowly observer status accorded to his country , Ahmadinejad went on to publicly invite the SCO members to a meeting in Tehran to discuss energy exploration and development in the region .
And the Russian president , Vladimir Putin , proposed that the SCO should form an "" energy club "" .
While making a plea that his country should be accorded full membership of the SCO , the Pakistani president , Parvez Musharraf , highlighted the geo - strategic position of his country as an energy and trade corridor for SCO members . ""
Pakistan provides a natural link between the SCO states to connect the Eurasian heartland with the Arabian Sea and South Asia , "" he said .
Given this , the old adage "" money talks "" ought to be modified to "" oil talks "" .
Founded in 1996 primarily to settle frontier problems between China and its post - Soviet neighbors - Russia , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , and Tajikistan - the SCO expanded three years later to include Uzbekistan , which does not share common borders with China or Russia , the two countries at the core of the SCO .
Since then SCO has developed as an organization concerned with regional security , thus focusing on counter - terrorism , defense , and energy cooperation .
Energy - hungry China has its eyes fixed on the large oil and gas reserves that Russia and Kazakhstan possess , and even the modest gas reserves of Uzbekistan .
Another energy - hungry mega - nation , India , which shares a disputed border with China , has been keen to join the group .
It has acquired a military base in Tajikistan , an SCO member .
And it has excellent relations with Russia .
It was with the joint backing of Russia and Tajikistan that India was accorded an observer status a year ago - along with Pakistan , Iran and Mongolia .
The declared aim of the SCO summit to pursue "" joint security , energy and development goals , including enhanced cooperation against terrorism , Islamist extremism and separatism "" resonates with India .
Equally significant was the summing up statement of the Chinese president , Hu Jinato , who chaired the meeting of 10 countries accounting for half of the human race , in Shanghai .
"" We hope the outside world will accept the social system and path to development independently chosen by our members and observers and respect the domestic and foreign policies adopted by the SCO participants in line with their national conditions , "" he said .
This was a short hand for non - interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states , a message the United States does not like to hear .
Little wonder that , Iran applied for full membership ; as did India .
Last year when the SCO accorded observer status to four countries , it rejected a similar request from the United States .
The reason is not far to guess .
The SCO is based on geographical contiguity .
Though Iran does not have common land frontiers with any of SCO members , it shares fluvial border with Russia and Kazakhstan in the Caspian Sea .
The US does not share borders with any of the SCO members .
The rising importance and coherence of the SCO worries Washington - as well as its closest Asian ally , Japan .
"" The SCO is becoming a rival block to the US alliance , "" said a senior Japanese official recently .
"" It does not share our values .
We are watching it very closely . """

Mohammad Atrianfar , the founder of the leading reformist newspaper Shargh and an ally of Hashemi Rafsanjani , the president 's rival , said Mr Ahmadinejad would not have it all his own way .
"" The reform movement is alive , despite last year 's defeat , "" he said .
Meanwhile , the government was mishandling economic policy , and that could be its undoing . ""
The present economy , due to the rate of oil prices , is in a good situation .
But the management of the state sector is very bad .
He has taken horrid and rushed decisions . ""
Mr Atrianfar said that oil revenue was being squandered through state handouts to impoverished provinces and commodity subsidies .
But there was insufficient investment in long - term projects and infrastructure , foreign investment was falling , and the country was suffering capital flight and a brain drain ."
2006-06-21,"When Mahmoud Ahmadinejad unexpectedly won the presidency last year , many Iranians concluded the brief era of tentative reform symbolised by the outgoing president , Mohammad Khatami , was over .
Neocon ideologues in and around the Bush administration concluded that only internal popular insurrection , encouraged from without , would topple Iran 's theocracy .
Twelve months on , there is little sign of that -despite a destabilising $ 75 m ( £ 41 m ) US propaganda offensive , Voice of America broadcasts in Farsi and deepening American contacts with Iranian exile and separatist groups .
Liberal reform is indeed in retreat .
Conservatives , spiritually and politically underpinned by the leading radical cleric Muhammad Taghi Misbah - Yazdi , control all the main levers of power , including the Majlis ( parliament ) .
The Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , appears to have overcome initial doubts about Mr Ahmadinejad 's qualifications ; he has strongly backed him in Iran 's nuclear dispute with the west . ""
The opposition is regrouping , but so far to no avail .
Many people think they are a spent force , "" said Shirzad Bozorgmehr , the editor of an independent newspaper Iran News .
But while -disappointingly for the White House -a people 's revolt against the mullahs is not in prospect , peaceful manifestations of discontent and open criticism of the government are commonplace .
Although there are strict , sometimes oppressive limits to how far people can go , Iranians have not surrendered their right to dissent or the rudiments of democracy .
Like the obligatory scarves worn by Tehrani women , boundaries are constantly being pushed back .
Speaking for many younger Iranians worried about the economy , high unemployment and low wages , Noureddin Pirmoazzen , MP for Ardebil , did not mince his words in the majlis this week .
"" The slogans , promises and policies of the current government for curbing numerous problems have only made conditions worse , "" he said .
"" Such policies have also resulted in capital flight , and there is no news about giving the people their share of oil revenues , "" he complained .
The last point was a reference to Mr Ahmadinejad 's unfulfilled campaign promise to parcel out windfall profits from energy sales to the most needy .
Paradoxically , the president is also under fierce establishment attack for expanding subsidies and giving handouts to impoverished provinces such as Khuzestan and Baluchistan .
A recent report produced by 50 prominent economists accused the president of recklessly deterring foreign investment , running a state - dominated , over - centralised economy , and causing a national brain drain . ""
The government is mismanaging the economy and wasting oil revenues .
It 's worse than under the Shah , "" said Mohammad Atrianfar , founder of Shargh , a leading pro - reform newspaper and political ally of Mr Ahmadinejad 's main rival , former president Hashemi Rafsanjani .
The cause of reform in Iran was still alive , he said .
"" It does not have a high profile right now .
It is a social movement beyond the political system ...
Maybe we need a decade to overcome these fundamentalist tendencies .
But we will .
"" The government faces other continuing challenges to its unity and authority .
Ethnic , religious and political unrest is bubbling along Iran 's borders , particularly in Kurdish and Azeri areas and in oil - rich Iranian Arab Khuzestan in the south - east .
It is accompanied by dark talk of foreign -meaning American and British -meddling and provocations .
The government was also accused of endorsing confrontational tactics this week after police broke up a women 's rights demonstration in Tehran , a subject of growing controversy among a population predominantly aged 30 or under .
"" We are currently at a very sensitive juncture where ethnic and gender demands are issues of concern , "" Nayyereh Akhaven , a female MP , sternly reminded Mr Ahmadinejad and his ministers .
This autumn 's elections for the Assembly of Experts , the body that appoints the Supreme Leader and oversees his performance , is also likely to prove contentious .
Intense jockeying for electoral position was already under way , with Mr Rafsanjani expected to stand , an informed source said .
That could foreshadow a bid for the top post now held by Mr Khamenei , Mr Ahmadinejad 's protector . ""
Rafsanjani would like the job [ of supreme leader ] .
But there would be huge resistance .
The two camps may block each other , "" the source said .
In the event of such a deadlock , the whole Khomeinist idea of having a senior religious figure at the helm of the Islamic republic might have to be reconsidered .
"" I do n't think that anyone in future will be allowed to have all that power , "" the source added .

2006-06-21,"Iran 's World cup sojourn has not been a happy one .
There have been arguments in the dressing room , injuries to key players , and the distractions and demonstrations arising from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's remarks about the Holocaust .
On the pitch , Iran suffered straight defeats by Mexico and Portugal and were consigned to an early , slightly ignominious exit from the competition .
All this has left Tehranis subdued if not depressed .
The normally frantic streets , packed pavement to pavement with traffic , emptied eeerily during the second , evening match against Portugal .
Hotel foyers where satellite TV was available were packed with well - to - do businessmen , fashionable women shoppers , anxious young men and bored children .
Every lame Iranian attack brought clenched - fist excitement , each silky Portuguese strike a silent , shrugging gloom .
When the final whistle blew , a pretty receptionist slumped sadly over her desk .
The passion was there all right .
It was just that it was held tight inside her , like so much of what Iranians feel and think .
Mullahdom does not totally encourage free expression .
Iranians are not especially demonstrative by nature .
Unlike younger nations , such as England or America , they rarely shout or lose their tempers in public .
They do n't throw things at each other or the opposition .
Until they get really mad , that is , as Saddam Hussein discovered during the eight - year Iran - Iraq war in the 1980s .
Then they do n't give up .
Either they win , which was n't an option in the World Cup but was in Iraq , or they go down with all hands .
George Bush please note .
As with other countries , politics is never far away when Iranians compete against other nations .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's adviser , Ali Akbar Javanfekr , issued a rallying cry on Monday to chastened compatriots - and a sinister warning about the dangers of politically incorrect despondency . ""
All teams participating in the World Cup are not supposed to win and become champions , "" he explained , in case anyone was in doubt .
He went on : "" The national football team have problems .
The press should highlight these problems through constructive criticism .
By creating a negative image , the Iranian nation will be even more disappointed .
The sports press should be cautious in this regard . ""
Imagine telling Sun or Guardian or Washington Post sports writers to pull their punches for the sake of national morale .
Then again , imagine tacitly threatening them with the sack or worse if they disobey .
It might work .
Not all is lost .
Iran 's midfielder Ferydoon Zandi told reporters that the best was yet to come , in Iran 's final match against Angola this afternoon .
"" We have n't shown what we can do at all , "" he said .
"" But now we can play without pressure , maybe that has been a factor .
We want to leave with a victory . ""
Once again , that old triumph of hope over experience .
A sinking feeling says Iran , unfairly ostracised , battered and beleaguered in so many other respects internationally , is on a hiding to nothing once again .
But at least they 'll take it on the chin .
Would that England were so wise ."
2006-06-26,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is the latest in a long line of American bogeymen :
Libya 's Colonel Gadafy , Panama 's Manuel Noriega , Serbia 's Slobodan Milosevic , Iraq 's Saddam Hussein and al - Qaida 's Osama bin Laden , to name a few .
But by casting Iran 's president in the prime target role of maverick evildoer , the Bush administration ignores the complex forces that brought him to power last year and his previously unsuspected political skills , both supporters and critics say .
As domestic opponents have already discovered , underestimating Mr Ahmadinejad is tempting - and foolish .
The president 's rising popularity owes as much to his common touch as US enmity .
Many ordinary Iranians , while complaining about wages , inflation and restricted personal freedoms , approve of the Blair - like "" national conversation "" that Mr Ahmadinejad has launched through fortnightly provincial tours and rallies .
"" He is a good man .
He tries to do his best , "" said Saeideh , a student in Shiraz .
"" My family supported [ Mohammad ] Khatami [ the former reformist president ] .
But it is good the way Ahmadinejad stands up to the Americans . ""
Mohammad Atrianfar , founder of the main opposition newspaper , Shargh , admitted that Mr Ahmadinejad had succeeded in cultivating a popular image , but questioned his authority .
"" My impression is that he is just a mouthpiece , an amplifier for various interests elsewhere , "" Mr Atrianfar said .
Anti - government intellectuals and secularists also attribute Mr Ahmadinejad 's ascendancy to the backing of clerical hardliners , as well as the Revolutionary Guards and basij militia .
They said the president owed his job to the supreme leader , Ali Khamenei , who was primarily concerned with establishing Iran 's leadership in the Muslim world over the rival claims of Arab states such as Egypt .
Mr Khamenei is said to be gratified by Mr Ahmadinejad 's hero status in the Arab world as a scourge of the Bush administration and champion of Palestinian rights .
At the same time , western diplomats said there was evidence the president was "" learning on the job "" .
He had toned down his rhetoric and qualified last autumn 's inflammatory remarks on the Holocaust and Israel , they said .
He now says Iran simply wants justice ( a key Ahmadinejad theme ) for Palestinians and does not see why Muslims should pay for past European persecution of Jews .
Yet Mr Ahmadinejad is far from being a puppet of Iran 's mullahs or clerics .
A strong current of anti - clericalism permeates the Islamic republic 27 years after the revolution , largely the product of perceived corruption and abuse of power .
His advancement came in part because , ironically , he was able to assume Mr Khatami 's mantle as the "" anti - status quo candidate "" , a source said .
The secret of Mr Ahmadinejad 's success was that he had distanced himself from both the Islamic establishment and the discredited , mostly middle - class reformers of the Khatami era , building a third constituency among the working classes , younger voters and the less well - off .
Siamak Namazi , an independent Tehran political analyst , said : "" Ahmadinejad represents the second generation of revolutionaries , the foot soldiers of 1979 .
They are the ones who fought the war against Iraq , they are the ones who suffered when Saddam used chemical weapons ( whose components were supplied by the west ) .
They are the ones who now get lectured by the west about WMD .
They feel very suspicious about the west .
They also feel the older generation sold them out . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad was "" politically right but economically ultra - left "" , he added .
Some see Mr Ahmadinejad as a product of the pre - revolutionary period in which Marxist ideas mingled with Sufi mysticism and Islamic spiritual values .
His support for a centrally directed economy , continued state subsidies and more equal rights for women can thus be reconciled with his opposition to reform of Iran 's inherently conservative , Islamic - based power structure .
All the same , economic mismanagement and inefficiency may yet be his undoing .
"" This is a sick economy dependent on the price of oil , "" said Vahid Karimi of the Institute for Political and International Studies .
Structural weaknesses including lack of investment , a tiny private sector , and capital flight were not being addressed , a report by 50 prominent economists concluded .
A fast - growing population was increasingly demanding more than the government was delivering , a western diplomat said .
"" They are squandering the oil windfall . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad 's fall , if and when it comes , is unlikely to be the result of political insurrection , outside intervention , or his demonisation as America 's new bogeyman .
Its likely cause will be more mundane .
In Iran , as elsewhere , it 's the economy , stupid ."

2006-06-27,"Maurice Motamed has one of the loneliest jobs in the Middle East .
When Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made his controversial Holocaust statements , the sole Jewish MP in Iran 's 290-member Majlis ( parliament ) felt he had no option but to confront him . ""
When our president spoke about the Holocaust , I considered it my duty as a Jew to speak about this issue , "" Mr Motamed said in his office in Tehran . ""
The biggest disaster in human history is based on tens of thousands of films and documents .
I said these remarks are a big insult to the whole Jewish society in Iran and the whole world . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad , president of an overwhelmingly Muslim state , has not apologised .
But Mr Motamed said the president had since qualified his statement by insisting that he had not denied the Holocaust and was not an anti - semite .

Since 1906 Iran 's constitution has guaranteed the Jewish community one seat in the Majlis .

Although he took on Mr Ahmadinejad about the Holocaust , Mr Motamed supports the president on other issues , including the standoff with the US , Europe and Israel over the country 's nuclear programme .
"" I am an Iranian first and a Jew second , "" he said .
He acknowledged there were problems with being a Jew in Iran , as there were for the country 's other minorities .
But he said that Iran was relatively tolerant .
"" There is no pressure on the synagogues , no problems of desecration .

Jews have been living in Iran in large numbers since Cyrus the Great freed them from slavery when he captured Babylon in 539BC .

He confirmed that Jews and other minorities were excluded from "" sensitive "" posts in the military and judiciary .
And the authorities refuse to allow Jewish schools to close on the sabbath .

2006-06-30,"What images come to our mind these days when we think of Iran ?
The Iranian president , Dr Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , wearing his usual smirk , looking like a naughty kid who has just got away with breaking the neighbours ' windows , clerics making furious speeches , women dressed in their mandatory veils , public meetings , protests , interviews with citizens forced to make the appropriate statements about the topic of the day - WMDs , for example .
Such images signify the distance between the private and public spaces , grown to such an extent that almost every public gesture implies a political declaration : women 's clothing , turbaned men in their clerical garbs , unmarried men and women consorting in public , all these become political statements rather than indications of private lifestyles .
It does not matter whether the statements are for or against the state ; what matters is that none can gain significance independent of the state .
Judging by such images , life in Iran is a series of urgent and extraordinary occurrences , shaped and controlled by political decision - makers .
Then there are images that gain a certain exotic charm and humour because they focus on the discrepancies , on the extreme tensions within Iranian society - young girls looking like Vogue models posing under a larger - than - life poster of an ayatollah ; a disco thriving under the stern gaze of a pulpit .
It is amazing how politics can confiscate reality : its variety , nuance , more than anything else , the extraordinariness of what goes by the title of ordinary life .
Which brings us to photographs : what makes them unsettling and even politically subversive is that neither the camera nor the subjects attempts to make a political statement ; oblivious of the monitoring eye of the state , the people in these photographs are caught in the business of everyday life , in the miracle of living .
The adults have achieved the attitude of the children ; like the small boy waiting by the phone booth for his mother , the young girl and boy playing in the park , the child standing on a swing , they are completely engrossed in the moment .
In that moment , the president , the morality police and the fate of WMDs do not exist .
These moments become important because they reaffirm life , reminding us that politics should be at the service of that life , to ensure the right of every individual to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness , regardless of race , religion , class , gender , creed .
In a strange way , the images restore the dignity that is taken away from a people when they become too much of a collective , when they are constantly formulated and summarised into categories and definitions .
Individuals - even when forced into uniformity through imposition of a repressive ideology - still manage to preserve their individuality , their uniqueness .
They are proof of the vulnerability of the totalitarian state : it can jail and torture its political opponents , but can it ever arrest and put in jail millions of people who want to dress the way they like , listen to their favourite music , raise their children as they see fit ?
Can it ever force them to look and act as it wishes ?
The women in the photographs are all veiled but not one looks like another ; the way they wear the veil , their movements and gestures , the amount of hair that is left out differentiates one from the other .
The cleric does not remind us of the political and religious pulpit ; he is simply waiting on the sidewalk , like any other citizen .
The young girl walking a dog is oblivious to the fact that the religious orthodoxy , considering dogs unclean , has put many stray dogs to sleep , denouncing dog walkers as western stooges ; she could be any young girl from any other part of the world , taking her pet out for a quiet walk .
The serious - looking family out on a picnic pose not for the scrutinising eye of a regime but for the camera .
We become interested in these images not because of their political significance but because we are curious about them as individuals : who is that young girl talking to on the mobile phone with such intensity ?
That young man and woman , forbidden to touch or show any sign of intimacy in public , why do they look so mysterious ?
For their interlocutors , the photographs are reminders of our shared humanity , the fact that no matter what the cultural differences , the Iranian people , like the rest of us , fall in and out of love , enjoy a beautiful view , care for their animals , are entertained by family outings , use mobiles , are traditional , or are not .
It is a sad world that forgets this shared humanity , in a sense denying life at its most basic and possibly most sacred .
Perhaps next time someone reminds us of the poet 's words , "" If you prick us , do we not bleed ? "" we will hesitate before we shrug and say , "" But they come from a different culture , they do n't bleed like us ! """

His analysis overlooks the contradictions in Iranian society and the widespread unpopularity of this regime .
He portrays Ahmadinejad as an "" anti - status - quo candidate "" who has built "" a third constituency among the working classes , younger voters and the less well - off "" .
A closer analysis shows the opposite .
The press , within Iran and outside , reported the courageous demonstration of women on June 12 in one of Tehran 's main squares , calling for measures to reduce institutional discrimination against women .
The demonstration was brutally attacked and over 70 activists arrested .
Since the beginning of June several student associations in universities across the country have been dissolved and their leaders arrested .
Since the 1980s the Committee for the Defence of Iranian People 's Rights ( Codir ) has promoted human rights for the Iranian people .
Ahmadinejad 's year in office has forced those concerned with justice in Iran to redouble their efforts .
Tisdall overlooks the fact that the president 's real base is not among the masses but with the Guards Corps ( Revolutionary Guard ) and intelligence services .
Ahmadinejad 's primary aim is a return to the so - called revolutionary zeal of the 1980s , which witnessed widespread unrestrained persecution of trade unionists , students and intellectuals .
Tisdall points to Ahmadinejad 's "" previously unsuspected political skills "" , but fails to mention that the president 's rise to power has been assisted by "" skills "" he acquired during the regime 's campaign of terror in Kurdistan and other minority - populated provinces in the 80s and 90s .
During these years the use of terror , through the Islamic militia and Guards Corps in particular , ensured compliance with the war effort and the dragooning of children into military service .
The Iran - Iraq war in 1980 - 88 devastated Iran .
The centralisation of power , justified by the clergy for the war effort , continued into peacetime , as did persecution of opponents of the Islamic Republic 's policies .
The significance of the presidential victory of Mohammad Khatami in 1997 was the promise of reform through the creation of a civil society in Iran reflecting the country 's social base and aspirations .
He offered hope to young people , students , women and intellectuals .
The Iranian people are not fundamentally opposed to Islam .
But an increasingly young and outward - looking population is today feeling constrained by the dead hand of the theocratic dictatorship .
The election of Ahmadinejad , in a flawed electoral process manipulated by the clergy and the Guards Corps , is the latest attempt to suppress the democratic spirit of the Iranian people .
And far from enjoying the popularity suggested in your news story ( A year on , Ahmadinejad 's popularity is soaring , June 21 ) , the regime is struggling to enforce its position through terror and manipulation .
As the international chatter of war against Iran increases , regime change becomes ever more pressing .
But it can not be achieved with US cruise missiles or external forces .
Most Iranians want change , but it will only be achieved by Iranians themselves together with international solidarity and understanding . ·

2006-07-14,"Israel 's latest actions prompted a fresh outburst from Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who has previously called for the country to be "" wiped off the map "" .
At a rally in the north - western Iranian province of Azerbaijan , Mr Ahmadinejad called on Israel 's western allies to condemn its "" atrocities "" in Lebanon or stand accused as participants .
"" You who claim to be defenders of human rights and who are ready to issue resolutions one after the other , why do you stay silent in the face of Israeli crimes ? "" he said .
"" The situation in Lebanon and Palestine is a test for international organisations who claim to be defenders of human rights .
Keeping silent wo n't solve any problems .
Those who support this savage Zionist action through their silence are participants and should be prosecuted . ""
In Syria 's capital , Damascus , official reaction was muted but the public mood was defiant .
Relations between Syria and Lebanon have been strained since the killing of the former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri in a bomb attack in Beirut last year and the subsequent withdrawal from Lebanon of Syrian troops .
Throughout the day , Syrian TV ran reports from Lebanon and Gaza , showing the damage to Beirut 's infrastructure .
Images of Syrians waving the yellow flag of Hizbullah were shown , accompanied by patriotic music and footage of Israeli soldiers carrying wounded colleagues .
Buying a newspaper in Damascus , Abdel Hadi , a minibus driver , said Syrians were ready to defend themselves against any attack .
"" We will defend our brothers in Lebanon if we have to , "" he said .
"" We are ready for this ... ""
Dr Marwan al - Kabalan , an analyst at Damascus University 's Centre for Strategic Studies , said Hizbullah was seen as leading the resistance against Israel .
"" The public as well as the government is sympathetic to the Lebanese and the Palestinians , "" he said .
He said there was concern about George Bush 's remarks on the situation .
Speaking in Germany yesterday , Mr Bush said Syria "" needs to be held to account "" for supporting Hizbullah . ""
For me , this is a green light for the Israelis , "" said Mr Kabalana
"" Olmert [ Israel 's prime minister ] is trying to demonstrate to the Israeli military establishment that he is tough and he will try to restore pride to Israel , even if the price is attacking Syria . ""
Other Arab leaders have been trying to mediate in the crisis .
On Wednesday Egypt 's foreign minister , Ahmed Ali Aboul Gheit , visited Damascus to discuss the situation .
But Saudi Arabia blamed "" elements "" inside Lebanon for the violence . ""
A distinction must be made between legitimate resistance and uncalculated adventures undertaken by elements inside [ Lebanon ] and those behind them without recourse to the legal authorities and consulting and coordinating with Arab nations , "" a statement on the official news agency , SPA , said .
"" These elements should bear the responsibility for their irresponsible actions ... """
2006-08-04,"Tony Blair and his rival for George Bush 's febrile attention span , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran , yesterday made statements to promote their competing views of the crisis in Lebanon and what we should all do next .
The former Tehran traffic gridlock expert again suggested the Middle East would be better off "" without the existence of the Zionist regime "" .
On the other hand , the former lead singer of Ugly Rumours used his monthly No 10 press conference in London to claim -repeatedly - that he is trying to promote peace and interfaith harmony throughout the Middle East .
For this he was subjected to sarcasm and worse for an hour .
In his own home too .
It was a surreal occasion .
Like many of his interrogators yesterday Mr Blair is about to go on his Summer Holiday . ""
No more worries for a week or two , "" as Sir Cliff Richard , a past host in August , once sang in a song of the same name .
Fat chance of that .
Mr Blair , no longer The Young One , sounded conciliatory , contrite even and looked well .
But then , he 's just been in California .
It could be a downhill August from here .
Half those present seemed to want the prime minister to cancel his break and concentrate on the search for a ceasefire .
The other half wanted him to leave it all to proper statesmen such as President Jacques Chirac .
"" I will be on the telephone , "" Mr Blair reassured the Sun , which had raised the holiday question with particular regard to John Prescott taking over .
For some reason Prezza 's annual promotion offends the Sun 's fragile sense of propriety .
No misplaced delicacy inhibited other questioners .
European correspondents piled in with the Blair - baiting .
At times it sounded like Blair ( plus Jerry Lewis of Israel Radio ) vs the Rest .
At one point a chap from Iranian TV complained about weapons shipments - ours , not theirs - and a well - spoken Iraqi woman journalist protested that British troops were not doing enough to prevent sectarian and criminal violence on the streets of Basra .
Mr Blair explained that it was dangerous out there , that some Iraqis wanted to see more squaddies on patrol , others wanted fewer .
A bit like his holiday really
: at this stage he ca n't help annoying everyone .
The messianic side of Mr Blair wants to solve the problem and restore the Middle East to a state of fraternal harmony not seen since Eve first spotted that apple .
The "" Yo Blair "" side of him just wants to play tennis and have a decent kip .
The Blair diplomatic line was that an immediate ceasefire was meaningless unless it applied effectively to both sides , ie Hizbullah too .
Though no one seemed to notice , he hinted as delicately as he could that everyone knows this deep down : that there is a gap between the public and private utterances of Arab leaders including Prime Minister Fouad Siniora of Lebanon whom he belatedly praised lavishly .
This accusation could not be levelled against his rival of the day , Mr Ahmadinejad .
Mr Blair kept saying his remarks were "" deeply unhelpful "" and even "" quite shocking "" .
But the pack was more interested in policy disputes within Whitehall and Westminster .
Contrite Blair admitted that not everyone agreed with him and that he does "" not disrespect their views "" - a double negative that undermined the gesture .
Towards the end an American reporter asked him about his talks in California about carbon trading systems , a sissy European idea which Mr Bush dislikes .
Had he done it to "" break ranks "" with Washington ?
Some days you just ca n't win .
Time for that holiday , fingers crossed for that UN resolution .
But do n't leave the mobile at home , Tony ."

2006-08-11,"Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is preparing to confront the US and United Nations security council over Iran 's nuclear activities partly to distract attention from the country 's worsening economic problems , sources in Tehran have said .
Iran 's hardline government said it would respond by August 22 to a western compromise package designed to defuse the dispute over its nuclear activities .
But diplomatic sources said that while expressing readiness to continue negotiations , Mr Ahmadinejad was opposing concessions on the issue , which has become key to maintaining his support following his disputed election victory one year ago .
"" People say it 's Ahmadinejad who 's the problem , "" a western diplomat said on Friday .
"" Even the Supreme Leader ( Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ) favours some kind of deal .
But this is Ahmadinejad 's flagship issue .
People like the way he has stood up to the Americans and he is n't going to throw that away . ""
Leila , a Tehran resident who , like other interviewees , asked not to be identified , said : "" If the US had not made such a big thing of the nuclear issue Ahmadinejad would have been in big trouble by now .
He could have been overthrown .
He 's achieved nothing in the past year .
The economy is very bad .
Everyone is poor . ""
Ali , a graduate in part - time employment , said it was very difficult for young people to find good jobs in a country where two - thirds of the 70 million population are under 30 . ""
Ahmadinejad promised to do all sorts of things .
But he has n't done anything .
He promised to share out the oil revenue .
Look at the price of oil now !
Where 's all that money going ?
There 's no economic management in this country .
It 's inefficient .
It 's corrupt , "" Ali said .
"" Ahmadinejad loves all the international attention .
He 's making the most of the nuclear issue to distract attention from the failures of the economy . ""
A recent Zogby International / Reader 's Digest poll , conducted by telephone from outside Iran , found strong public support for the government 's position that Iran has an "" inalienable right "" to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes .
Sixty - seven percent also agreed with Mr Ahmadinejad that the state of Israel should not exist , with only 9 % disagreeing .
But 41 % of respondents said making the economy more efficient was more important than nuclear capabilities or regional issues , with 27 % disagreeing .
The economy is coming under increasing public scrutiny despite official controls on newspapers and restricted access to the internet .
An estimated 80 % of all economic activity is under direct government control or managed through cooperatives known as bonyads , often dominated by well - connected clerics .
In contrast , 80 % of the population works in the private sector .
Critics say US sanctions , which have discouraged foreign investment and technology transfers , can not be wholly blamed for Iran 's economic backwardness .
There are also complaints that taxpayers ' money allegedly being sent to Hizbullah in Lebanon would be better spent at home .
Particular concern is focusing on oil - rich Iran 's lack of refining capacity .
It has a petrol shortfall of 30 m litres a day , which is made up by expensive imports .
Critics also note its failure to keep up with IT and e - commerce developments .
A recent UN report ranked Iran 98th in the world in e - government .
The finance minister , Davood Danesh - Jafari , promised this week that privatisations ordered by Ayatollah Khamenei in 2004 would be speeded up .
"" We need to change the status quo , "" he said .
One plan is to offer discounted shares in the bigger state companies to the 8 million most needy Iranians , in line with Mr Ahmadinejad 's redistributive "" Islamic socialism "" .
But the idea has hit trouble because few poor people have cash to spare to buy even discounted shares and the companies are usually making a loss . ""
Since the privatisation process ... failed to produce the desired results , one question that arises is how the present administration intends to move forward in containing the role of the state , "" said a daring commentary published by Iran Daily . ""

2006-08-14,""" Oh Almighty God , please , we beg you to send us our Guardian . ""
Yes , I know we have some enthusiastic readers
but I never realised the president of Iran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , was one of them .
Reading beyond the first line of the president 's new blog , though , it seems that he is not talking about the delivery of his daily newspaper but the long - awaited arrival of the Messiah - like figure known as the Hidden Imam .
In his first - and so far only - blog posting , Ahmadinejad goes on to describe his early life .
He 's certainly to be commended for that .
Most politicians would rather sign a million - dollar deal with Harper Collins for their autobiography than provide it free of charge on the internet .
On the other hand , publishers might not find Ahmadinejad 's life story sufficiently exciting to pay such a big advance .
After my birth - the fourth one in the family , "" Ahmadinejad writes , "" my family was under more pressures .
My father had finished six grade of elementary school .
He was a hard - bitten toiler blacksmith , a pious man who regularly participated in different religious programs .
Even though never the dazzling look of the world was appealing to him , but the pressure of the life caused that he decided to migrate to Tehran when I was one year old .
We chose to live in south central part of Tehran where is called Pamenar .
We are promised more gems in future postings : I will continue this topic later on as it took long in the beginning .
From now onwards , I will try to make it shorter and simpler .
With hope in God , I intend to wholeheartedly complete my talk in future with allotted fifteen minutes .
The blog itself is in four languages , represented by little flags : Iranian for Farsi , a Saudi flag for Arabic , a French flag , and one for English which looks to be split between the American flag and the cross of St George .
Clicking little boxes on the left - hand side gives a choice of five colour schemes for the blog - white , pink , two shades of green , and blue .
Readers are allowed to post comments but not , apparently , to read comments posted by others .
There 's also a section where you can vote on the question : "" Do you think that the US and Israeli intention and goal by attacking Lebanon is pulling the trigger for another world war ? ""
A picture of the president shows him writing with a pen on a sheet of paper , which is not very bloggerish .
Surely they could have sat him at a computer somewhere for the photograph .
All this underlines the fact that Ahmadinejad does n't really get the point of blogging .
A presidential blog is almost a contradiction in terms : blogs represent the voice of ordinary people , not politicians who are pretending to be ordinary people .
And of course ordinary people who blog in Iran and other parts of the Middle East risk ending up in jail ."
2006-08-14,"His political approach has become a byword for populism and yesterday President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad endowed it with a hi - tech dimension by launching his own weblog .
The hardline Iranian leader 's debut on the international blogosphere came in the form of a 2,300-word tract that asked readers to decide if the US and Israel were trying to start a new world war .
Mr Ahmadinejad , who has identified himself with Iran 's army of poor people , also described his humble origins in an impoverished rural village .
His entry into the mass ranks of bloggers marks the latest step in a concerted effort to communicate directly with ordinary Iranians over the heads of the elites .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's first year in office has been distinguished by a series of old - fashioned mass rallies throughout Iran aimed at wooing mass public support .
His resort to more up - to - date means appears on the presidential website at ahmadinejad.ir .
His first missive is available in English , French and Arabic - as well as Farsi - suggesting he is also aiming at an international audience .
It includes one of Mr Ahmadinejad 's bluntest statements yet on the conflict between Israel and the Iranian - backed militant group , Hizbullah , in Lebanon . ""
Do you think that the US and Israeli intention and goal by attacking Lebanon is pulling the trigger for another world war ? ""
He invites readers to vote yes or no .
In an autobiographical passage , the president attempts to explain the personal circumstances behind his radical Islamist political beliefs , including his fervent desire for Iran to pursue nuclear technology in defiance of western opposition . ""
During the era that nobility was a prestige and living in a city was perfection , I was born in a poor family in a remote village , "" he writes , labelling himself the son of "" a hard - bitten toiler blacksmith "" .
He ascribes his rapid rise to academic excellence which enabled him to finish 132nd out of 400,000 in university entrance exams .
He also describes reading newspapers with the help of adults while in first grade at school , from which he learned how Americans in Iran had been granted immunity from the country 's laws by the shah .
"" I realised that Mohammad Reza [ had ] attempted to add another page to the vicious case history , which was the humiliation and indignity of the Iranian people versus Americans . """
2006-08-17,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has started his own blog Photograph : Jewell Sammad / AFP / Getty Fancy averting the third world war ?
Ever wanted to cast a vote in the Islamic Republic of Iran but feared how your degenerate western opinions might go down ?
Well the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who started his own rather tedious blog this week , is giving you a unique chance to do exactly that .
In an online vote , the hardline Islamic president is asking in badly translated English : do you think that the US and Israeli intention and goal by attacking Lebanon is pulling the trigger for another world war ?
So far the vote is not going the way some of his more zealous revolutionaries would wish .
Some 139,986 people or 55 % are currently saying no , while 45 % or 113,047 say Israel and the US have pulled the trigger .
This result could mean that Iranians with internet access are mainly moderates horrified at their own president 's views ( for the full anti - Zionist tirade see his official site ) , or the vote has proved hugely popular with bloggers in the United States and Israel determined to scupper any propaganda value he might gain in having thousands agree with his bigotry .
Slate has thankfully done a round - up of some of the better blog comments about the president 's musings on his humble origins and on the rightness of the Islamic revolution .
The best one comes from reformist Ali Eteraz , who writes : "" What is most fascinating about it is how , over and over , he appeals to his poor background , and links it to the poverty endemic in Iran . ""
Obviously , the attempt is to paint the west as responsible for that poverty .
It is the same trick that the Muslim Marxists of the past employed to sow loyalty and allegiance among the Muslim masses during their hey - day in the 60s and 70s . ""
That , to me , is further proof of the theory that today 's political Islam is yesterday 's Marxism in different clothing . ""
So far , the only comment allowed to be posted on the president 's blog itself ( well on the English translation , which you can find by clicking the flag top right ) is from a US reader called Hani .
Any thoughts on a third world war Hani or the Iranian nuclear programme ?
No - he simply asks if the president can make the font bigger ."
2006-08-17,"The war in Lebanon began with bragging and ended with bragging .
Israel 's prime minister , Ehud Olmert , started the big talk and has lived to rue it .
Now it 's the turn of Hizbullah 's Hassan Nasrallah , Syria 's president , Bashar Assad , and Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The danger is that the current braggers might actually believe what they are saying and start another war .
Olmert gave his promises on July 12 , within hours of Hizbullah firing rockets at Israeli army posts and communities in the north and using this diversion to breach the border fence to kill and kidnap two soldiers .
He said that Israel would rescue the soldiers and destroy Hizbullah .
His lieutenants echoed him .
They created expectations which have not been fulfilled .
Hizbullah still exists .
The soldiers remain abducted .
Hizbullah was able to fire up to 250 rockets a day until the ceasefire on Monday morning .
In these senses , Israel did not win the war .
It also forfeited much international sympathy in responding to aggression because of the damage it inflicted on Lebanon and the killing of civilians , although the deaths , it must be said , in no way approximated to many wild claims , such as the assertion by a Palestinian organisation that , "" the force being used by the Israeli troops ... is aiming at exterminating as many people as possible . ""
Most Israelis backed the war as just and necessary .
People in northern towns said they had endured rockets from Lebanon for 30 years , first fired by Palestinians , who were cleared out , and then by Hizbullah .
Angry voices are now being heard - not so much about the reason for the war but because of the way it was handled .
Stories have been doing the rounds for weeks about the army 's lack of preparedness : of soldiers pulled out of everyday civilian life being sent into battle without proper training or orders ; of soldiers sent in to fight without enough food or water .
Everyone has a story - such as the soldier who did not have boots and went to war in running shoes , or the soldier who was given a gun and , when he protested he had never used that weapon before , was told to learn how to do so quickly .
This is a democratic society and the media are often aggressive and vocal : they are speaking of failures of strategy and leadership , in both the political and military spheres .
Among the questions being asked are : Should so much reliance have been placed on air strikes ?
Should ground forces have been sent in massively and much earlier ?
A commission of inquiry is likely .
Heads might roll .
Even during the war the northern command 's general was sidelined .
The chief of staff - an air force man , which was perhaps significant considering the strategy adopted - might not survive .
A commentator has noted that the generals are lucky that Winston Churchill is not prime minister : if he was he would have fired a clump of unsuccessful generals , as he did in North Africa before appointing Montgomery .
Olmert is being challenged .
A writer in the leading newspaper , Ha'aretz , has said he must go .
The call was carried at the top of page one and is being repeated elsewhere .
His defence will be , and it is valid , that Israel will have achieved much of what it wanted if the Lebanese army takes over the south and UNIFIL - the United Nations corps of peacekeepers - succeeds in policing the borde ; Hizbullah will have been pushed back , hopefully it is weakened , and Israelis can sleep securely .
And the Lebanese government might even be able to take control over its own country and rein in Hizbullah .
There is also anger from the civilian population in the north : a million people sat in bomb shelters for a month , or came south to stay with family and friends .
There is resentment that the government was not prepared for an emergency on such a scale and private organizations had to step in to provide food and health facilities .
Because of the openness of Israeli society , we know the exact number of soldiers and civilians who died , the number of homes , schools and hospitals damaged , and the $ 1 billion - plus economic cost .
This is not the first time that Israelis have suffered a reverse .
In the 1948 war , which followed the declaration of independence , army casualties were some 6,000 from the then population of 600,000 .
The Yom Kippur War of 1973 , when Egypt attacked , caught the country unprepared and the loss of life was heavy .
Bitter recriminations followed , and are heard to this day .
The entry into Lebanon in 1982 remains cause for furious argument , and even more the retreat in 2000 .
And so too last August 's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip , which the right wing assails as a defeat for Israel .
However , it would be folly for anyone to believe that as a result of the latest Lebanon war , Israel is a sitting duck for attack and destruction .
Israelis are bruised , but - while relieved that the danger to soldiers and civilians is over - many probably regret that the job of getting rid of Hizbullah was n't completed , that the organization will attack again sooner or later and war is unavoidable .
The army is as formidable as ever and has overwhelming national consensus behind it .
What is known about Hizbullah ?
To what extent has it been diminished ?
It admits to the death of less than 60 of its fighters ; Israel claims to have killed at least 500 .
To what extent has its command structure been undermined , and its network of underground bunkers and rocket launchers been taken out ?
In practice , how far might non - Shia Lebanese go to support it ?
The world is ignorant about these details .
Perhaps some of the journalists who flocked to Lebanon tried to find out , but failed .
Either way , they have n't told us .
Hassan Nasrallah , meanwhile , is bragging .
He has reason for it .
He is alive and so is his organization , whether severely damaged or not .
He is promising massive aid to the Lebanese people for reconstruction of houses and services which presumably means he is assured of funding from Iran 's oil income ; previously he was reportedly getting some $ 100 million a year , plus thousands of rockets for his arsenal .
He is also repeating his hatred for Israel and denial of its right to exist .
That is worrying : if he believes his own hubris it could lead him at some stage to repeat his July 12 adventure with tragic consequences for both Israelis and Lebanese .
He is being abetted by Syria 's President Bashar Assad , who has congratulated Hizbullah for its success in "" defeating Israel "" .
Assad brags about taking on Israel .
What he wants is the return of the Golan Heights seized by Israel in 1967 after Syrian attack .
Ironically , the chances of this happening are infinitely less with Assad uttering bellicose threats - however unrelated to reality they are , given reports about the wretched state of his army .
Israel might only do a deal if persuaded that it need not fear aggression from its neighbour ( anyone who has been on the Golan Heights and looked down on Israel 's vulnerable northern plain will understand this ) .
Iran 's Ahmadinejad continues to sound his theme of wanting Israel wiped out .
It seems he believes it , even if stirring the pot in Lebanon is useful in trying to divert world anxiety about his country 's nuclear ambitions .
Meanwhile , as the ceasefire takes effect - and hopefully holds - the crisis in the Gaza Strip will again come to the fore .
Hamas , like Hizbullah , does not accept Israel 's existence .
The Israeli soldier abducted in June is still not free .
Qassam rockets are still hitting Israeli towns ; Israel is firing back , killing people and adding to the misery of Gazan existence .
But the hi - tech army is as little able to halt the missiles here as it was in the north .
So where to now ?
The fundamental problems remain exactly what they were five weeks ago : refusal by rejectionist Arab states and organisations to accept Israel , continuing Israeli occupation of the West Bank , and failure to create an independent and viable Palestinian state .
There can not be peace in the region until these are resolved .
Killing , whoever does it to whom , is only a short - term answer ."
2006-08-21,"Tensions between Iran and the west have rarely been greater than they are today .
On the one side , President George Bush has accused Iran of being behind the attack by Hizbullah on Israel that sparked the Lebanon war ; and both the US and Britain say that Iran is bent on developing nuclear weapons .
On the other , Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has claimed that the Bush administration is trampling on the rights of Muslims throughout the world ; the US is the "" Global Arrogance "" ( the term which has replaced the "" Great Satan "" in the Iranian lexicon ) in which Washington 's plan for a "" new Middle East "" is simply a scheme to subjugate the region to US and commercial interests .
Just last week , an article by Seymour Hersh , the respected US investigative reporter , which claimed that the war against Iran 's proxy Hizbullah was a premeditated US - directed warm - up for an attack on Iran itself , stoked fears in Tehran that a US air assault on its nuclear facilities , even regime change , are moving to the top of the agenda .
Officials in Tehran worry that , after Afghanistan and Iraq , Iran is seen by Bush as "" unfinished business "" - and that , urged on by Israel , he is determined to destroy what both countries see as the looming threat of an "" Islamic bomb "" .
They hear Bush 's talk of "" Islamic fascists "" - and wonder whether he will soon be gunning for them .
There is a way out .
Tomorrow the Iranian government will present its long - awaited response to the west 's last - ditch compromise offer on nuclear power .
This package , belatedly backed by the US , offers Iran a range of incentives from implicit security , territorial guarantees and an end to sanctions , to new commercial and technological collaborations .
But first , Bush insists , Iran must suspend all uranium enrichment operations , which Washington believes are connected to its attempts to acquire bomb - making capability .
So far , Iran has insisted that it will not accept any such pre - conditions .
Officials say they are willing to resume negotiations with the west - but on equal terms .
So when Ahmadinejad delivers Iran 's formal reply at a Tehran press conference , the stage will be set for an epic clash that could reverberate across the Middle East and far beyond .
So far , the story has mostly been reported from the outside , and from a western perspective .
But what are the prospects for war and peace as seen from inside Iran ?
For the past two weeks the Guardian has been given unprecedented access to explore what ordinary Iranians think about the most pressing issue facing their country - and what some of the country 's most powerful men believe will happen next . '
Diplomatic chess '
In a high - ceilinged , thick - carpeted inner sanctum of Iran 's fortress - like Supreme National Security Council building in central Tehran , Ali Larijani patiently spells out the factors that will play a part in Iran 's decision .
The CIA would dearly love to penetrate inside these walls .
Perhaps it already has ; visitors ' mobile phones and other electronic devices are confiscated .
Larijani is an important man in Iran .
As secretary of the security council and chief nuclear negotiator , it is he , and his predecessor , Hassan Rowhani , who have by turns tantalised , teased and infuriated the west during three years of discussions on the nuclear dossier .
Iran plays a long and astute negotiating game , which Larijani likens to "" diplomatic chess "" .
Officials say they learned at the feet of masters : the European powers who exploited Persia during the 19th century "" Great Game "" .
Britain is still referred to as the "" Old Fox "" .
Larijani has a daunting reputation as the dour former head of state television whose programme schedules were both morally edifying and utterly tedious .
His appointment by Ahmadinejad was seen in the west as representing an ominous shift towards recalcitrance .
But in person he is charming and courteous .
"" There are many reasons why Iran is seeking nuclear power , "" he says .
"" The history of our nuclear activity dates back 45 years to the time of the ex - shah 's regime .
But after the Islamic revolution , some western countries condemned Iran and cancelled their nuclear agreements with us .
For example , the Americans had concluded an agreement for a research reactor in Tehran and also to provide the fuel .
But they cancelled the agreement and did not give back the money .
The Germans did the same .
So the lesson was : we have to be self - sufficient , to provide fuel for ourselves . ""
He continues : "" We do n't see why we should stop the scientific research of our country .
We understand why this is very sensitive .
But they ( the west ) are categorising countries .
Some countries can have access to high nuclear technology .
The others are told they can produce fruit juice and pears !
They say : ' Do n't seek a nuclear bomb . '
We do n't have any objection to that .
But unfortunately officials of some countries such as the UK say , ' We do n't want you to have the knowledge for nuclear technology ' .
This is not logical .
And we do n't pay attention to this . ""
The Americans ' contradictory impulses are to blame for the standoff , he says .
"" After September 11 2001 , they faced a problem in Afghanistan .
They requested assistance from Iran and we gave it .
But after the problem ended in Afghanistan , they called us the ' axis of evil ' .
This paradox has always been their way .
They want to kiss one side of our face , but at the same time they also want to slap the other side .
"" Iran is still willing to negotiate , Larijani concludes , but it will not give up its nuclear power programme .
Nor will it yield to preconditions such as Bush 's demand for an immediate suspension of uranium enrichment .
"" If they are going to seek an imposed agreement by putting pressure on us , we will not accept it .
If the atmosphere is not proper , we may delay our reply .
If you try to cultivate a flower in salty land , it does not grow . ""
For Larijani , the bottom line is respect .
And the evident lack of it in Washington , magnified by loose talk of enforced regime change , is one of many reasons why Iran is going nuclear .
A changing society Tehran is a city of elegant parks .
And none is more serene than Saee Park , off Vali Asr Avenue , one of the capital 's main thoroughfares .
Known as the "" lovers ' park "" , it is where young and not - so - young couples sit at dusk beneath a canopy of fragrant chinar , cypress and pine trees , exchanging gossip and intimacies , sharing ice creams and swapping phone numbers .
According to Reza , 27 , and his girlfriend , things are more easy - going socially than they were 10 years ago .
They attribute the change to the presidency of Mohammad Khatami , Ahmadinejad 's reformist predecessor .
Despite Ahmadinejad 's conservative instincts , the new government has been unable to put the street culture genie back in the bottle , Reza says .
"" There 's more personal freedom .
You do n't get harassed like you used to .
The young people are changing the older people 's attitude .
They have to accept it - they have no choice , so they go with the flow . ""
And in a country of 70 m , where two - thirds of the population is under 30 , the trend appears irreversible .
The present hardline government is not popular among many inhabitants of Saee Park .
They complain about its failure to expand and diversify an economy that is roughly 80 % state - controlled .
Younger people worry about careers and jobs , about the difficulties of foreign travel and internet censorship , about the lack of things to do and places to meet .
Leila , 27 , says she would like to go to parties , to clubs ; she would like to sing . ""
But they wo n't allow female singers , did you know that ?
Female vocalists are banned .
They say they are too alluring to men .
Poor men !
They have weak brains ! ""
Yussuf , 63 , has a different perspective .
"" I was a metallurgist until I retired .
I trained in the US during the Shah 's time .
I worked all my life .
But now I have to take part - time jobs because my pension is n't enough .
This government is no good , they 're all no good . ""
Yussuf has another complaint : the government is sending money to Hizbullah in Lebanon that would be better spent at home , he says .
"" First you must look after your own people . ""
His friend , Ali , agrees .
He wants to know into whose pockets Iran 's record oil revenue is going .
"" Some of them [ the governing elite ] are buying cars for $ 100,000 .
Think of that !
Did they get that money by working ? ""
All the same , Ahmadinejad 's personal brand of nationalist populism , typified by his defiant handling of the nuclear issue , has many admirers in Saee Park and beyond .
"" Why do n't they just leave us alone and let us live under our own rules ? "" asks a 32-year - old engineer . ""
Iran has the right to nuclear power , "" chanted a crowd in Ardabil , in northern Iran , last week .
During a series of nine rallies addressed by Ahmadinejad , the sentiments expressed by ordinary people are the same .
Western attempts to deny Iran nuclear technology are "" an obvious attempt to keep us down , like they want to keep all the developing countries down , "" says Majid , a 30-year - old teacher in Tehran .
"" We do n't want nuclear weapons .
But we want to build our country .
What 's wrong with that ?
"" Iranians may be cut off from the modern western world in many ways , but they are well versed in the long history of western intervention in Persia .
From the Treaty of Golestan in 1813 , by which Russia took control of Iran 's Caucasus territories , to the 1953 CIA - led coup that toppled Iran 's democratically elected prime minister , Mohammad Mosaddeq , from the US embassy hostage siege to the Iran - Contra scandal , a tale of national subjugation and degradation forms the context in which Iran looks at the west .
And Iranians hear , in derogatory western talk of "" mad mullahs "" , an echo of a 19th - century British diplomat 's sneering reference to "" incomprehensible orientals "" .
It smacks of disrespect .
And now , with Washington 's neo - conservatives on one side and Ahmadinejad 's neo - conservatives on the other , this mutual antagonism and misunderstanding is coming to a head .
In some analyses , it has brought the two countries to the brink of military conflict .
If the US attacks , experts say it is likely to take the form of "" precision strikes "" on the four main nuclear facilities and possibly Iranian armed forces and Revolutionary Guard bases , too .
But Pentagon planners know Iran has the potential to retaliate , as the unexpected success of Hizbullah in Lebanon has shown .
This week the US ambassador to Iraq highlighted what he said were Iranian attempts to push Shia militants into attacks on coalition forces in Iraq .
And Baghdad is only one possible theatre for Iranian reprisals should the US pull the trigger .
Mohammad Saeidi is a practical man .
Sidestepping the political , ideological and historical aspects of the nuclear dispute with the west , the vice - president of Iran 's Atomic Energy Organisation is focused on a set of problems that must be solved logically if the country and its people are to develop to their full potential . ""
The country 's oil and gas reserves will last a maximum of another 25 or 30 years , "" he says .
"" Therefore we have to provide other resources . ""
About 7,000 people work in Iran 's atomic establishment - principally in Tehran and at the Bushehr , Arak , Isfahan and Natanz complexes .
Saeidi says there are plans to build 20 nuclear power stations in all , at a cost of $ 24-$25bn .
The first , at Bushehr , built with Russian help , is expected to come on stream next year .
Saeidi says that in going nuclear Iran is only following the example of other countries with growing populations and rising energy demand .
Nuclear power is cheaper , and its raw component , naturally occurring uranium , is in plentiful supply in Iran 's central deserts .
It is the cascade of 164 centrifuges constructed at Natanz that has drawn most international attention since Ahmadinejad announced last April that Iran had mastered the processes for uranium enrichment .
It was Natanz that finally prompted the US to join with European negotiators in offering the compromise incentives package that is now on the table .
But like Larijani , Saeidi stresses the research stage nature of this work - and the ongoing inspections of Natanz and other plants by the International Atomic Energy Agency .
To try to divert nuclear material for bomb - making purposes without the UN knowing would be "" impossible "" , he says , and if a deal is struck , Tehran would be ready to reintroduce spot checks .
But , in any case , bomb - making is not Iran 's aim , Saeidi says - even if it had the capacity , which it does not .
Overall , independent experts tend to agree that , at present , Iran does not have the wherewithal to build a nuclear weapon .
But that does not mean it will not in future .
Saeidi denies that Iran kept its facilities at Natanz secret , as claimed in 2003 by the Bush administration .
He says there was no legal necessity to notify the IAEA before nuclear material had entered the plant .
"" Natanz is a very large factory .
You can not hide it .
It was n't secret . ""
He also denies receiving help from Pakistan , now or in the past , despite a spate of disclosures concerning the proliferation network run by the Pakistani scientist , AQ Khan .
"" We do n't have any relation to Pakistan on the nuclear issue .
All the equipment and components we are using are made by Iranian companies and factories . ""
Needless to say , such statements are disputed by the US and other western governments who suspect that Iran may be running a hidden , parallel uranium enrichment programme using more advanced centrifuges .
They worry it is also experimenting with plutonium reprocessing .
But all such claims are met with a flat denial .
"" We do n't have any secret programme .
We do n't have any secrets , "" Saeidi says .
Iran does not want the bomb , he and other officials insist ; and it has no plans to build one .
What it does want is a plentiful future supply of nuclear energy to fuel the rise of a new , more powerful nation - and in this ambition , it will brook no obstacles .
Ahmadinejad 's vision
The man who could make all the difference is Ahmadinejad himself .
He insists that Iran 's intentions were not to make a bomb - "" Iranians have mastered the complete cycle of uranium enrichment by themselves .
But we will use it for peaceful purposes , for nuclear power .
This is our right and no one can take this right away from us . ""
But the man best known in the west for his desire to "" wipe Israel off the map "" and his questioning of the Holocaust , this blacksmith 's son who rose to be mayor of Tehran before unexpectedly winning the presidency a year ago this month , is a controversial figure inside Iran , too .
Many people , largely among the working class and in rural areas , adore him .
Others , particularly among the intellectual elite of Tehran , fear his devout Islamic beliefs and his conservative political instincts will further isolate the country .
For Iran 's president is a true believer .
He maintains that the 1979 revolution that overthrew the shah was besmirched and betrayed after the death of its leader , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , by pragmatists and corrupt mercantilists , by pro - western compromisers and reformists .
Ahmadinejad 's famously humble lifestyle , emphasised by his rumpled jackets and unkempt beard , offers but one clue to the fundamentalist spirit that moves him .
Tehranis say his vision is a return to the ideals of 1979 , including a reinvigorated social conservatism , a revived popular piety , and a principled rejection of the Christian and Zionist "" crusader "" west .
Many political moderates , western diplomats and ordinary citizens say Ahmadinejad 's vision is to turn the clock back to a more honest and more dutiful time .
And what better way to demonstrate the uplifting virtues and potency of this religious retrenchment than defiance of the west over the nuclear issue ?
Here is a golden opportunity to re - affirm Iran 's compromised independence and dignity - and restore both the international respect and the religious values that Ahjmadinejad believes the revolution has squandered since 1989 .
This is Ahmadinejad 's chance .
It may be naive to believe that Iran 's government , surrounded by nuclear - armed neighbours and directly threatened by the US , is not seeking to acquire a nuclear weapons capability .
"" The Americans have been seeking regime change in Iran ever since the victory of the revolution , "" say Larijani .
Given such widespread convictions , and the example of several other countries that have built atomic weapons without facing serious penalties , Iran 's leaders might be thought remiss in not seeking to arm themselves .
But more naive , perhaps , and potentially even more destabilising , is Ahmadinejad 's apparent belief that by confronting the west over the nuclear issue , he can revive the purist , Khomeini - era ideal of fundamentalist Islamic revolution in a country that is changing rapidly .
Most Iranians support the government 's pursuit of nuclear power .
But most oppose the intolerant theocracy that is Khomeini 's legacy .
In his brilliant new book , Confronting Iran , Ali Ansari portrays the growing "" secularisation "" of Iranian society as an unstoppable force . ""
Fewer and fewer people show an interest in organised religion , "" he writes .
And in Tehran the evidence of that is everywhere .
Iran is a rich country , poorly run .
Slowly but surely its people are demanding and obtaining change .
Iran does seem destined once again to be a great regional power , but that destiny is likely to be attained despite its religious leadership - and despite the Bush administration 's counter - productive bullying .
Ahmadinejad , the articulate champion of Iran 's national rights , is a potent figure .
But Ahmadinejad , the would - be visionary leader of a resurgent revolution awaiting the coming of the Hidden Imam , is living a dangerous illusion .
And it is Iranians , not the US air force , who should be allowed to shatter his dream ."

2006-08-27,"Iran test - fired a long - range missile from a submarine in the Gulf yesterday as part of an orchestrated show of defiance ahead of the United Nations security council 's Thursday deadline to suspend part of its nuclear programme .
Iranian state television carried a video clip showing the missile being launched and hitting a target .
The show of military strength came less than 24 hours after the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , formally opened a heavy water plant that could be used in the production of nuclear weapons .
The missile launch underlines Iran 's ability to create havoc in the Gulf by closing off the Straits of Hormuz to oil tankers , a move that would create serious shortages and send prices soaring .
An Iranian navy commander , Sajjad Kouchaki , quoted on the broadcast , described the missile as Iranian - built , "" with a very high speed and destructive power .
It is also radar - evading . ""
The UN has given Iran until Thursday to suspend its uranium enrichment programme , which Tehran claims is for purely civilian purposes but which the US and others in the west view as a step towards achieving a nuclear weapons capability .
If Iran fails to comply , the US favours imposing sanctions but Russia and China , which both have a veto on the security council , have shown little enthusiasm for such a move .
Tehran disclosed yesterday that the UN secretary general , Kofi Annan , is to go to Iran on Saturday for a two - day visit to see if there is a way out of the crisis .
Iran on Tuesday set out its counter - proposals to the security council in a 23-page memorandum but there has been no official response yet from the US or Europe .
The crisis seems likely to escalate as Iran is refusing to suspend uranium enrichment as a precondition for talks .
Ali Larijani , Iran 's chief nuclear negotiator , said yesterday that any punitive measures by the west would not deflect Iran from its pursuit of nuclear power .
"" Production of nuclear fuel is our strategic aim , "" he told state radio . ""
Any measure to deprive Iran of its right will not change our mind about our aim . ""
Mohammad Reza Baqheri , the deputy foreign minister , adopted a harder line on the issue , saying that Iran would never halt uranium enrichment .
"" It is our red line .
We will never do it , "" he told the official IRNA news agency ."
2006-08-30,"President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran brushed off a looming UN deadline to suspend a key part of his country 's nuclear programme by dismissing the international body as an illegitimate tool of Britain and America .
In a press conference in Tehran yesterday , Mr Ahmadinejad restated his determination to continue Iran 's nuclear activities , which the west suspects is aimed at producing an atomic bomb . ""
The use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is the right of the Iranian nation .
The Iranian nation has chosen this path ...
no one can prevent it , "" he said .
His comments came two days before tomorrow 's deadline , set by the UN security council , for Iran to suspend uranium enrichment , a process that can be used to build nuclear weapons , or face possible economic sanctions .
Iran 's response , presented last week , to an incentive package aimed at settling the dispute pointedly omitted any offer to suspend enrichment , which the UN has set as a precondition .
Mr Ahmadinejad also dismissed the possibility of suspension in response to a planned visit to Tehran by the UN secretary - general , Kofi Annan , this weekend .
"" We believe Mr Annan has to conduct himself in the context of international laws and regulations , "" he said .
"" No one should be accorded special powers . ""
The Iranian leader 's defiant comments came amid familiar anti - western rhetoric directed specifically at Britain and America , whom he accused of treating other countries like "" slaves "" and of being the main cause of international tensions .
In an eye - catching gesture , he also challenged President George Bush to a live uncensored televised debate on how the world was run .
The White House dismissed the proposal as a "" diversion "" .
Mr Ahmadinejad accused Britain and America of running a discredited international order stemming from their status as victors in the second world war , and identified the veto power they enjoy as permanent members of the security council as a cause of global injustice . ""
Today certain countries have put aside special concessions for themselves and in the UN they have special rights , "" he said .
"" In the security council , which is supposed to achieve peace and security in the world , Britain and the United States have special rights and concessions .
If another nation is involved in a conflict with them or is oppressed by them , there is no recourse for it .
International relations has reached a point where the Americans and the British are imposing their will on more than 180 nations around the world . ""

2006-09-01,"President George Bush demanded that there be "" consequences "" for Iran after it ignored a UN security council deadline yesterday to suspend part of its nuclear programme .
Washington wants UN sanctions imposed on Tehran as quickly as possible , but the security council is seriously divided .
In a defiant speech to cheering crowds during a regional tour , the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , said the country would not be bullied .
The Iranian government has hinted at retaliatory action if sanctions are imposed .
The way to sanctions was opened yesterday when the security council received a negative report from Mohamed El Baradei , the head of the UN nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency .
It confirmed that , as of Tuesday , the last day that its inspectors were able to carry out observations : "" Iran has not suspended its enrichment activities . ""
It also said that three years of IAEA investigations still had not been able to confirm "" the peaceful nature of Iran 's nuclear programme because of lack of cooperation from Tehran "" .
The security council is due to meet next week to begin discussion on a new resolution to impose sanctions , but the negotiations could take months .
Russia and China , which have close economic ties with Iran and are veto - wielding permanent members of the security council , are lukewarm about punitive measures .
Britain and France , also permanent members , have positioned themselves between the US and Russia and China : prepared to back sanctions while leaving open the prospect of further negotiations with Tehran .
The security council is unlikely to meet until after talks between the EU foreign affairs chief , Javier Solana , and Iran 's head of national security , Ali Larijani .
They spoke by telephone yesterday and agreed to a face - to - face meeting soon , possibly within days .
Mr Bush , underlining Washington 's increasing impatience , said Tehran had reacted with defiance and delaying tactics in response to the UN deadline .
"" It is time for Iran to make a choice , "" he told a convention of US veterans .
"" We 've made our choice .
We will continue to work closely with our allies to find a diplomatic solution , but there must be consequences for Iran 's defiance and we must not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon . ""
John Bolton , Washington 's hawkish ambassador to the UN , said it was time for the security council to draw up sanctions against Tehran .
The IAEA report showed "" ample evidence "" of Iran 's defiance and obstructionism , he said , along with activities that would be "" simply inexplicable if their real purpose [ were ] a peaceful nuclear power programme "" .
The security council , after three years of protracted negotiations with Iran , on July 31 agreed a resolution imposing a deadline of August 31 for Tehran to suspend its uranium enrichment programme , which the west sees as a step towards achieving a nuclear weapons capability .
Iran says its nuclear programme is purely for civilian purposes .
President Ahmadinejad , in a speech at Orumiyeh , said : "" The Iranian nation will not succumb to bullying , invasion and the violation of its rights . ""
He said enemies of the country were trying to stir up differences among the Iranian people , but "" I tell them ' you are wrong .
The Iranian nation is united ' .
"" The Iranian government claims the US and European countries are covertly trying to undermine it by stirring up ethnic unrest .
As well as finding that Iran had failed to suspend uranium enrichment , the IAEA report expressed concern about new findings of minute particles of highly - enriched uranium at a university involved in possible military work .
It also said that the Iranians were no longer allowing it access to suspicious diagrams related to a warhead , and that there had been a bar , albeit temporary , on allowing the IAEA inspectors access to an underground facility .
Muhammad Saeedi , the deputy head of Iran 's nuclear programme , offered a different interpretation of the IAEA report from that of the US and the EU , insisting that it had failed to prove that Tehran 's intentions were anything other than peaceful .
He said the report confirmed that Iran had been working within the legal guidelines set down by the UN nuclear watchdog . ""
Generally , although this report has not fully satisfied us , it shows that America 's propaganda and politically motivated claims over Iran 's nuclear programme are baseless and based on American officials ' hallucinations , "" he told Iran 's official news agency IRNA .
FAQ What happens now ?
UN resolution 1696 says that if Iran fails to comply with the deadline the "" intention "" was to adopt "" appropriate measures "" under article 41 : the article that deals with sanctions .
Will sanctions be imposed ?
Of the five permanent members , the US wants sanctions almost immediately , Britain and France are prepared to allow for further talks , and Russia and China want to slow the process even further .
Discussions could begin next week and may take months .
What sanctions are likely ?
Relatively light ones that would target ministers , officials and scientists in the form of travel bans and a freeze on foreign assets .
What would be the consequences ?
Iran could respond by withdrawing from the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty , barring UN inspectors .
And in the longer - term ?
Iran holds most of the cards .
But the US still has options , the most extreme of which would be a military strike on Iranian nuclear plants .
An alternative would be to stir up Iran 's minorities , a move Tehran fears .
If Russia and China refuse to back sanctions , the US could organise a coalition of willing countries , including Britain , France and Germany , to join it in implementing sanctions .
Or America could open direct negotiations with Tehran ."
2006-09-01,"No one was surprised this week when Iran failed to meet the UN 's deadline to halt uranium enrichment .
From President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad downwards , Iranian officials had made it defiantly clear long in advance that there would be no backing down on this key demand .
But the predictability of the event does not mean it does not matter .
By ignoring the UN security council and its nuclear agency , the IAEA , Iran is cocking a snook at the rest of the world over an issue of profound importance : the danger that nuclear weapons will spread in the already volatile Middle East and encourage others elsewhere to follow suit .
Tehran insists it wishes only to use nuclear power to generate electricity as it is entitled to do under the nuclear non - proliferation treaty .
The problem is that few believe that because of its long record of evasion and concealment , and evidence that what it is doing only makes sense if its true goals are military .
Still , a US senate committee pointed recently to gaps in the intelligence picture of Iran as big as those which were uncovered after the war in Iraq .
Iran may be short on trust , but otherwise it is in an enviable position .
The Islamic Republic emerged the clear winner from the US invasion of Afghanistan and the overthrow of the Taliban .
In Iraq the demise of Iran 's hated Ba'athist enemy has brought the country 's Shia Muslim majority to power in Baghdad .
Now the war in Lebanon between ( nuclear - armed ) Israel and Iran 's protege Hizbullah has exposed the limits of conventional power in defeating well - equipped Shia fighters who are riding a wave of hostility to Israel and the US .
For some , the whole dismal episode was an ominous dress - rehearsal for what might happen if Iran itself ever came under attack .
And Iran knows too that cutting its oil exports could trigger another 1970s - style shock that would be devastating to the world economy .
Mr Ahmadinejad and colleagues can also see that with Iraq bleeding , none in the US except the most diehard neocons have any appetite for regime change in Tehran , though some in Washington think there is a military option .
Israel , its suspicions of Iran sharpened in Lebanon , has signalled it might try a rerun of the bombing of Iraq 's nuclear reactor in 1981 .
International law , military effectiveness and political sense should all rule that out .
Iran 's intransigence means that sanctions will now be considered by the security council but will be very hard to agree .
The fragile unity that produced a UN - endorsed package of economic and technological incentives for Iran is unlikely to survive for long .
Russia and China have made clear their opposition to punitive measures .
Britain and France , backed by the EU , both said yesterday that they saw the need for more diplomacy .
In a situation where there are so few good options , simply playing for time is n't a bad choice .
Sanctions would in any case almost certainly be counter - productive and useless if not multilateral .
( Bilateral US sanctions , it is worth recalling , have been in force since after the revolution in 1979 ) .
The smarter choice would be to take up Iran 's offer of "" serious negotiations "" to test whether it might halt enrichment by some other route - though that would have to include a tight UN inspections regime to allay suspicions .
Any such effort should be accompanied by intensified contacts with Tehran .
The current visit to the US of the former Iranian president .
Mohammed Khatami . is a timely reminder of his call for a "" dialogue of civilisations "" in 1998 .
But he may not even meet Jimmy Carter , let alone George Bush .
Iranian confidence , international divisions and the sheer importance of what is at stake here make this a fiendishly difficult tangle .
That must be a spur to creativity , not a counsel of despair .
Like it or not , Iran 's nuclear defiance poses a huge challenge to the battered credibility of the UN .
It can not just be ignored ."
2006-09-03,"The UN secretary - general Kofi Annan began a visit to Iran yesterday as the country 's President , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , vowed to pursue its nuclear programme , which the West fears is aimed at developing atomic weapons .
The visit came two days after Iran failed to meet a UN deadline for suspending its enrichment of uranium , paving the way for possible sanctions against the Islamic republic ."
2006-09-04,"Kofi Annan , the UN secretary general , eased the pressure on Iran over its nuclear programme yesterday when he stopped short of condemning it for ignoring an international deadline to suspend uranium enrichment and appeared to accept a key part of its negotiating stance .
Speaking in Tehran at the end of a two - day visit , Mr Annan 's comments contrasted with those of President George Bush , who demanded "" consequences "" after Iran missed last week 's UN security council ultimatum .
Mr Annan said that he understood the issue better after meeting senior Iranian officials , including President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Ali Larijani , Iran 's chief nuclear negotiator , and the foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki .
His comments followed an International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) report which confirmed that Iran had defied a UN resolution to freeze uranium enrichment , a process that can be used to make atomic bombs .
The agency also said it had been unable to confirm Iran 's claim that its nuclear programme was peaceful because of a lack of cooperation .
The west believes the programme is designed to produce nuclear weapons .
But rather than rebuke Tehran , Mr Annan pointed to an assurance from Mr Ahmadinejad that Iran wanted compromise .
"" The president reaffirmed to me Iran 's preparedness and determination to negotiate and find a solution to the crisis , "" Mr Annan told a press conference .
He said Mr Ahmadinejad had told him that Iran "" does not accept suspension [ of uranium enrichment ] before negotiations "" .
But he added : "" Iran has said it is open for negotiations .
All issues can be discussed at the negotiations .
"" That comment appeared to mirror Iran 's position that the demand for suspension should be included in general negotiations and not set as a precondition .
Mr Annan 's remarks came in the face of a US - led clamour for sanctions .
They appeared destined to further slow the momentum after EU foreign ministers gave Tehran another two weeks to clarify its position and called for negotiations .
The security council is expected to meet soon to discuss a new resolution that could include punitive measures .
But hard - hitting sanctions are unlikely because of the opposition of Russia and China , which have strong economic ties to Tehran .
Mr Annan also said he had secured Iran 's support for the UN - brokered ceasefire in Lebanon .
He said Iran had promised to work with the UN to help rebuild Lebanon 's shattered infrastructure .
But no mention was made of Tehran 's relationship with Hizbullah , which it is generally accepted used weapons supplied by Iran .
In a pointed reproach , Mr Annan condemned a cartoon exhibition in Tehran satirising the Holocaust , which Mr Ahmadinejad last year described as a "" myth "" .
"" I think the tragedy of the Holocaust is a sad and an undeniable historical fact so we should really handle that , accept that fact and teach children what happened in world war two and ensure that it is never repeated , "" he said .
The exhibition was organised by Iran 's biggest - selling newspaper , Hamshari , in retaliation for the publication of Danish cartoons depicting the prophet Mohammed in European newspapers earlier this year ."
2006-09-05,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's outspoken president , fired an ominous warning at the country 's educated elites yesterday by calling for a purge of "" liberal and secular "" academics in the universities .
In what some analysts interpreted as the start of a clampdown , Mr Ahmadinejad derided secular lecturers as a fifth column of western colonialism which he said was seeking to expand into Iran . ""
Today students should protest and shout at the president asking why some liberal and secular professors are still present in the universities , "" he told a gathering of young scientists .
"" Our educational system has been under the influence of the secular system for 150 years .
Colonialism is seeking the spread of its own secular system . ""
While acknowledging it was difficult to change this system , he said : "" Such a change has begun . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad , a hardline Islamist , also said his government had tried to reduce the political influence of university chancellors , many of whom were seen as pillars of the reformist government of his predecessor , Mohammad Khatami . ""
A political predominance existed among many of the university chancellors but we have tried to reduce it because we do n't believe chancellors should enter into politics at all , "" Mr Ahmadinejad said .
The president 's salvo recalled previous outbursts against ideological targets , including a call for Israel to be "" wiped off the map "" and a demand for western music to be barred from Iran 's airwaves .
His latest comments will intensify fears among student and faculty members of an incipient crackdown .
In recent months , several student activists have been imprisoned and dozens of liberal lecturers forced to retire before the statutory age .
Last year , Mr Ahmadinejad appointed a radical cleric as chancellor of Tehran university , the country 's most prestigious institution .
The government has also buried "" martyrs "" from the 1988 Iran - Iraq war in some universities in what activists see as an excuse to allow security forces on to campuses to keep watch on the student body .
Iran 's Islamic authorities have kept universities under close surveillance since a wave of student protests demanding greater freedom in 1999 .
A student leader , Akbar Mohammadi , died in jail in July after a hunger strike started in protest at being reimprisoned following a long - term release on medical grounds .
Some critics saw Mr Ahmadinejad 's remarks as presaging a general repression of internal critics under the cloak of Iran 's confrontation with the west over its nuclear programme .
The government 's official spokesman appeared to herald such a move recently by instructing judges to prosecute journalists who published "" lies "" about the government
But Professor Sadegh Zibakalam , a political scientist at Tehran university , dismissed suggestions of an imminent purge . ""
Ahmadinejad is a populist trying to create a charismatic image for himself , "" he said .
"" These comments are aimed at those who voted for him and perhaps designed to divert attention from Iran 's economic problems .
They do n't mean there is an orchestrated plot against more liberal lecturers . """

Stephen Chernin / GettyFor most of the world leaders who will address the UN general assembly , beginning later today in New York , it will be an honour , or at least a chance to put across their views to a global audience .
But for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad it could well end up being a deeply mystical experience , writes Peter Walker .
In comments circulated on bootleg CD - roms and the internet after his debut appearance at the UN general assembly last year , the 49-year - old Iranian president was captured on videotape saying he had been told by a witness that when he made his speech he was surrounded by an aura - like halo of light .
"" I felt it myself .
I felt that the atmosphere suddenly changed , and for those 27 or 28 minutes , all the leaders of the world did not blink .
When I say they did n't move an eyelid , I 'm not exaggerating . ""
Unfortunately for Mr Ahmadinejad , the wide - eyed looks from some fellow leaders were less religious rapture and more horrified disbelief as the newly - elected president hailed Iran 's "" inalienable right "" to produce nuclear fuel and invited private companies to share the technology .
Hence the slight trepidation at this year 's event , where the magic of scheduling has placed Mr Ahmadinejad only just down today 's running order from George Bush , who begins speaking at 11.30am local time ( 4.30 pm in the UK ) .
The halo is not likely to reappear -
Mr Ahmadinejad seems sensitive about the issue and earlier this month an Iranian reformist newspaper was temporarily closed after publishing a cartoon appearing to make fun of the event .
However , as a man who has repeatedly called into question the Holocaust - in an interview this month with Time magazine , he demanded more "" independent research "" first - and called for the destruction of Israel , MR Ahmedinejad does n't really do conciliatory speeches .
Mr Bush might face a few wide eyes himself , not to mention some raised eyebrows , judging by previews of his address .
Despite yesterday 's warning by UN secretary general that Iraq could soon slide into civil war , the US leader is expected to expound a defiantly upbeat message .
Mr Bush will explain "" the bright , democratic future that we see for the Middle East in contra - distinction to some who have almost a backward - looking vision for that region , "" one senior administration told reporters .
Away from the speeches , of course , there is one other key objective for Mr Bush 's aides - making sure their man does n't accidentally bump into the Iranian president .
Photographers scour such gatherings in the hope of preserving for posterity the grimace of distaste as a leader or minister grudgingly shakes hands with an eager despot - for example Jack Straw 's encounter with Robert Mugabe at the general assembly in 2004 .
But help is at hand , in the unlikely shape of a 2004 Patriarche Pere and Fils Pouilly Fuisse and a 2004 Chateau Grand Moulinet Pomerol .
According to The Times , these are the wines that will be served at today 's lunch for 144 world leaders and their foreign ministers , although Mr Bush himself , an ex - drinker , will not partake personally .
And luckily for him , the devoutly Muslim Mr Ahmadinejad has said he will not attend the lunch because alcohol is being served ."
2006-09-20,"The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Friday September 22 2006
In the article below we refer to a stand - off between the US and Iran over the latter 's "" nuclear weapons programme "" .
We should have said simply "" nuclear programme "" , or in that context perhaps "" alleged nuclear weapons programme "" .
The intensifying war of words between Iran and the United States reached the floor of the United Nations last night when the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , accused America and Britain of violating international law .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's speech only once directly referred to the United States , but was infused throughout with criticism of the "" exclusionist policies "" of what he called the "" hegemonic power "" and its grip over the UN through its membership of the security council .
"" The question needs to be asked : if the governments of the United States or the United Kingdom who are permanent members of the security council , commit aggression , occupation and violation of international law , which of the organs of the UN can take them to account ? "" he said .
Hours earlier , at the same lectern , President George Bush accused the Tehran regime of supporting terrorism .
He told the Iranian people that the greatest obstacle to a free future came from their own rulers , who had "" chosen to deny you liberty and to use your nation 's resources to fund terrorism , and fuel extremism , and pursue nuclear weapons "" .
Mr Bush has refused to meet the Iranian president this week .
The criticism levelled at each other by the two leaders at the general assembly , separated by only seven hours , highlighted the increasingly tense stand - off between the two countries over Iran 's nuclear weapons programme .
Mr Ahmadinejad made no reference to Iran 's nuclear activities , instead reminding delegates that America had itself used the bomb .
He accused the US of using terrorism as a "" pretext for the continued presence of foreign forces in Iraq "" .
He also criticised Washington 's support for Israel , and accused the UN security council of sitting "" idly by for many days "" while atrocities were committed in Lebanon this summer .
In his 15-minute address , President Bush chose to speak over the heads of several world leaders seated before him in the general assembly chamber in New York and address their people directly .
He challenged the delegations not just from Iran , but also Syria and Sudan .
He invoked the interests of "" ordinary men and women free to determine their own destiny "" and expressed his desire for a world in which "" the extremists are marginalised by the peaceful majority "" .
Mr Bush 's speech was the last in a series he has given around the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks .
The addresses were conceived by the White House as an attempt to regain control of the political agenda and steer it away from the troubles in Iraq towards the need to stand firm in the so - called war on terror .
But Mr Bush spoke against a troubled backdrop .
Earlier Kofi Annan , making his last speech to the general assembly as UN secretary general before he steps down at the end of this year , painted a grim picture , saying the past 10 years had "" not resolved , but sharpened "" the problems of an unjust global economy , disorder , and contempt for human rights .
"" We face a world whose divisions threaten the very notion of an international community upon which this institution stands , "" he said .
Mr Bush denied that his administration was anti - Muslim and dismissed criticism that US efforts to spread democracy in the region were backfiring . ""
The reality is that the stability we thought we saw in the Middle East was a mirage .
For decades , millions of men and women in the region had been trapped in oppression and hopelessness .
And these conditions left a generation disillusioned and made this region a breeding ground for extremism . ""
Addressing himself "" to the people of Iran "" , he said he admired their rich history and vibrant culture , and said they deserved an opportunity to determine their own future .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's aggressive speech adds further heat to the dispute over Iran 's nuclear programme that is dominating discussions at the UN .
The French president , Jacques Chirac , told the general assembly that "" dialogue must prevail .
Our goal is not to call regimes into question . ""
Mr Chirac met Mr Bush yesterday morning in a bridge - building meeting after cracks in their strategy towards Iran appeared to open up .
On Monday Mr Chirac , speaking on French radio , took a notably softer stance on the need for Iran to suspend enrichment before talks could begin - a key demand of Washington .
The US and British governments have so far been unbending on this condition .
Following their meeting , the US and French leaders insisted their position was united ."
2006-09-20,"President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's forthright criticism of the United Nations was not aimed at the UN itself but at the way the security council is manipulated by the great powers , primarily the United States , to further their own policy objectives .
And who is to say he is wrong ?
The problem for George Bush and those within his administration who have been working overtime lately to portray Iran 's leadership as the single biggest threat to global security is that many if not most people , and most member countries of the comparatively powerless UN general assembly , will agree with Mr Ahmadinejad .
It is certainly hard to argue against his view that the US , backed to his shame by Tony Blair , actively obstructed UN efforts to secure an early ceasefire in Israel 's July war on Lebanon .
A British Foreign Office minister has since admitted that this was probably the wrong course of action .
But that is no consolation to the relatives of the hundreds of civilians who died because Israel was not reined in earlier .
It is equally hard to fault Mr Ahmadinejad 's condemnation of the failure of the occupying powers in Iraq , again principally the US and Britain , to establish any resemblance of security there amid horrendous daily bloodshed .
It hardly needs to be pointed out that this disaster began in 2003 when the US and Britain ignored the UN and launched an illegal invasion .
Iraq was one of the very few major issues in recent times on which Washington did not get its way at the UN .
By rejecting the security council majority 's position , it did exactly what it now accuses Iran 's government of doing over the nuclear issue .
In fact , Mr Ahmadinejad and his government have repeatedly offered resumed negotiations on the nuclear dossier .
What they object to , reasonably enough , is the US - British - French demand , pushed through the security council , that Iran suspend enrichment activities as a precondition for new talks .
Washington 's haste in trying to push this problem towards a confrontation involving punitive UN - mandated sanctions is reminiscent of the run - up to the Iraq war when the US refused to give more time for UN weapons inspectors to complete their work .
"" If they [ the US and Britain ] have differences with a nation or state , they drag it to the security council , "" Mr Ahmadinejad said .
They then assign themselves the roles of "" prosecutor , judge and executioner ...
Is this just , "" he asked .
The answer is no , it is not - and it both damages the UN and is frequently counter - productive .
Iran 's policies can be criticised on many fronts .
The role it played in supporting Hizbullah against Israel was not matched by timely efforts on its part to persuade the Lebanese militia to support a quick ceasefire .
Its role in Iraq is open to question , although massive instability on its border is not in Tehran 's interest .
And given its track record , it is entirely reasonable to question the credibility of Iran 's denials concerning the purpose of its nuclear programmes .
But on every front , Mr Bush and his Downing Street and Tel Aviv supporters are undermining effective action to assuage these concerns by greatly exaggerating their case , indulging in ever more hostile rhetoric , refusing direct talks , effectively encouraging regime change in Iran - and bending the UN to their will .
More broadly they have also shown little meaningful support for Kofi Annan 's reform panel 's recent recommendations on how to make the UN , and particularly the security council , work more efficiently .
The recommendations included expanding council membership to make it more representative of today 's world , rather than that of 1945 .
A reformed council that was not constantly dominated by five veto - wielding countries might have a better chance of effectively addressing pressing international geo - political issues such as nuclear proliferation , terrorism , Iraq , Israel 's relations with its neighbours , Sudan , Burma and Afghanistan .
By keeping things as they are , ( while often harshly attacking the failings of the UN as an organisation ) , the US adds force to Mr Ahmadinejad 's argument that the security council has become Washington 's creature - and a rubber stamp for self - interest ."
2006-09-20,"As the Iranian and American presidents offer their rival versions of international reality at the United Nations this week , it is worth recalling that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is not the first Iranian leader to travel to New York to proclaim his country 's right to make its own decisions about energy resources , to denounce imperialism , and to condemn a world order weighted in favour of a handful of powerful nations .
In this same month in 1951 , Dr Mohammad Mossadeq convinced the UN that British efforts to regain control of the oil industry the Iranian government had just nationalised did not deserve the world body 's support .
Mossadeq won over the security council , and he won over the United States , which enjoyed the spectacle of this elderly , eccentric and eloquent man challenging the British empire .
American reporters affectionately nicknamed him "" Old Mossy "" .
How different is the scene at the UN today , with Bush castigating Iran for political suppression at home , for supporting terrorism abroad , and for pursuing nuclear weapons , while Ahmadinejad portrays the US as the leader of a group of nations which have hijacked international institutions in pursuit of their own narrow interests .
Between these two moments on the East River lies a half century in which the US was transformed , in Iranian eyes , from the angel in international affairs that Mossadeq had imagined into the demon scourged by Ayatollah Khomeini and most of his successors .
"" Old Mossy "" hoped America would help Iran become truly independent .
Instead , America joined Britain in removing him from power and ensconcing the Shah as an authoritarian ruler .
Most Iranians , including opponents of the regime , think the US has never redeemed itself for that act , or for its later meddling in Iranian affairs .
American intervention would reach a malign climax , they say , if the US were to attack Iranian nuclear installations .
Just as Iranians believe the US has never made up for the wrong it perpetrated in 1953 , so Americans believe the Islamic republic demonstrated , by its seizure of American diplomats in 1979 , a deeply unreasonable and probably permanent hostility towards America .
The two nations , in other words , bulk pathologically large in each other 's vision , and that is the ultimate problem which makes an accommodation between them on nuclear matters , let alone a more general rapprochement , so difficult to achieve .
The drama which began three years ago when Britain , France and Germany undertook to bring Iran round on the nuclear issue has had its comic dimension , as European wiliness encountered Iranian guile , and was usually outmatched by it .
But now comedy threatens to tip over into farce , and tragedy lies in wait .
After the passing of many deadlines , the latest at the end of last month , the Iranians are still enriching uranium .
They have so far suffered no consequences , and even if a very modest package of sanctions were to survive Russian and Chinese objections at the UN , it would not hurt the Iranians much , if at all .
The western bluff has been called .
The Europeans have moved from making suspension a condition for talks to contriving formulas to allow talks to begin without it .
As long as serious sanctions lay in the far future , the Europeans were ready to act as if they , and even the highly sceptical Russians and Chinese , would be prepared to take strong measures .
But as soon as they become a real prospect , the excuses emerge , ranging from the lack of adequate inducements to the absence of conclusive proof of Iran 's nuclear intentions and the danger of pushing the Tehran regime into too tight a corner .
All have some substance , but nevertheless represent a retreat from previous positions .
In the unlikely event that strong sanctions were imposed , Iran would find it relatively easy to survive them , and they would play into the hands of those in the Iranian government , including Ahmadinejad , who may well believe that a good relationship with the west is a contradiction in terms - something that would sully the revolutionary purity of the republic .
So there are indeed reasons for caution on sanctions .
In any case the real sanction has been the prospect that if negotiations were to end in total failure , they would be followed , no doubt after a period in which economic measures would be shown to be ineffective , by American military action .
The bunker - busters would go in and parts of Iran would be dug up and ploughed under by a bombing campaign , aimed both at destroying installations and killing scientists , which would set back Iran 's nuclear programme by three or four years .
Yet even if the Bush administration was less weakened by Iraq than it is , the chances of it choosing this option are somewhat less than they may have seemed some months ago .
There is no readiness in the country to accept another military enterprise , even if it "" only "" involved air action , and anyone ordering it would suffer grievous political damage .
This would come not so much in the campaign itself , but with the inevitable retaliation by Iran in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East .
The US government would be wide open to the charge of making a bad mess worse , and the charge would be true , something which it may now be beginning to grasp .
It will not rule out the counter - proliferation option , and the American military will continue to plan for it on a contingency basis , but the Iranians are probably right to conclude that it is not a very immediate threat .
But it is in the nature of the relationship between Iran and the west that as one danger recedes , another advances .
If the Iranian regime comes to believe that both the Europeans and the US are paper tigers , it will be both strengthened and emboldened .
At home , the consequences may well be to quicken the pace of the regime 's encroachments on the freedom and democracy the Iranian system still displays .
Abroad , they could give a push to the sort of adventurism which would make war between Iran and the US a stronger possibility .
The only answer is a Middle Eastern policy which stresses needs , rights and fairness more than threats and enemies .
Easy generalities , but somewhere in that direction lies the solution , if there is one to be found .

2006-09-21,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , today insisted that his country did not need nuclear weapons and had no plans to develop them .
Speaking at a news conference at the UN headquarters in New York , Mr Ahmadinejad said that Tehran 's nuclear programme is peaceful and he is "" at a loss "" about what more he can do to provide guarantees .
He said : "" The bottom line is we do not need a bomb . ""
The president said Iran 's uranium enrichment programme was in line with the framework of the Nuclear Non - Proliferation treaty and denied that nuclear weapons facilities had been hidden from UN inspectors .
Mr Ahmadinejad said talks with the European Union about Tehran 's nuclear programme were "" on the right path "" and , in a thinly veiled reference to the US , added that he hoped no one would disrupt them .
"" We believe those negotiations are moving on the right path .
Hopefully others will not disrupt the work - in small ways perhaps .
It is a constructive path to take , "" he said .
Responding to UN security council demands , Mr Ahmadinejad said Iran was prepared to negotiate on suspending uranium enrichment "" under fair and just conditions "" but he gave no time frame for doing so .
His comments came just two days after he accused the US and UK of violating international law .
Addressing the floor of the UN on Tuesday , he criticised the power both countries exercised over the UN through their membership of the security council ."

Jason DeCrow / APYou would n't think they need it , but for the world 's presidents and prime ministers the annual meeting of the UN general assembly is an excellent chance to strut their stuff on a global stage .
George Bush gets to make the case for the US 's democratic mission in the Middle East and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad can accuse the US and Britain of being lawbreakers .
As if that was n't enough for him , the New York Times reports on the Iranian president 's confrontational meeting with a US foreign policy thinktank .
By the sound of things , he seemed to enjoy it . ""
He entered a hotel conference room on the East Side with a jaunty smile , a wave and an air of supreme confidence . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad [ ... ] squared off with the nation 's foreign policy establishment , parrying questions for an hour and three - quarters with two dozen members of the Council on Foreign Relations then ending the evening by asking whether they were simply shills for the Bush administration .

Some thanks , Oscar - style , are necessary here - it simply would not have been possible without the contributions of Jacques Chirac , Dick Cheney and Silvio Berlusconi .
Try it and see how you do .
And feel free to recount great political slanging matches in the comments below ."
2006-09-21,"It is unconventional for New York press conferences to begin with a recital of the Qur'an , but then the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran is anything but conventional .
"" I thank God the Almighty for giving me an opportunity to meet with my friends once again , "" he said at the start of yesterday 's address , having recited several verses .
In an hour of questioning from the media , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad talked about Iran 's nuclear programme , his attitude to Israel and his views on America .
Smiling broadly , he invoked the prophet Moses , said he loved everyone around including Jews and apologised to New York for the traffic problems caused by this week 's UN general assembly .
As the annual assembly approaches the end of its first week , Mr Ahmadinejad appears to be stealing the show .
He has appeared on CBS and CNN television , had a bilateral meeting with Romano Prodi , Italy 's prime minister , and addressed the august thinktank , the Council on Foreign Relations .
If the White House was hoping he would come to New York , deliver his 15-minute speech to the assembly on Tuesday and then quietly go , they hoped wrong .
Iran 's president began the substantial part of the press conference by adopting George Bush 's technique .
On Tuesday Mr Bush spoke to the people of Iran , ignoring the delegation from Tehran in the assembly chamber .
Mr Ahmadinejad spoke to the people of America , saying he regretted that he had not had the chance to meet and talk to them directly .
He was quick to point out the failings of the US administration towards its own people .
"" My country offered help to the victims of Katrina , "" he said , "" when we saw bodies floating in the water and the homeless . ""
Asked about political prisoners in Iran , he replied : "" There are 219 million people in the US and 68 million people in Iran .
There are 3 million prisoners in the US and 130,000 in Iran .
The percentage is much higher . ""
At the Council on Foreign Relations on Wednesday night , Mr Ahmadinejad proved to be a formidable interlocutor for some of America 's most experienced minds on international affairs .
He ended the session by asking whether the thinktank 's members were speaking for the Bush administration .
The decision to invite him to speak to the institution caused some of its members to refuse to attend .
With Iran 's nuclear programme dominating the backstage diplomacy at the UN this week , Mr Ahmadinejad consistently denied that Tehran was involved in developing the bomb .
"" The bottom line is we do n't need the bomb .
Some people think you can deal with problems through the bomb , and they are wrong , "" he said .
He accused America of being hostile towards his country for 27 years and said Washington 's stance was hypocritical , "" coming from the country which has an immense stockpile of nuclear bombs and even today is developing a new , more frightening , generation of bombs "" .
Only once did he raise his voice a little .
"" We will stand up when we are oppressed and when people try and impose their will on us .
We will never permit that , never permit that , "" he said .
He spoke of his belief in "" love and peace "" and dismissed the portrayal of him in the west , even slipping into the third person . ""
Even if Ahmadinejad , even if I were a person who would keep my silence , do you think injustice would go unnoticed ?
"" he asked .
He offered conciliatory words for Israel .
"" We love everybody around the world : Jews , Christians , Muslims ... "" Minutes later he qualified his words : "" Zionists are not Jews .
Zionists are Zionists , "" he said ."
2006-10-04,"Iran 's reformist ex - president Mohammad Khatami is to visit Britain this month in a move that is certain to infuriate hardline supporters of his successor , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Mr Khatami , admired in the west for his attempts to liberalise Iran 's theocracy during his eight - year presidency , will open a new Iranian studies department at St Andrews University and receive an honorary PhD from the Liberal Democrat leader , Menzies Campbell , on October 31 .
He will also speak at Chatham House , the London - based foreign affairs thinktank .
The former president will be the most senior Iranian political figure to visit Britain since the last shah , Mohammed Reza Pahlavi , who came 34 years ago and was toppled in the 1979 Islamic revolution .
The visit comes as Britain and the US push for sanctions against Iran for defying a UN resolution demanding that it halt a key part of its nuclear programme .
Iran 's state - run TV reported yesterday that Mr Ahmadinejad had ordered nuclear facilities to be opened up to foreign tourists to show that the programme is peaceful .
Mr Khatami 's visit follows last month 's trip to the US during which he met former president Jimmy Carter .
The trip was bitterly criticised by religious conservatives in Iran and by Jewish groups in the US .
Fatemeh Rajabi , the wife of Mr Ahmadinejad 's government spokesman , denounced Mr Khatami as a "" mercenary "" who had gone there to get "" rewards for the eight years of implementing American plots disguised as reforms "" .
The hardline newspaper Kayhan also criticised the trip as inappropriate in light of the nuclear dispute .
Visiting Britain , seen by many Iranians as an even greater enemy than the US , is bound to provoke equally fierce condemnation .
Mr Ahmadinejad routinely singles out Britain in his denunciations of western policies .
Mr Khatami , who has called for the nuclear issue to be resolved "" tactfully "" , prompted a thaw in Anglo - Iranian relations during the 1990s when he said the controversy over Salman Rushdie 's book
The Satanic Verses was "" completely finished "" - effectively lifting a death sentence declared by the late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ."
2006-10-04,"Iran 's reformist ex - president Mohammad Khatami is to visit Britain this month in a move certain to infuriate hardline supporters of his successor , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Mr Khatami , who won admiration in the west for his attempts to liberalise Iran 's theocratic political system during his eight - year presidency , will open a new Iranian studies department at St Andrews University and receive an honorary PhD from the Liberal Democrat leader , Menzies Campbell , on October 31 .
He will also speak at Chatham House , the London - based foreign affairs thinktank .
The former president will be the most senior Iranian political figure to visit Britain since the last shah , Mohammed Reza Pahlavi , who was toppled in the 1979 Islamic revolution , came 34 years ago .
It comes at a time when Britain , along with the US , is pressing for sanctions against Iran for defying a UN resolution demanding that it halt a key part of its nuclear programme , which the west fears is aimed at building atomic bombs .
Iran 's state - run television reported today that Mr Ahmadinejad had ordered the country 's nuclear facilities to be opened up to foreign tourists to show that its programme was peaceful .
Mr Khatami 's visit follows last month 's highly controversial trip to the US , during which he met the former US president Jimmy Carter .
That visit was bitterly criticised by religious conservatives in Iran and by Jewish and emigre Jewish groups in the US .
Fatemeh Rajabi , the wife of Mr Ahmadinejad 's official government spokesman , denounced Mr Khatami as a "" mercenary "" who had gone to the US to get "" rewards for the eight years of implementing American plots disguised as reforms "" .
The hardline newspaper Kayhan also criticised the trip as inappropriate in light of the nuclear dispute .
Visiting Britain , seen by many Iranians as an even greater enemy than the US , is bound to provoke equally fierce condemnation .
Mr Ahmadinejad routinely singles out Britain in his frequent denunciations of western policies .
In contrast to Mr Ahmadinejad 's confrontational approach , Mr Khatami has called for the nuclear issue to be resolved "" tactfully "" .
Britain has been historically distrusted by many Iranians because of its monopoly of the country 's oil industry during the 20th century .
Mr Khatami prompted a thaw in Anglo - Iranian relations during the 90s when he declared the controversy over the British novelist Salman Rushdie "" completely finished "" .
His comments were interpreted as lifting the death sentence imposed by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , spiritual leader of the Islamic revolution , in retaliation for Rushdie 's novel The Satanic Verses .
Mr Khatami 's declaration in turn led to a restoration of diplomatic ties between Iran and Britain ."
2006-10-05,"One of my least happy moments as the Foreign Office 's spokesman was to discover that a press officer had called the new president of Iran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , a nutcase .
This seemed a terrible breach of the usual courtesies , and bound to lead to difficult consequences for Britain 's relationship with Iran .
I never did receive a complaint from Tehran though .
Since taking office , President Ahmadinejad has given the impression of revelling in the shock and awe that he induces in European , American and , especially , Israeli audiences .
The main flaw in my press officer 's analysis turned out to be not that it caused offence , but that it was wrong .
If only President Ahmadinejad could be dismissed so lightly .
I 'm very struck by the more thoughtful analysis of the Ahmadinejad phenomenon in Ali Ansari 's new book , Confronting Iran .
Dr Ansari believes the Iranian president 's aim is not to force concessions : "" On the contrary , a state of continued tension and confrontation was desirable , and the criticism of the west was to be actively sought ...
it merely confirmed the righteousness of Iran 's position .
"" This is a view that ought to be digested very thoroughly before the next round of "" tension and confrontation "" gets under way .
It strikes me as perceptive and disturbing .
It is one thing to negotiate with someone who is extremely tough , utterly ruthless and even unscrupulous .
That kind of negotiation can lead to a successful outcome if conducted with skill , nerve and strength .
It is quite another to deal with someone who is coolly bargaining for rupture as a rational act of policy .
That seems to me to be the right way of reading this flippantly aggressive figure , who talks almost casually of eliminating Israel .
It is not that President Ahmadinejad happens to be difficult to be reasonable with - he is purposefully working to achieve a state of permanent aggravation .
If so , the policy the UN security council has embarked on is precisely what Ahmadinejad wants .
So should we give it to him ?
The word that leaps out of Dr Ansari 's description is that western criticism of Iran confirms the righteousness of Iran 's position .
President Ahmadinejad looks increasingly like a deceptively shrewd populist who has calculated that a diplomatic confrontation is precisely what he needs .
Is there not a high risk that the sanctions , which are designed to increase the pressure on Iran , instead ease the pressure on its president ?
Is there not a warning here that he will delight in the very measures that are meant to dismay him ?
Is there not a danger that he will exploit the penalties that are supposed to restrict him ?
These are risks that must be avoided if the sanctions path has to be taken .
The one thing President Ahmadinejad has to dread is a lowering of tensions .
He is not a leader who can thrive in a flat calm .
This is a president who needs a cause on which he can rally the country to extremism .
He needs a unifying grievance , and he sees it in a defiant pursuit of nuclear research .
There are some who will say that such a man should be confronted , and that case is no doubt being put forcefully in Washington .
It was unnerving to hear Gordon Correra 's thoroughly researched documentary on Radio 4 last week , in which he told a plausible story that the previous , more reasonable , Iranian leadership offered a deal to the Bush administration in 2003 .
Tehran would be open about its nuclear programme and Washington would remove Iran from the "" axis of evil "" .
According to one version quoted by the BBC , vice - president Dick Cheney ruled that America does not talk to evil .
If that is true , then it reassures me that Jack Straw did the right thing in going to Tehran around that time to talk to the Iranians , along with Joschka Fischer of Germany and Dominique de Villepin of France .
That kind of highly staged diplomacy may well have no purpose if Iran has a president who sees rising tension as a righteous cause .
But that does not mean we should abandon diplomacy altogether .
On the contrary , there is a subtler approach that becomes more urgent all the time .
I would argue that , as Britain and its allies seek United Nations agreement to sanctions , the effort must be redoubled to offer Iran a non - confrontational relationship : and be seen to offer it vigorously .
I have not noticed much effort since the Vienna agreement in May to publicise its contents , which include generous offers to support Iran 's legitimate pursuit of civil nuclear power .
It is especially important to make that point over and over , loud and clear , to Muslims .
The real battle with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad should be to deny him the easy role he is allotting himself as the heroic defender of a proud nation being denied its rights by the American bully and its friends on the security council .
Britain is making some effort to counter his propaganda by pointing out that sanctions will be reversible if Iran responds to the reasonable offer made .
But far more must be done to persuade Muslim audiences , and Iranians themselves , that this is a dispute which could be settled quite simply on terms that benefit Iran , if only the president of Iran would allow that to happen .
Of course , that argument also requires the president of the United States to make clear that he would be happy with a settlement that benefits Iran .
In theory , President Bush supports an outcome in which Iran gets all the civil nuclear power it needs , with our technical help .
But it is hard to see him making a decisive shift from the rhetoric of evil to the language of compromise .
Unless he does , President Ahmadinejad will have no trouble dividing the international community , gaining support among Muslims , rabble - rousing in Tehran , and avoiding the hard choices that we ought to be forcing on him .
To regard him as nuts is to underrate him ; to regard him as evil is to inflate his importance .
The best way to isolate him is to expose him for what he is , a leader acting against Iran 's interests ."
2006-10-11,"The craze for blogging in Iran has reached an unlikely set of adherents - the country 's conservative Islamic clerics .
Following the example of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , ayatollahs , seminary students and theologians are receiving training in setting up their own weblogs .
Courses run by the newly - established office of religious weblog expansion have begun in the holy city of Qom , the traditional home of Iran 's religious establishment .
Students more used to poring over the theological nuances of the Qur'an will receive instruction on practical matters such as blog content and technical support .
Some 300 clerics , religious students and writers have been signed up .
The arrival of the religious ruling class on Iran 's blogosphere is ironic in view of the harsh crackdown launched by the authorities against bloggers who have used it to voice political dissent .
Scores of bloggers have been jailed in recent years while many sites have been blocked using US - made filtering technology .
Iran is estimated to have between 75,000 and 100,000 bloggers , most of them avoiding politics to concentrate on matters like social affairs , culture and sex .
The trend began among the political reformist movement in 2001 as a response to the closures of dozens of liberal newspapers and magazines on the orders of religious hardliners .
It has since become a phenomenon among the computer - savvy younger generation .
Mr Ahmadinejad jumped on the bandwagon last month when he launched a blog attached to his presidential website .
His first entry set out his personal background and political philosophy and asked if the US and Israel were intent on starting a third world war ."
2006-10-19,"For centuries its rich aromas and ornate design have formed an integral part of Persian culture .
But now the hubble - bubble , or water pipe , is set to disappear from Iran 's traditional restaurants and tea - houses as part of a stringent anti - smoking drive by the government .
Health watchdogs are to collect the smoking devices from eating and drinking places under a sweeping purge of tobacco products signed into law by the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The move means an end here to a pastime that is popular across the Middle East but which for long has been viewed as a decadent indulgence by the Islamic authorities in Iran .
The government insists its motive is health related and has cited expert opinion stating that the hubble - bubble is potentially more dangerous than cigarettes .
Despite its benign image studies have suggested that the amount of cancer - causing agents inhaled from smoking a hubble - bubble is equivalent to that from a cigarette .
The overall effect can then be compounded by the longer time it takes to smoke the hubble - bubble .
Known locally as qalyoun , the activity of inhaling fruit or mint flavoured tobacco , heated by charcoals , through rubber or wooden tubes , is popular in provincial towns and cities , especially in the more traditionalist south .
Families and friends out on picnics commonly smoke in public parks .
That will be made illegal .
The habit is believed to have caught on in Iran during the 17th or 18th century , having originated in India .
There have been previous attempts at crackdowns .
Two years ago some establishments forbade women from smoking on the grounds it encouraged public flirting and mingling between the sexes .
However the latest ban is likely have greater force after being approved by the powerful guardian 's council , a body of clerics and judges charged with assessing the religious and moral suitability of legislation .
The government is setting up enforcement measures in a broad package that also bans smoking in all public buildings and workplaces and on public transport , and outlaws selling cigarettes to under-18s .
People found smoking at work face being docked a month 's salary .
All advertising and publicity promoting tobacco is to be outlawed .
Police will be empowered to fine offenders up to £ 30 or issue a court summons .
The government says that 50,000 Iranians die each year from tobacco related illnesses ."

2006-10-23,"Iran ’s president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has called for a baby boom to almost double the country ’s population to 120 million and enable it to threaten the west .
In remarks that have drawn criticism , he told MPs he wanted to scrap existing birth control policies which discouraged Iranian couples from having more than two children .
Women should work less and devote more time to their “ main mission ” of raising children , Mr Ahmadinejad said .
His comments amounted to an attack on official policies - sanctioned by senior Islamic clerics - aimed at limiting Iran ’s population , currently around 70 million .
The government supports a range of birth control measures , including female sterilisation , vasectomies and mandatory family planning classes for newly - weds .
Iran also has a state - owned condom factory .
However , Mr Ahmadinejad said : “ I am against saying that two children are enough .
Our country has a lot of capacity .
It has the capacity for many children to grow in it .
It even has the capacity for 120 million people .
Westerners have got problems .
Because their population growth is negative , they are worried and fear that if our population increases , we will triumph over them .
”
He said he wanted to bring in legislation reducing women ’s working hours based on how many children they had .
Women could work part - time on full - time salaries .
Critics reacted with alarm and said the president ’s call was ill - judged at a time when Iran was struggling with surging inflation and rising unemployment , unofficially estimated at around 25 % .
The reformist Etemad - e Melli newspaper warned that Iran could pay a high price for such “ ill - considered ” comments .
It wrote : “ He stresses the necessity of population growth and the triumph of Iran over western governments , ignoring the fact that what leads to such triumph is not population size but knowledge , technology , wealth , welfare and security . ”
Mr Ahmadinejad ’s call for a higher birth rate echoes a similar demand by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini after the triumph of Iran ’s Islamic revolution in 1979 .
The policy led to a population explosion but was later reversed because of the strain on the economy .
As a result , population growth dropped from an all - time high of 3.2 % in 1986 to around 1.2 % today , similar to that of the United States ."

Exiles and human rights groups want to highlight the fate of the thousands of people who were imprisoned and tortured for their political beliefs during his eight years in office , before he was replaced by the hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's supporters often attack Mr Khatami as a western stooge .
He did express regret for the 1979 takeover of the US embassy in a famous interview with CNN , tried to rein in the ayatollahs and helped resolve the dispute with Britain over The Satanic Verses .
From an opposing stance , liberal critics counter that repression ( though often carried out by state institutions he did not control ) continued alongside his reformist policies .
There were protests when he gave a lecture at Harvard and met Jimmy Carter while being boycotted by the Bush administration , as fixated with Iran as Iran is with the "" Great Satan "" .
Mr Khatami has called for the dispute over Iran 's nuclear ambitions to be resolved "" tactfully "" .
He will be the most senior Iranian figure to come to Britain since the Shah in 1972 .
That makes his visit important .
So does his role as president of the International Foundation for Dialogue amongst Civilisations .
St Andrews is right to encourage such dialogue .
But this great university will want to respect its own finest intellectual traditions by ensuring that it is an open and a critical one ."
2006-10-28,"Sacred Causes : Religion and Politics from the European Dictators to Al Qaeda by Michael Burleigh 576pp , Harper Press , £ 25
In his address to the UN General Assembly in September last year the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , welcomed the return of religion as a factor in world affairs .
The era of agnosticism was passing , he declared , and a new age was on the horizon : "" Humanity is once again joined in celebrating monotheism .
Faith will prove to be the solution of many of today 's problems . ""
As in his speech to the UN a few weeks ago , Ahmadinejad was mainly interested in defending his nuclear programme , which he insisted has no military purpose - a claim it would be unwise to take seriously .
His remarks on the resurgence of religion are more interesting , and point to a development that has taken liberal opinion by surprise .
For generations , progressive thinkers looked forward to a secular future .
Convinced that religious belief is a by - product of ignorance , they assumed that as science advanced faith would become a harmless private eccentricity or disappear altogether .
The actual course of events has been different .
Scientific knowledge is growing faster than at any time in history .
But fundamentalism is on the march throughout much of the world , while the mass political movements of the 20th century have crumbled .
Aside from a few evangelical atheists , no one imagines religion is going to fade away .
The secular era lies in the past .
In fact religion never really went away .
The secular ideologies that had such power during the last century were deeply shaped by Christianity .
In Earthly Powers : Religion and Politics in Europe from the French Revolution to the Great War ( 2005 ) , Michael Burleigh argued that , from the Jacobins in the French Revolution to the anarchists of late 19th - century Russia , Europe produced a succession of political religions that had many of the features of the faith they aimed to replace .
In imagining a perfected world at the end of history , Marx and Bakunin reproduced Christian eschatology : the belief that human life can be transformed in a vast revolutionary conflagration was apocalyptic myth rendered into secular terms .
Christian concepts and values permeated many lesser - known ideologies such as positivism and the many varieties of utopianism .
Sacred Causes takes the story of political religion from the interwar period to the present .
Ranging widely over the rise and fall of communism , the role of the church in National Socialist Germany and fascist Italy , Spain and Portugal , sectarian conflict in northern Ireland and the rise of radical Islam , Burleigh provides an overview of the continuing centrality of religion in European politics that is at turns informative and provocative , idiosyncratic and wildly unbalanced .
Sacred Causes is most useful where it uncovers the hidden roots of 20th - century totalitarianism .
In The Third Reich : A New History ( 2000 ) , Burleigh showed that Nazism could not be understood simply as a reaction to the social and economic dislocations of interwar Germany .
In a horrible way Nazism was a messianic movement , which offered the promise of a new life in a transfigured world to those who were allowed to survive the cataclysm that was to come .
In Sacred Causes Burleigh argues that Nazism and Leninism belong in the same stable - both were totalitarian political religions .
This will infuriate the large numbers of social scientists who mistrust theories of totalitarianism and reject the very idea of political religion , but in my view Burleigh is right on both counts .
Totalitarianism was real enough - just ask anyone who lived through it - and at its height it undoubtedly had many of the functions of religion .
Disputing these facts only shows how far social science has strayed from human experience .
Where Burleigh goes badly wrong is in implicitly contrasting the violence of 20th - century political religion with Christianity .
Reading Sacred Causes one might easily think that all the horrors of 20th - century Europe could have been avoided if only it had retained its traditional Christian faith .
A large part of the book is a laboured defence of the Vatican against charges of complicity with Nazism , and while Burleigh writes that he has "" tried to treat Pius XII in an historical way "" , it is impossible to read the result as anything other than special pleading .
Much emphasis is given to cases in which the church intervened on behalf of Jews .
Almost nothing is said about the venerable tradition of Christian anti - semitism , leaving the reader with the impression that it was an aberration from the true faith .
In fact , Jews were persecuted from the time of Constantine 's conversion to Christianity and throughout the middle ages , and in the 20th century they were targets of clerical fascism in much of Europe .
It may be true that the Vatican can not be held responsible for massacres perpetrated by the pro - Nazi Catholic Ustashe regime in wartime Yugoslavia , whose minister of education and culture , in a statement cited by Burleigh , declared : "" As for minorities such as the Serbs , Jews and Gypsies , we have three million bullets . ""
But genocide and mass murder took place in mid-20th - century Europe against a background of centuries of persecution in which the church was an active accomplice .
Passing over this history is disingenuous .
Downplaying the role of the church in the crimes of the last century is part of a larger default in Burleigh 's analysis .
Medieval Christendom was hardly an oasis of peace .
It was racked with savage wars and campaigns of systematic extermination that prefigure those of modern times .
The crusade against the Cathars launched by Pope Innocent III at the start of the 13th century led to the deaths of around half a million people , many by mass hanging , drowning or torture .
Violent millenarian movements repeatedly convulsed late - medieval and early - modern Europe .
In the early 16th century , a communist New Jerusalem was established in the city of Munster in northwest Germany that had many of the features of later secular regimes , including the methodical use of terror .
The extraordinary savagery of modern political religion does not come from giving up Christianity .
It is a secular version of the faith - based violence that has been an integral part of Christianity throughout its history .
Burleigh is at his most unbalanced when discussing Islam .
Much of his analysis is presented in a graffiti - like style that makes the tabloids look effete and precious .
A photograph of the World Trade Center in flames is captioned with the statement "" This act of mass murder announced the onset of unlimited Islamist aggression against western civilisation "" , and there is much demotic rant against multiculturalism and what Burleigh describes as "" the grim prospect of ' Eurabia ' "" .
In this atmosphere of feverish emotion , facts tend to get lost and longer historical perspectives forgotten .
Like Christianity , Islam has a powerful apocalyptic tradition that can easily turn to violence .
But there is nothing peculiarly Islamic about suicide bombing , which was first developed by the Tamil Tigers - a Marxist - Leninist party that until the war in Iraq had committed more suicide bombings than any other group .
Oddly , though it supports his overall analysis of modern political religion , Burleigh omits to mention this fact .
In much the same way he fails to note how the west nurtured Islamist movements and regimes when they could be used as proxies in the cold war and the conflicts that followed .
Reading Burleigh , one would not suspect that during the mid-90s the Taliban regime in Afghanistan enjoyed amicable relations with the US , which viewed it as pro - western and a valuable ally against Iran .
Burleigh gets one thing right .
Religion - especially of the monotheistic variety that demands universal acceptance - is back .
If ever politics was secular , it is so no longer .
Presidents whose view of the world is formed from apocalyptic myths are in charge in Iran and the US , and seem ready to act on the belief that salvation comes to humankind by way of Armageddon .
The social science that assumed religion must eventually yield to science is obsolete .
If you want to understand the beliefs that are shaping global politics , read the Book of Revelation . ·
John Gray 's Al Qaeda and What It Means to Be Modern is published by Faber"
2006-11-03,"America is now seen as a threat to world peace by its closest neighbours and allies , according to an international survey of public opinion published today that reveals just how far the country 's reputation has fallen among former supporters since the invasion of Iraq .
Carried out as US voters prepare to go to the polls next week in an election dominated by the war , the research also shows that British voters see George Bush as a greater danger to world peace than either the North Korean leader , Kim Jong - il , or the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Both countries were once cited by the US president as part of an "" axis of evil "" , but it is Mr Bush who now alarms voters in countries with traditionally strong links to the US .
The survey has been carried out by the Guardian in Britain and leading newspapers in Israel ( Haaretz ) , Canada ( La Presse and Toronto Star ) and Mexico ( Reforma ) , using professional local opinion polling in each country .
It exposes high levels of distrust .
In Britain , 69 % of those questioned say they believe US policy has made the world less safe since 2001 , with only 7 % thinking action in Iraq and Afghanistan has increased global security .
The finding is mirrored in America 's immediate northern and southern neighbours , Canada and Mexico , with 62 % of Canadians and 57 % of Mexicans saying the world has become more dangerous because of US policy .
Even in Israel , which has long looked to America to guarantee national security , support for the US has slipped .
Only one in four Israeli voters say that Mr Bush has made the world safer , outweighed by the number who think he has added to the risk of international conflict , 36 % to 25 % .
A further 30 % say that at best he has made no difference .
Voters in three of the four countries surveyed also overwhelmingly reject the decision to invade Iraq , with only Israeli voters in favour , 59 % to 34 % against .
Opinion against the war has hardened strongly since a similar survey before the US presidential election in 2004 .
In Britain 71 % of voters now say the invasion was unjustified , a view shared by 89 % of Mexicans and 73 % of Canadians .
Canada is a Nato member whose troops are in action in Afghanistan .
Neither do voters think America has helped advance democracy in developing countries , one of the justifications for deposing Saddam Hussein .
Only 11 % of Britons and 28 % of Israelis think that has happened .
As a result , Mr Bush is ranked with some of his bitterest enemies as a cause of global anxiety .
He is outranked by Osama bin Laden in all four countries , but runs the al - Qaida leader close in the eyes of UK voters : 87 % think the al - Qaida leader is a great or moderate danger to peace , compared with 75 % who think this of Mr Bush .
The US leader and close ally of Tony Blair is seen in Britain as a more dangerous man than the president of Iran ( 62 % think he is a danger ) , the North Korean leader ( 69 % ) and the leader of Hizbullah , Hassan Nasrallah ( 65 % ) .
Only 10 % of British voters think that Mr Bush poses no danger at all .
Israeli voters remain much more trusting of him , with 23 % thinking he represents a serious danger and 61 % thinking he does not .
Contrary to the usual expectation , older voters in Britain are slightly more hostile to the Iraq war than younger ones .
Voters under 35 are also more trusting of Mr Bush , with hostility strongest among people aged 35 - 65 .

2006-11-17,"Dozens of literary masterpieces and international bestsellers have been banned in Iran in a dramatic rise in censorship that has plunged the country 's publishing industry into crisis .
Companies that once specialised in popular fiction and other money - spinners are being restricted to academic texts under a cultural freeze instigated by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Several thousand new and previously published works have been blacklisted by Iran 's culture and Islamic guidance ministry , which vets all books .
Newly banned books include Farsi translations of Tracy Chevalier 's best - seller Girl With a Pearl Earring and Dan Brown 's The Da Vinci Code , the latter for upsetting clerics within Iran 's tiny Christian community .
Chevalier 's novel has completed six print runs in Iran and earned hefty profits for its local publisher , Cheshme .
Another publishing house has been banned from selling a successful series of books featuring lyrics by the Beatles , the Rolling Stones , the Doors , Black Sabbath , Queen and Guns n ' Roses .
Stores were told to remove the books or face closure .
Permission was subsequently denied for the publisher to reprint .
The crackdown also covers classics , such as William Faulkner 's As I Lay Dying , and scores of works by Iranian authors .
Publication rights have been withdrawn for The Cock , a novel by Ebrahim Golestan , an Iranian writer based in Britain , and for all works by Sadegh Hedayat , a pre - revolutionary novelist and commentator whose books are renowned in several European countries .
Some Iranian writers have vowed to withhold future books for publication .
Some bans are being imposed under fresh rules requiring renewed permits for previously published works .
Crisis talks between Iran 's publishing union and the culture ministry have failed to ease the situation .
"" We have books on psychology , history , politics and folklore which have been sitting for nine months and still no answer , "" a senior executive with Cheshme told the Guardian .
The clampdown has been headed by the hardline culture minister , Mohammed Hossein Saffar Harandi , a former revolutionary guard and close ally of Mr Ahmadinejad .
It follows a relative thaw during the eight - year presidency of Mr Ahmadinejad 's reformist predecessor , Mohammed Khatami .
One publisher said yesterday : "" Culture ministry officials told us that during the reformist period the government went to excess and permitted books which ruined the atmosphere . ""
Opening Iran 's national book week festival this week , Mr Saffar Harandi said a tougher line was needed to stop publishers from serving a "" poisoned dish to the young generation "" .
He said some books deliberately gave Iranians a sense of inferiority and encouraged them to be lackeys of the west .
"" We have complaints against those who see books as only a market and are acting as assistants for evil , "" he said .
"" Sometimes the humiliation of Iranian youth is implied or suggested in the books .
Sometimes the media transmits the concept that we Muslims and easterners lack proper means and , therefore , we should stretch our hands towards others . ""
His comments followed the publication of a parliamentary report that attacked Mr Khatami 's presidency for creating what it said was a climate encouraging immoral behaviour , sex before marriage , mockery of religious traditions and secularism .
One of the report 's authors , Javad Aryianmanesh , vice - chairman of the parliamentary culture committeea said : "" Due to cultural indulgence necessary supervision over artistic and cultural works did not take place . ""
However , publishers say many books are being banned arbitrarily .
"" We had adapted to the previous policy but now that is annulled and they are imposing their own personal taste , "" said Mohammed Ali Jafarieh , head of the Sales publishing house .
"" Publishers are being hurt .
We rely on multiple print runs to make a profit but if these are being denied we can not make any money . ""
The rise in book censorship mirrors repression in other spheres .
In September the reformist newspaper Shargh was closed after publishing a cartoon depicting President George Bush , disguised as a horse , debating with a donkey under a halo , widely seen as representing Mr Ahmadinejad .
The publishers launched a replacement newspaper , Rouzegar , but it was ordered to close after five days ."
2006-11-21,"President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran has invited his Iraqi and Syrian counterparts to an unprecedented three - way summit in Tehran this weekend to discuss the crisis in Iraq .
The meeting is designed in part to promote his role as a responsible regional player rather than the rogue maverick he is often portrayed as in the west .
It will also help to boost Bashar al - Assad of Syria , who had poor relations with Iraq 's president , Jalal Talabani , until recently .
The announcement of the summit came as Syria 's foreign minister , Walid Moallem , ended the first high - level visit to Baghdad since the US - led invasion in April 2003 .
Both sides have talked of restoring diplomatic relations , which were broken in 1982 when Damascus sided with Tehran after Iraq attacked Iran .
Syria 's security was intimately linked to Iraq 's , Mr Moallem said in Baghdad on Sunday .
The weekend summit was confirmed by Khaled Salih , the spokesman of the Kurdish regional government in Irbil . ""
President Talabani will attend the meeting , which will be the first trilateral summit of its kind , "" he told the Guardian last night .
Mr Talabani is a Kurd who also heads the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan , one of the two main parties in the autonomous Kurdish part of Iraq .
Iran already has close relations with the Iraqi government .
Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki 's Dawa party , as well as the largest Iraqi Shia party , the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , were based in Iran in exile during the Saddam Hussein era .
US officials have repeatedly accused Syria of allowing former Ba'athist insurgents as well as al - Qaida sympathisers to pass into Iraq from Syria .
The Iraqi Ba'athists are said to have training camps in Syria - a charge that Syria denies .
It says it can not control its long , largely desert border with Iraq but has improved security patrols in response to US requests .
"" We do n't know how much they [ Syria ] are assisting this effort , but we do n't know how much they are trying to preclude it either , "" a US military spokesman , Major General William Caldwell , said in Baghdad yesterday "" We still see foreign fighters , between 70 and 100 a month , coming across the Syrian border into Iraq , "" he said , figures that are similar to those of last year .
He said US and Iraqi soldiers had killed 425 foreign fighters so far this year and captured 670 .
Twenty percent of them were Syrian , a similar percentage Egyptian , and most of the rest were from Sudan and Saudi Arabia .
The fighters move to the province of Anbar , where US forces have been taking constant casualties , as well as to Mosul and its governorate , where bombings and assassinations are frequent .
Iraqi officials in Mosul have called on Syria to rein in the insurgents and expel them . ""
If Syria really wants good relations and to open a new page with Iraq , it could make a big difference , "" said Khasro Goran , Mosul 's deputy governor .
He referred to Syria 's clampdown a few years ago on the extreme Kurdish group , the PKK , which led to the capture of Abdullah Ocalan , its leader . ""
They gave the PKK leaders 24 hours to leave Syria and they did , "" he said .
"" I ca n't say the terrorism will be defeated .
But it 'll be reduced by 50 % .
"" The three - way summit this weekend would be an important forerunner for a wider meeting of Iraq and all its neighbours which the independent study group under James Baker is expected to propose when it produces its report for President George Bush shortly .
Inside the US administration the vice - president , Dick Cheney , is widely reported to be against any accommodation with Iran , and is still pressing for military action if Tehran refuses to give up its nuclear ambitions .
However , he is facing isolation after it was announced that Donald Rumsfeld , his principal ally , would be replaced at the Pentagon by Robert Gates , a former CIA official who has argued for talks with Iran .
According to the New Yorker magazine , Mr Cheney 's position has been further weakened by a CIA analysis that cast doubt on White House assumptions on how long it would take Iran to build a nuclear bomb .
Sensors placed by US and Israeli agents near suspected nuclear sites had not picked up significant radioactivity , the report said , and there was little other hard evidence that a secret nuclear weapons programme was under way . ""
The intelligence community assessment is that they are engaged in a nuclear weapons programme , but there is not enough intelligence to prove it , or to say what its current status is , "" said Vincent Cannistraro , a former head of CIA counter - terrorist operations .
"" The CIA is just being very cautious .
And that is what the ideologues do n't like .
It 's the same old story , but the intelligence analysts are pushing back , unlike in 2002 . """
2006-11-23,"An Iranian actor at the centre of a video sex scandal has spoken for the first time publicly to deny being a collaborator in the now notorious home - made film .
Zahra Amir Ebrahimi , one of Iran 's best known television performers , is facing social ostracism , a wrecked career and a possible lashing after police seized copies of the footage , which appears to show her having sex .
The film , which has been distributed in street markets and posted on websites , has caused profound shock at a time when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's Islamist government is trying to banish the "" corrupting "" effects of western culture .
It has been given added impact by Ebrahimi 's reputation for playing religious , morally upstanding characters in Iranian state TV soaps .
One highly successful series , Narges , was watched by an estimated 68 % of the population .
Police interrogated Ebrahimi at length after being alerted to the film 's existence .
She has not been charged but investigations are continuing .
However , in an exclusive interview with the Guardian , Ebrahimi , 25 , denied being the woman in the film .
She dismissed it as a fake made by a vengeful former fiance who used studio techniques to form a montage of incriminating images designed to destroy her career .
"" I watched the film after I heard about the fuss from colleagues and the girl in it is not me , "" Ebrahimi said .
"" I admit there are some similarities to the character I played in Narges .
It is possible to use studio make - up to have a person look like me .
I have some knowledge of montage techniques
and I know you can create a new face by distorting the features of another person .
"" Legal experts say Ebrahimi 's denial may be sufficient to avoid punishment .
Under Iranian law , video footage must be corroborated by supporting evidence or a confession .
According to the legal code , sex between two unmarried people carries punishment of up to 99 lashes .
Ebrahimi 's ex - fiance , an assistant film producer who has been referred to publicly only as Mr X , is in custody after being extradited from Armenia .
He faces up to three years in jail and a £ 6,000 fine if found guilty of making and distributing the film , which contravenes Iran 's strict indecency laws .
He admits taking part but claims that Ebrahimi suggested the film , which he says was shot in her home , and then distributed it herself .
However , in a 45-minute interview , Ebrahimi - wearing a hijab and a long woollen coat - said her former fiance threatened revenge after she ended their relationship a year ago because of his infidelity . ""
He had a lot of affairs and our relationship ended in a very immoral way , "" she said .
"" He said he would do something that would mean I would be unable to hold my head up and would prevent me ever working again in Iran .
I think this film is him trying to put his threats into action . ""
An estimated 100,000 copies have been circulating in the last two months .
The accompanying publicity has prompted some parents to voice concern that their children have asked to see the film , which has been dubbed Narges II .
Private films showing sex scenes are not uncommon in Iran .
However , Ebrahimi 's high profile and the ongoing cultural clean - up campaign have prompted a sensitive reaction from the authorities .
Tehran 's chief prosecutor , Saeed Mortazavi , has ordered police to conduct a special investigation and wants death sentences for those convicted of circulating such productions .
Ebrahimi acknowledged that she had been emotionally upset but denied reports that the affair had driven her to attempt suicide .
Her acting career is in jeopardy amid reports that her employers are considering dropping her .
But Ebrahimi , who comes from a religious family , said the heaviest burden came from being accused of immorality in a religious society . ""
According to the moral norms of Iranian society , it is very damaging for this film to be distributed under my name , "" she said .
"" If you look at my professional resume , you will see that I have taken part in mainly spiritual or religious films and programmes . ""
My parents and I thought we were living in a society with common sense .
Instead , we find that 90 % of people are following this thing and taking it seriously .
If people have a chance , they are curious about indecent and vulgar things . """
2006-11-29,"Perhaps understandably , the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , is feeling misunderstood by the American people .
His response ?
Write them a letter .
Generally castigated by the US media - when referred to at all - as the leader of an unstable would - be nuclear power who wants Israel wiped off the map , Mr Ahmadinejad seems to think a direct approach is needed .
According to today 's front page of the state - run newspaper Iran , the president has written a "" five - page letter to the American people "" , to be released by Iran 's representative at the United Nations later in the day .
The contents are not yet known .
However , it 's a fair bet that whatever Mr Ahmadinejad 's many other interests - he has a PhD in traffic and transport management for starters - the letter will be some sort of a plea for understanding .
In May , Mr Ahmadinejad sent an 18-page letter to George Bush , the first official communication between the two countries ' presidents since Iran 's Islamic Revolution of 1979 .
As official statements go , it was more chin - stroking philosophical debate than Alastair Campbell - style sound bite , beginning :
For some time now I have been thinking how one can justify the undeniable contradictions that exist in the international arena .
But beneath the rhetoric was severe criticism of US policy in Iraq , the Palestinian territories and elsewhere .
Washington , somewhat unimpressed , criticised the missive for not addressing Iran 's nuclear programme , something it has stressed must be dealt with before the nations can hold direct talks .
Perhaps Iraq could help heal the long rift .
The Iraq Study Group , which reports in December , could recommend that Washington seek Tehran 's support in trying to bring stability to Iraq .
In the meantime , Mr Ahmadinejad feels a direct appeal to the American people over the heads of their government might improve understanding .
It is a bold move , although one worryingly reminiscent of the sort of newspaper advertisements taken out by the over - rich and over - famous when they feel they have been misrepresented .
Perhaps the most famous example is the full page ad taken out in The Times in 1995 by Richard Gere and Cindy Crawford to announce that , contrary to scurrilous rumour , they were "" heterosexual and monogamous and take our commitment to each other very seriously "" .
They separated six months later .
In the face of his even more mixed popular image , what could Mr Ahmadinejad possibly say to win over America ?"
2006-12-05,"President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran , who flaunts his ideological fervour , has been accused of undermining Iran 's Islamic revolution after television footage appeared to show him watching a female song and dance show .
The famously austere Mr Ahmadinejad has been criticised by his own allies after attending the lavish opening ceremony of the Asian games in Qatar , a sporting competition involving 13,000 athletes from 39 countries .
The ceremony featured Indian and Egyptian dancers and female vocalists .
Many were not wearing veils .
Women are forbidden to sing and dance before a male audience under Iran 's Islamic legal code .
Officials are expected to excuse themselves from such engagements when abroad but TV pictures showed Mr Ahmadinejad sitting with President Bashar Assad of Syria and Ismail Haniya , the Palestinian prime minister , during last Friday 's ceremony in Doha .
Religious fundamentalists , usually Mr Ahmadinejad 's keenest supporters , are asking why he attended a ceremony that violated his own government 's strict interpretation of Shia Islam .
The Baztab website , considered close to Mohsen Rezaee , a former revolutionary guard commander with links to powerful sections of Iran 's political hierarchy , said Mr Ahmadinejad 's presence had offended Shias in Iran and elsewhere .
"" The failure of Ahmadinejad to object and his constant presence has damaged the image of Iran 's Islamic revolution and its commitment to Islamic rules in contrast with the Arab countries in the Gulf , "" it said .
The president 's aides insist he was not present during the singing and dancing .
His press secretary , Ali Akbar Javanfekr , claimed Mr Ahmadinejad had left for Doha airport before the performance .
However , Baztab posted footage which purported to show Mr Ahmadinejad in his seat after the show .
Jalal Yahyazadeh , a rightwing MP , said : "" We have heard from some sources that Ahmadinejad was in the stadium at the time .
Those who created the conditions for his presence should be investigated as quickly as possible . """
2006-12-06,"Iran announced yesterday details of a conference questioning whether the Holocaust really happened , prompted by an international outcry a year ago when President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad described the slaughter of six million Jews by the Nazis as "" myth "" fabricated to justify Israel .
The foreign ministry said "" intellectuals and researchers "" from 30 countries - including Britain - would attend Studying the Holocaust : An international view , in Tehran on Monday and Tuesday .
The idea for the gathering was dismissed earlier this year as "" shocking , ridiculous and stupid "" by Tony Blair .
Iran responded by inviting him to attend .
A Foreign Office spokesman said it had no record of who was going .
"" I think the government 's views on Iran 's comments regarding the Holocaust are well known but it is not up to us who travels to Iran . ""
Participants will consider documentary , pictorial , physical and demographic evidence in what Iranian officials depict as an academic investigation to establish the Holocaust 's authenticity and whether the reported number of victims was exaggerated .
Organisers say it will include submissions for and against .
It will also focus on the plight of the Palestinians .
The conference will have six panel discussions and an open forum .
It will discuss the capacity of Nazi death camps and the impact of the second world war on other national and ethnic groups .
Iranian officials say Jewish suffering is played up at the expense of other victims .
Manouchehr Mohammadi , the foreign ministry 's research and education officer , said the conference was intended as a platform for open discussion of the Holocaust , which Iran claims is denied in the west .
"" Our aim is to scientifically study the Holocaust and listen to both sides before reaching a conclusion , "" Mr Mohammadi said .
"" This issue has a crucial role regarding the west 's policies towards the countries of the Middle East , especially the Palestinians .
Iran is n't against or for .
We were n't involved in this event so we can be a neutral judge .
It is important for us to know the answer so that we can process our stances to issues in this region .
If we conclude that the Holocaust happened , we will admit it but we are still going to ask why Palestinians have to pay . ""
He said it would not be a forum for anti - semites or neo - Nazis , and rabbis would attend .
"" Our policy does n't mean we want to defend the crimes of Hitler . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad has called for Israel to be "" wiped off the map "" and has said its inhabitants should go to Europe or Alaska .
Michael Rosen , of the Community Security Trust , which works to safeguard Jews in Britain , said he was aware of the event but that it was not clear who was planning to attend from the UK .
Karen Pollock , of the Holocaust Educational Trust , said : "" To hold a state - sponsored conference questioning the truth of the Holocaust is not only deeply disturbing but a huge insult to Holocaust survivors and the families of Holocaust victims . """
2006-12-11,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , faced an unprecedented outburst of public opposition today from student demonstrators who burned his picture and chanted "" death to the dictator "" .
In the first sign of open dissent since he took office last year , dozens of activists shouted abuse and set off firecrackers as Mr Ahmadinejad addressed students at Tehran 's Amir Kabir university .
They were voicing anger at what they say is an increasing repressiveness on Iran 's campuses under his government .
A presidential aide said 50 to 60 students took part in the protest .
The heckling prompted scuffles between the protesters and the president 's supporters , who chanted : "" Ahmadi , Ahmadi , we support you . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad , who was marking Iranian students ' day , answered the "" dictator "" taunts by saying : "" Everyone knows the real dictator is America and its servants . ""
He added : "" A few who claim there is a stifling climate are trying to stifle the majority by not letting them hear what is being said .
"" As students set fire to his picture , he said : "" Everyone should know that Ahmadinejad is prepared to be burned in the path of true freedom , independence and justice . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad - who has turned his appearances before mass audiences into a potent political tool - has insisted that the protesters should not be punished , Reuters reported , citing a presidential spokesman .
The outburst came as Iranians prepare to go to the polls on Friday for elections to local councils and the powerful assembly of experts .
It will be Mr Ahmadinejad 's first electoral test since taking office and comes as his government is under pressure over rising prices and a perceived failure to deliver on economic promises .
The protest was also the latest in a series of recent signs of unrest on Iran 's campuses , which had been largely quiet since the brutal suppression of a wave of pro - democracy demonstrations under Mr Ahmadinejad 's reformist predecessor , Mohammed Khatami .
On Sunday , an estimated 700 Amir Kabir university students protested against a clampdown that has included the closure of the Islamic students ' committee and the exclusion of former activists from courses .
They were also demonstrating against the demolition of the students ' committee building and the imposition of the university chancellor without elections .
Police restricted access to the campus as demonstrators shouted anti - government slogans .
Last week , hundreds of students at Tehran university were confronted by police as they chanted : "" We only want freedom of expression . ""
Vahid Abedini , a member of the university 's democracy seekers ' committee , told the pro - reformist Etemad newspaper that the gatherings had been organised to defend the independence of universities .
Hundreds of students with a record of political activism have been barred from academic courses while many lecturers have been forced to retire .
This year , Mr Ahmadinejad demanded a purge of "" secular and liberal "" lecturers , whom he accused of having been a fifth column for western values and colonialism for 150 years .
Under his presidency , a hardline cleric was appointed chancellor of Tehran university for the first time .
The remains of "" martyrs "" from the 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq war have been given burial ceremonies in several universities in what has been seen as a pretext for allowing pro - government vigilantes entry to keep watch on student activities ."

2006-12-12,"An international cast of established Holocaust deniers and implacable foes of Israel were given an open forum by Iran yesterday to support Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's contention that the murder of six million Jews by the Nazis was a "" myth "" .
The foreign ministry opened a two - day conference , Review of the Holocaust : Global Vision - which senior officials portrayed as scientific scholarship but which Ehud Olmert , Israel 's prime minister , denounced as a "" sick phenomenon "" .
Visiting Berlin , Mr Olmert urged Germany to sever diplomatic ties with Iran .
Iran 's foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , insisted the event was necessary to counter an alleged lack of free speech in the west about the Holocaust , which Iranian officials argue is used to justify Israel 's oppression of the Palestinians . ""
Today people who claim to be against Nazism have a record of colonialism and racism , "" he said .
"" The objective for organising this conference is to create an atmosphere to raise various opinions about a historical issue .
We are not seeking to deny or prove the Holocaust . ""
But pretensions to scholastic objectivity were undermined by the background of some among the 67 foreign visitors from 30 countries , including Britain .
They included David Duke , a former imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan ; Robert Faurisson , a French lecturer stripped of his academic tenure for his anti - Holocaust opinions ; and Michele Renouf , a London - based associate of the British author David Irving .
Irving is currently serving a jail sentence for Holocaust denial in Austria .
A group of radical anti - Zionist rabbis , Jews United Against Israel , who oppose a Jewish state on religious grounds , were given a prominent role .
Among them was Rabbi Ahron Cohen , a retired former lecturer at the Jewish religious college in Hitchin , Hertfordshire .
Rabbi Cohen acknowledged that the Holocaust had happened but said he saw nothing anti - semitic in Mr Ahmadinejad 's comments .
However , exhibitions on the conference 's fringes conveyed a different message .
A series of posters carried the words "" myth "" and "" truth "" juxtaposed .
Under "" myth "" were widely accepted verities of the Holocaust while under the "" truth "" label were opposing contentions .
One poster , simply headlined "" truth "" , carried photos of Irving and Ernst Zundel , a prominent German neo - Nazi also now in jail .
Two of Irving books , Hitler 's War and Nuremberg :
The Last Battle , were displayed along with several other Holocaust revisionist works .
There were no books by orthodox historians on the Nazi era .
A video referred to the "" supposed gas chambers "" and the "" alleged final solution "" .
A series of photos showed British soldiers "" forcing "" German prisoners to remove corpses from a mass grave .
The caption suggested that the British were responsible for the deaths , saying : "" The interesting point is that the grave was established in the last days of the war just as the camp was being opened by British soldiers . ""
Another picture , purportedly of Dachau concentration camp , shows a smiling , well - fed group of inmates .
Few visitors were apologetic .
Mr Duke praised the event as an exercise in free speech .
"" It 's a shame that Iran , a country we often call oppressive , has to give this opportunity for free speech , "" he said .
"" I think Israel is a terrorist state .
It is the number one terrorist state in the world . ""
Ms Renouf said "" terrible things "" had happened to the Jews during the second world war but claimed their own leaders had brought it upon them . ""
If people become anti - semitic , it 's because they believe the leaders of the Jews and are reacting to the anti - gentile nature of Judaism , "" she said .
Moshe Ayre Friedman , an Austrian rabbi , argued that the figure of six million Jewish dead had come from a prophecy by Theodore Herzl , founder of modern Zionism , long before the second world war .
He said recent research suggested the true figure was about one million . ""
Politically and historically , the land of Palestine does n't belong to the Jews and should be returned to Palestinians , "" he said .
But Moris Motamed , Iran 's sole Jewish MP , labelled the gathering a "" huge insult "" .
In Britain , Stephen Smith , chairman of the Holocaust memorial day trust , said the conference contrasted with a high awareness of the Holocaust among young Britons .
"" Three - quarters of young people know when the Holocaust took place and 84 % have heard of Auschwitz .
Knowledge is the first step to prevention .
Denial is the first step to repetition , "" he said ."
2006-12-13,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad himself was the power behind the Tehran conference on the Holocaust that has rightly been giving the Islamic Republic such negative media exposure in the west .
Iran 's hardline president billed this odious event as intended to allow scholars to "" debate "" the extermination of Europe 's Jews free from the taboos and intimidation they allegedly suffer in their own societies .
No surprise then that luminaries such as David Duke , formerly of the Ku Klux Klan , a racist associate of the jailed David Irving and a brace of other seedy anti - semites with dubious or non - existent academic credentials flocked to the Iranian capital to take part .
German neo - Nazis were banned from attending by their government .
The president was being heckled by students protesting his other madcap views when it began on Monday , but he welcomed the guests yesterday .
This official stamp matters because Mr Ahmadinejad claims to have arranged the conference to retaliate for the notorious Danish cartoons poking fun at the Prophet Muhammad .
These were seen as offensive by many Muslims but they were not the work of any government .
The president 's misunderstanding of how western democracies function may be matched by western misunderstanding of Iran or Islam .
But it is hard to imagine anything remotely analogous to his questioning - in the face of overwhelming historical evidence - of the industrial - scale murder of 6 million Jews during the second world war .
The word "" myth "" was much in evidence in Tehran .
It is unclear whether he believes that gays , Gypsies and other victims of Nazi persecution also shamelessly lied about their suffering .
This unpleasant episode is more about the present than the past .
Iran is deeply hostile to Israel .
Mr Ahmadinejad has spoken of it "" vanishing from the page of time "" - prompting heated debate , more political than philological ( and often absurdly indulgent of this bitter foe of the US ) , as to precisely what he meant .
Iran 's determined quest for nuclear power is widely seen as a cover for the acquisition of nuclear weapons to challenge Israel 's nuclear supremacy .
There are some very grave dangers here .
It is legitimate to question the tenets of Zionism and fair to see Palestinians as its victims .
Suggesting that Auschwitz was a "" big lie "" concocted to serve Jewish interests is not .
It is fair too to criticise Israel 's policies .
Plenty of Jews do , and want it to do more to make peace with the Arabs , though Iran 's support for Hamas in Palestine and Hizbullah in Lebanon makes that even harder to do .
Mr Ahmedinejad 's repulsive promotion of Holocaust denial is unworthy of his own country , insulting to Jews and damaging to the Palestinians he claims to care about ."
2006-12-13,"The outgoing US ambassador to the United Nations , John Bolton , is backing a call for the president of Iran to be charged with inciting genocide because of his speeches advocating the destruction of the state of Israel .
Barely a week after he announced his resignation from the UN post , Mr Bolton will appear tomorrow among a panel of diplomats and lawyers calling for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to be prosecuted .
The panel has been convened by a Jewish umbrella group in the US , the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organisations .
Mr Bolton was forced to quit his post after his appointment was blocked by Democrats and several Republicans in the Senate foreign relations committee .
President George Bush said he accepted the resignation but was unhappy about it .
The call for legal action came as Mr Ahmadinejad repeated his onslaught against Israel at an international gathering of holocaust deniers in Tehran .
The president , who has dismissed the murder of six million Jews by the Nazis as a myth told up to 70 visiting speakers that the Israeli state would soon be wiped out . ""
Thanks to people 's wishes and God 's will , the trend for the existence of the Zionist regime is downwards and this is what God has promised and what all nations want , "" he said .
He was praised by several participants for his "" bravery and democratic actions "" a source who was present told the Guardian .
The event came under fierce attack abroad .
At his monthly Downing Street press conference , Tony Blair condemned the conference as "" shocking beyond belief "" and singled out the decision to invite David Duke , a former leading Ku Klux Klan member , as proof of Iran 's extremism .
Meeting Israel 's prime minister , Ehud Olmert , in Berlin , the chancellor , Angela Merkel , said Germany rejected the conference and would "" act against it with all the means that we have "" .
Franco Frattini , the EU 's justice commissioner , denounced it as "" an affront to the whole democratic world "" .
By contrast , Mr Duke praised the event as "" a tremendous step forward "" and said Mr Ahmadinejad said "" sensible things "" .
Mr Bolton will be joined in tomorrow 's launch of the legal action against Mr Ahmadinejad by a Harvard law professor , Alan Dershowitz , and the former Israeli ambassador to the UN , Dore Gold , together with experts from the US , Canada and Israel .
A suit will be lodged with the international court of justice at The Hague , which will decide whether to hear the action .
The panel said the Iranian president was guilty of inciting genocide "" by making numerous threats against the United States , calling for the destruction of Israel and instigating discrimination against Christians and Jews "" .
His words violate a 1948 UN genocide convention , to which Iran is a signatory , they said ."
2006-12-13,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , defends his country 's right to develop its nuclear capacity ( though denying that his country seeks nuclear weapons ) and challenges decades of Holocaust research with equal fervour .
How should Ahmadinejad 's denial that Iran intends to pursue nuclear arms be judged in light of his Holocaust denial ?
Journalists ask , but Ahmadinejad wo n't answer .
His argument is that Iran does not want nuclear weapons , and would not use them to duplicate a crime that did not happen .
Some westerners , while lamenting Ahmadinejad 's insensitivity , have struggled to minimise the significance of his Holocaust denial as the fulminations of a misguided fanatic ( as if misguided fanaticism were an incidental quality in a nation 's president ) .
This misses the point .
Holocaust denial is not an argument about the past .
It is an argument about the future .
The point of Holocaust denial is to remove the taboo now associated with the original crime .
For deniers , the problem is not that the Holocaust occurred , but that most people still consider it to be a bad thing .
Thus , Auschwitz is dismissed as a "" detail of history "" , in the telling phrase of the French politician Jean - Marie Le Pen .
What Holocaust deniers seek most is to undo the idea that Nazi crimes should have any impact on current international relations or on global notions of morality .
Ahmadinejad made this point repeatedly in interviews with western media and in long letters to US president George W Bush and German chancellor Angela Merkel .
He has even done the math :
60 years have indeed passed since the Holocaust ended , five times the actual period of Nazi rule in Germany .
So , it is time , he wrote Merkel , to "" make the shadow of World War II disappear "" .
Unsurprisingly , he has Israel in mind .
But Ahmadinejad 's obsession with Israel blinds him to any understanding of what actually happened across Europe during WWII - and to the fact that present - day Europe was constructed over the six decades since then as a response to that historical disaster .
In writing to Merkel , he is addressing the leader of a country decimated by Nazi rule - millions dead , an entire society and economy reduced to rubble .
Had she been politically active during the Nazi times , Merkel would have landed in a concentration camp .
Yet Ahmadinejad , referring to Europe 's response to the Holocaust , asks her to imagine "" what standing some European countries could have had and what global role they could have played , if it had not been for this 60-year - old imposition "" .
Germany does not seem to have done too badly in these 60 years , but consider the core of this "" imposition "" : the effort to give enduring political expression to the moral concepts of good and evil that the Nazis tried to invert .
As a policy , the Holocaust was premised on denial - the physical denial of any legitimate religious , racial , or political difference within Nazi Germany .
The means of this denial were the annihilation of offending populations - the Jews foremost among them - in a merciless attempt at social purification .
The intent of the crime was so ambitious , and its scope so great , that a new word - genocide - was coined to describe it .
Modern media played a role , too , broadcasting images of the death camps that immediately came to symbolise the depth of Nazi depravity .
The enduring impact of the Holocaust , explored in hundreds of books and films , was to portray Nazism as the ultimate expression of evil .
In this context , to deny the Holocaust is to reject its modern association with evil , and imply that what happened during the Holocaust could be accommodated under a different moral order .
Ahmadinejad argues that outside pressure , not the actual historical experience of total war , keeps the memory of the Holocaust alive in Europe .
What he does n't understand is that the memory of Auschwitz is also the memory of the Battle of Britain , the bombing of Dresden , the occupation of Paris , and the Warsaw uprising .
Auschwitz did not occur in a vacuum .
It was the furthest extreme of a disaster that incorporated all these other events .
If the Holocaust did not happen , or if it has no meaning , then how is the rest of modern European history to be understood ?
If there were no crimes , then the Nazis were not criminals .
Ahmadinejad feels the power that comes with re - writing history .
He enjoys taunting the West with the past that he denies .
He understands the temptation of evil , the lure of forgetfulness .
Above all , he is a practical man .
It does Ahmadinejad no good for Europe to maintain a sense of history that must put it at cross - purposes with Iran .
Ahmadinejad 's purpose is simple ; find the weak spots in the chain that links Europe to its past and , through this past , to Israel and the US .
Europe 's choice is equally clear ; to accept absolution for this past from the president of Iran , or to determine whether the standard of truth that he applies to history is the same as he applies to nuclear weapons .

2006-12-15,"Iranian voters went to the polls today to elect local councils and a powerful clerical body in the first test of president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's popularity since he took office .
In the most direct challenge to his authority , an unlikely alliance of liberal reformers and traditional conservatives will seek to thwart Mr Ahmadinejad 's ambitions of winning control of Tehran city council , the country 's flagship local authority , and unseating its mayor .
A reformist coalition that includes former cabinet ministers and a reigning Olympic Taekwon Do champion is hoping to use the 15-member council as a springboard to an electoral comeback after a succession of setbacks that has left Iran 's leading liberal political movement marginalised .
They have made unofficial common cause with a rightwing group , the grand fundamentalist coalition , in the hope of stopping Mr Ahmadinejad 's radical supporters from gaining control of the authority .
At issue is the status of city 's mayor , Mohammed Baqer Qalibaf .
A former national chief of police and fellow hardliner , Mr Qalibaf is seen by Mr Ahmadinejad as a potential presidential rival .
The pair have clashed over several issues , including plans to extend Tehran 's underground rail network .
A pro - Ahmadinejad coalition , the oddly named Good Scent of Service , wants to take over the council so it can install a new mayor .
Analysts say the coalition - headed by Mehrdad Bazrpash , a former head of the Basij militia , and including the president 's sister , Parvin - would replace Mr Qalibaf with Sadegh Mahsooli , currently Mr Ahmadinejad 's chief adviser .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's opponents hope to exploit simmering economic discontent - notably over rising prices and high unemployment - together with fears over increasing restrictions on personal freedoms .
Experts say the outcome hinges on turnout .
Only 12 % of Tehran voters took part in the last elections in 2003 , when reformers were routed by hardliners .
That led to Mr Ahmadinejad becoming mayor , a position that he used as a platform to launch his successful presidential bid .
This time , reformers are urging voters to turn out by arguing that a low poll would help Mr Ahmadinejad .
An opinion survey published by ISPA , a student polling agency , predicted that around 62 % of Tehran electors would vote .
Mashaallah Shamsolvaezin , a leading reformist and spokesman for the committee for defending press freedom , said a voter boycott would be tantamount to political suicide for reformers and liberal - minded citizens .
"" If the right to vote is not practiced , a small group is going to be allowed to decide and will do whatever they like , "" he said .
The local authority elections coincide with a poll to the 86-member assembly of experts , a body of religious figures which meets twice yearly and is empowered to appoint or remove Iran 's supreme leader , the country 's most powerful political figure .
Leading candidates include Hashemi Rafsanjani , a former president and noted pragmatist , and Mohammed - Taghi Mesbah - Yazdi , an arch - fundamentalist and assumed mentor to Mr Ahmadinejad .
Dozens of pro - reformist candidates have complained of being disqualified by the powerful guardian council ."
2006-12-15,"It was almost enough to make me feel sorry for David Irving .
Imagine being stuck in your cell in Vienna , like Cinderella chained to the stove , while all your neo - Nazi and racist buddies basked in the media spotlight in Tehran at the Holocaust Denier 's Ball .
An electioneering stunt by the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who faces the voters today , the so - called "" International Conference on Review of the Holocaust "" has made headlines newspapers around the world .
The Vatican condemned it , the White House declared it an "" affront to the entire civilised world "" , and Tony Blair found the proceedings "" shocking beyond belief "" - not bad for a gathering of around 70 oddballs , barely enough to make up a decent - sized pub quiz .
The Los Angeles Times , a great metropolitan newspaper , warned that in the context of Iran 's nuclear ambitions , "" the conference illustrated a present and growing danger to the international community "" .
Hello ?
Can we please do a reality check here ?
The Holocaust is one of the most well - documented occurrences in history .
Anybody with an interest in the facts - and a strong stomach - can learn more about how the Nazis isolated , assembled and murdered millions of European Jews than most people will ever want to know .
Like every other complex historical event , aspects of what happened are continually being revised in light of new information .
And some of what most people think they know - that murdered Jews were made into bars of soap , for example - simply is n't true .
But the broad outlines - and the fine detail - given by such scholars as Raul Hilberg or Martin Gilbert have never been credibly challenged .
To deny the reality of the Holocaust , then , is not so much an argument as an insult .
Of course it is sad , and deplorable , when a head of state resorts to racist insults ( for the same reasons that make it sad , and deplorable , when Israel invites someone like Avigdor Lieberman into the government ) .
It is also sad that religious fanaticism led some Jews to serve as beards for a gathering whose only common ground was enmity to Jews .
( As my older son remarked , the technical term for such people is meshuggeneh ) .
But it would be equally crazy to see the conference as evidence of Iran 's fitness , or unfitness , to join the nuclear club - or of anything else except the intellectual poverty of the country 's rulers .
Which , sadly , has never been a bar to the development - or "" modernisation "" - of nuclear weapons .
A more sane response to such a gathering would be to ignore it - or , if the sheer novelty of the story makes it irresistible , to give it the same coverage as beer - drinking dogs , tap - dancing donkeys and other items of freakish interest .
In fact if the Iranian president decides to make this an annual event I have a suggestion : next time why not see if the Austrians will let David Irving attend as well - but only if the Iranians agree to keep him .
That 's my two cents ."
2006-12-18,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , faced electoral embarrassment today after the apparent failure of his supporters to win control of key local councils and block the political comeback of his most powerful opponent .
Early results from last Friday 's election suggested that his Sweet Scent of Service coalition had won just three out of 15 seats on the symbolically important Tehran city council , foiling Mr Ahmadinejad 's plan to oust the mayor and replace him with an ally .
The outcome appeared to be mirrored elsewhere , with councils throughout Iran returning a majority of reformists and moderate fundamentalists opposed to Mr Ahmadinejad .
Compounding his setback was the success of Hashemi Rafsanjani , an influential pragmatist and fierce critic of the president 's radical policies .
Mr Rafsanjani - whom Mr Ahmadinejad defeated in last year 's presidential election - received the most votes in elections to the experts ' assembly , a clerical body empowered to appoint and remove Iran 's supreme leader .
By contrast , Ayatollah Mohammed - Taghi Mesbah - Yazdi , Mr Ahmadinejad 's presumed spiritual mentor , came sixth .
Analysts attributed Mr Rafsanjani 's resurgence to his newly - found status as a saviour of the reformists , the liberal movement that shunned him as a hated symbol of the establishment when it held power .
Mr Rafsanjani has been increasingly identified with reformers since last year 's presidential election and many voters turned to him to voice anger at Mr Ahmadinejad .
Reformists hailed the poll - billed by many as Mr Ahmadinejad 's first electoral test since taking office - as a "" major defeat "" for the president , but they also warned that the slowness in declaring returns could indicate an underhand attempt to rig the outcome .
The interior ministry , which is in the hands of Mr Ahmadinejad 's supporters , oversees the counting of ballots .
"" The initial results of elections throughout the country indicate that Mr Ahmadinejad 's list has experienced a decisive defeat nationwide .
They were tantamount to a big ' no ' to the government 's authoritarian and inefficient methods , "" a statement from the pro - reform Islamic Iran Participation Front said .
Mr Ahmadinejad said the election established Iran as "" unique example of democracy and freedom "" but claimed his government had no vested interest in the outcome .
At 60 % , the turnout was unusually high for a local poll .
Among the president 's supporters , his sister Parvin was elected as a Tehran councillor , but his close confidant , Mehrdad Bazrpash - a former Basij militia leader , failed to win election .
The Tehran results represented a victory for the mayor , Mohammed Baqer Qalibaf , a pragmatic conservative and former national police chief who is seen as a future presidential rival to Mr Ahmadinejad .
With around half the ballots counted , projections showed his supporters winning seven seats , with reformists and an independent taking another five . ""
Mr Qalibaf is a rising star and a man to watch .
His popularity is on the rise , "" said an analyst who requested anonymity . ""
Ahmadinejad 's camp made a similar mistake to the reformists while they were in power .
They could n't agree on a single electoral list and had n't delivered on some of their promises but were confident people would still vote for them . """
2006-12-18,"Iranian student activists who staged an angry protest against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad last week have gone into hiding in fear for their lives after his supporters threatened them with revenge .
One student fled after being photographed holding a banner reading , "" Fascist president , the polytechnic is not for you "" , during Mr Ahmadinejad 's visit to Tehran 's Amir Kabir university .
At least three others have gone underground after being seen burning his picture .
Vigilantes from the militant Ansar - e Hezbollah group have been searching for them .
In a startling contrast to the acclaim Mr Ahmadinejad has received in numerous recent appearances around Iran , he faced chants of "" Death to the dictator "" as he addressed a gathering in the university 's sports hall last week .
Several hundred students forced their way in to voice anger over a clampdown on universities since he became president last year .
While his aides played down the incident , the Guardian has learned details of the violent and chaotic events .
The disclosures came yesterday as early returns from Friday 's council elections indicated that Mr Ahmadinejad 's hardline supporters had failed in their attempt to take control of several key local authorities .
Turnout was estimated at about 60 % after reformers urged liberal - minded electors to vote in large numbers to protest against the government 's policies .
Last Monday 's university demonstration triggered violent clashes between student activists and crowds of Basij militia , who were there to support the president .
A shoe was thrown at Mr Ahmadinejad while a student had his nose broken by an aide to a cabinet minister .
Protesters later surrounded the president 's car , prompting a security guard to fire a stun grenade to warn them off .
Four cars in the presidential convoy collided in their haste to leave .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's staff later insisted he had remained calm and ordered that the students should go unpunished .
But some of those present say he accused them of being paid United States agents who would be confronted . ""
He threatened us directly , saying that what we were doing was against the wishes of the nation , "" said Babak Zamanian , a spokesman for Amir Kabir university 's Islamic students ' committee . ""
After that , the students protested even more sharply , calling him a lying religious dictator and shouting , ' Forget America and start thinking about us ! '
"" We were chanting , ' Get lost Ahmadinejad ! ' and ' Ahmadinejad - element of discrimination and corruption . '
You could see from his face that he was really shocked .
He was n't flashing his usual smile , and at one stage I thought he was going to cry .
He told his supporters to respond with a religious chant hailing Ahmadinejad , but he was so shaken he was actually chanting it himself . ""
Another student said : "" He was trying to keep control of himself , but you could see he was angry and upset . ""
Witnesses say Mr Ahmadinejad also tried to ridicule the students by referring to the university disciplinary code , under which those with three penalty points are suspended from studies . ""
He joked that he was going to issue a presidential order for those with three stars to be enlisted as sergeants in the army .
That made the students really angry , "" said Mr Zamanian .
The university authorities ' contentious use of the disciplinary code was said to be a trigger for last week 's protest .
About 70 students have been suspended and threatened with expulsion for various political activities , including writing articles critical of the government .
Last month , the authorities demolished two building belonging to the Islamic students ' committee - a moderate grouping representing diverse opinions .
An elected student body was also disbanded .
Women students have been told to wear conservative dress and remove any makeup .
In this atmosphere , activists at Amir Kabir university - a traditional hotbed of political activism - regarded Mr Ahmadinejad 's visit as a deliberate provocation and decided to protest .
While many chanted , a hard core waved banners and burned his portrait , some ignoring instructions to cover their faces .
The 21-year - old student holding the "" fascist president "" banner was among those threatened with expulsion .
He is said to be in grave danger after foreign news outlets , including the Guardian , published a picture of his gesture .
Friends say he went into hiding after being confronted by two vigilantes . ""
They said they would pull his father out of the grave [ an ancient Persian threat ] , "" said one student .
"" He is in real danger .
Vigilantes have been standing at the dormitory doors asking for him . ""
Students now fear an even fiercer crackdown .
"" We believe [ the authorities ] will react much worse than before , "" said Armin Salmasi , 26 , a leading activist .
"" We are already under constant surveillance .
The student movement in Iran is going to be driven underground - just like it was before the revolution . """

Backstory
Once a close associate of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , spiritual leader of Iran 's Islamic revolution , Hashemi Rafsanjani has held most senior positions , including president and parliamentary speaker .
His long career seemed over after last year 's crushing presidential election defeat by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
That setback followed a humiliating rebuff at the hands of reformists in parliamentary elections in 2000 .
Now , at 72 , he is poised to become the most powerful figure in the assembly of experts , a body which appoints and supervises the supreme leader .
He will be in a position to dilute the influence of Ayatollah Mohammed - Taghi Mesbah - Yazdi , an ultra - radical close tothe president .
Some observers believe he may use his status to counterbalance the president 's aggressively anti - western foreign policy ."
2006-12-19,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , today said UN sanctions would not stop Iran from enriching uranium .
The show of defiance came as the UN security council moved closer to adopting a resolution after months of wrangling .
Russia said today a new draft met most of its concerns . ""
The new draft resolution , which has been drawn up by the European troika ( Britain , France and Germany ) and is now being debated within the UN security council , takes most of our approaches into consideration , "" the Russian foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , told the news service Interfax .
Russia , which has close economic ties with Tehran , and China have been reluctant to approve too tough a resolution , which has been in the works since Iran 's failure to comply with an August 31 deadline to suspend uranium enrichment .
To meet Russian and Chinese concerns that the initial resolution was too broad , the draft has been revised to specify exactly what materials and technology would be prohibited , and to name affected individuals and companies .
The revised draft also removed a reference to a nuclear facility being built by the Russians at Bushehr in south - west Iran .
The facility , expected to go online in late 2007 , would be Iran 's first atomic power plant .
Mr Ahmadinejad today warned Britain , France and Germany that Iran will consider their support for any sanctions as an act of hostility .
Speaking a day after election results indicated his allies suffered an embarrassing defeat in local council elections , the Iranian president said : "" These three European countries should know that if they insist on preventing the Iranian nation from its path , the Iranian nation will consider their behaviour as enmity and an act of hostility , and will change its behaviour towards them accordingly . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad also said it was shameful for the world to turn a blind eye to an apparent Israeli admission that it has nuclear weapons while continuing to pressure Iran to give up its programme .
"" They shamelessly remain silent or smile in consent towards the official announcement by the Zionist occupying regime possessing nuclear weapons , but insist , using their influence in global organisations , to impose so - called sanctions against the Iranian nation , "" he said .
Mr Ahmadinejad was referring to an interview aired in Germany last week , when the Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , appeared to include Israel in a list of nuclear states ."
2006-12-19,"From a distance , last week 's "" holocaust conference "" in Tehran was the latest in a series of well - crafted propaganda own - goals scored by the populist president of Iran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The international cries of outrage it caused were predictable and the Daily Telegraph 's conclusion was typical of the western world 's reaction , describing "" Iran under its present leadership "" as "" a dangerously hateful and malevolent force whose intentions in the Middle East can never be other than malign and destabilising "" .
Furthermore John Bolton , America 's former UN representative , is about to carve himself new employment by taking Ahmadinejad to the international court at The Hague , for "" incitement to genocide "" .
I believe that the event was misunderstood and misinterpreted in Britain and as a result the western reaction both in terms of words and actions it may generate will misfire and cause further misery , misunderstanding and conflict .
I believe that Ahmadinejad , much like the elected Hamas leadership , represents not only a danger but also an opportunity for long lasting peace and stability .
I believe that engagement with Iran is the best and only way forward .
The west has had a habit of choosing who it regards as sensible and "" moderate "" leaders to engage with .
The result has been the mess we see .
There is an opportunity here to engage with a point of view that resonates with the masses throughout the region .
It is n't the only point of view , and I am not suggesting that it is necessarily correct , but the view that holds Israel as the malign root cause of all the ills and misfortunes befalling the Middle East seems to be that held the majority .
Even in Iran , which paradoxically has one of the most pro - western and pro American populations in the Middle East , most agree with their president about Israel .
I ca n't think of any other subject on which he would find popular support on such a scale .
Although I ca n't venture to guess at the president 's personal views , and some unsavoury characters were among the invitees , it would be totally off the mark to describe Iran as having institutionally anti - semitic policies .
Iran is host to a Jewish community of 30,000 - the largest in the Middle East outside Israel .
By all accounts , its members suffer no special oppression or restriction beyond that endured by the average citizen , have representation in the political process ( such as it is ) and are even free to visit their relatives in Israel without harassment .
Compared to the so - called moderate states in the region ( read brutal , corrupt dictatorships allied to the west ) , Iran is a haven of security and tolerance for its ancient and pretty well - integrated Jewish community .
When was the last time the Saudi king visited a synagogue or church ?
Oh , I forgot - they do n't allow places of worship even for other Muslim sects , never mind other religions .
Attempts by elements in the conservative judiciary and intelligence services to create discord by creating Jewish scapegoats during the Khatami presidency famously misfired .
A sham trial of 12 people accused of spying for Israel in Shiraz collapsed after some of the defendants turned up at court wearing medals they had earned fighting as volunteers during the war with Iraq .
The members of minorities are n't required to take combat roles , or are excused from military service ; this shocked the nation and shamed the prosecutors .
By hosting the conference the present administration represented a minority point of view on how best to deal with Israel , inside the system , and the population at large .
These sorts of circuses only really exist at the symbolic level , are part of the internal discourse of Iranian politics , and are aimed at an audience at home and in the region - they have no implications in terms of actual policy .
This is , firstly , because the powers of the president are curtailed by the constitution ( he has , for example , no powers to declare war or peace ) and secondly , because after his earlier remarks about "" wiping Israel from the map "" , Ahmadinejad was strongly rebuked by his boss Ayatollah Khamenei , the supreme leader , and a consultative body to "" advise "" him on foreign policy was created ( which included ministers he had sacked and candidates he had defeated in the election ) .
Iran 's semi - democratic political system has a series of checks and balances that at times seem more democratic and better functioning than the US .
( The system wo n't allow the president to declare war or set actual foreign policy , to abolish the ban on women watching football matches , or to force US citizens to be fingerprinted at the border in retaliation for American fingerprinting of people born in Iran , and has rejected his nominees for the post of oil minister five times , but it ca n't somehow prevent him from setting up a conference . )
The only purpose of bizarre events like last week 's conference or its predecessor ( the infamous cartoon show in Tehran ) is as PR spectacle , however ham - fisted and clumsy .
Officially , it is a direct response to those Danish cartoons .
They are an attempt to demonstrate that there are taboos and holy cows in the west , too , and that people there are also persecuted for having opinions .
He meant to tell his fellow countrymen who are yearning for freedom , that even in the very western civilisation they so idealise there are red lines ( a favourite catchphrase of the regime 's censors and prosecutors ; journalists and opposition politicians are constantly reminded that there are "" red lines "" , the crossing of which the regime would not tolerate , in order to propagate an atmosphere of self censorship ) .
This is totally in keeping with the president 's recent clampdowns on satellite dishes , internet access and newspaper closure .
It is a rhetorical response in a dialogue between secularism and religion .
It would be worthwhile to consider the dynamics that brought him to power in the first place .
In 2005 , once Ahmadinejad had qualified for the second round of the presidential elections , an Iranian friend of mine who used to live in France remarked that , as with Chirac v Le Pen in France 's 2002 elections , "" we have also ended up with having to choose between the crook and the fascist "" .
The French people had the good sense to choose the crook .
Iranians , on the other hand , tired of the all - prevailing corruption , chose the honest fascist .
The former road sweeper touches something very deep in the Iranian psyche .
His small stature suggests an undernourished childhood , the lines on his face tell of years of hardship as he pulled himself through the education system ( eventually ending up with a PhD in the least glamorous subject possible : traffic management ) , and of his hard work at less glittering end of politics through the governorships of far - flung , unimportant parts of the country until coming to national prominence by being elected mayor of Tehran .
( In an election that was largely boycotted by reformist groups , who stupidly overestimated their own significance and the size of their support - they thought that by their withdrawal from the scene they would either shame or disturb the entrenched conservatives .
Having so failed to learn from their mistake during the municipal and parliamentary elections , the reformists went on to make the same mistake a third time .
Unluckily for them , the little guy in the terrible suit was there yet again to reap the rewards . )
In exasperation , I asked a relative in Iran how a retired university lecturer , educationalist and a female one for that matter could vote for someone like him .
She said something that caught me totally by surprise : "" I voted for him because his shoes were covered in dust . ""
The expression khaki , from which the English word denoting the colour emanates , is from the Persian and means "" dusty "" .
Furthermore , it is the equivalent of what an R&amp;B star might call "" keeping it real "" .
Yes , Mahmoud is indeed from the "" block "" .
Ahmadinejad passed the authenticity test , while the reform movement is seen as a middle - class club .
This is the earnest new president .
A man who publicly declares a sense of nostalgia for one of the darkest periods of Iranian history , the bloody and devastating eight - year war with Iraq , while most still mourn the needless death and the wanton - and still mostly under - repaired - destruction .
There is a tendency that includes the president and that longs for the sense of togetherness , revolutionary zeal and common sacrifice that saw the country through a period in which it felt heroically alone against the world .
Perhaps in the make - up of a man like Ahmadinejad ( and the class he represents ) there is something comforting about being alone and against the world , the righteous outsider and the underdog with the heart of gold .
This is the class that offered the greatest sacrifices , carried the heaviest burdens of the revolution , and tasted none of their fruits .
Ahmadinejad 's conference was hardly the most sensible idea of the moment .
But it 's not as absurd as John Bolton taking Ahmadinejad to the international court at The Hague , for "" incitement to genocide "" , the final disconnection of a bankrupt ideology from reality .
Here we have a member of a gang responsible directly for the deaths of more than half a million people going to a court which he previously refused to recognise not as the accused but as the plaintiff .
If they 're looking for new ways out of the ongoing messes they 've made in the Middle East , the western powers could show some intelligence for once and choose to talk to men with dust on their shoes , instead of convivial , sharp - suited businessmen and princes , better known and loved in casinos and brothels in Monte Carlo and London than on the streets of their homelands .
If they did , we might eventually move forward a little ."

Speaking in Dubai at the end of his five - day tour of the region , the prime minister called on moderate Muslim states to unite in combating Islamic extremists , such as the hardline regime of the Iranian President , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Mr Blair said that Iran wanted "" to pin us back in Lebanon , in Iraq and in Palestine "" , and went on to criticise the "" indifference "" of many world leaders towards its nuclear ambitions .
He said elements of the government of Iran were "" openly supporting terrorism in Iraq to stop a fledgling democratic process , trying to turn out a democratic government in Lebanon , flouting the international community 's desire for peace in Palestine - at the same time as denying the Holocaust "" . ""
And yet , "" Mr Blair continued , "" a large part of world opinion is frankly almost indifferent .
It would be bizarre if it were n't deadly serious . ""
Some Iraqi politicians , mainly Sunni Muslims , have accused Tehran of fuelling sectarian violence by supporting Shia militias .
Tehran also backs the Lebanese guerrilla group and opposition party Hizbullah , which is leading a drive for early elections after failing to obtain veto power in government .
Meanwhile , Iraq 's vice president claimed Mr Blair had been "" brainwashed "" by George Bush into dropping his support for a timetable for US and UK forces to withdraw from the country .
Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York yesterday , Tareq al - Hashemi said the prime minister had originally supported his proposal to announce a timetable for withdrawal .
In a later interview with the World Tonight on BBC Radio 4 last night , Mr Hashemi said Mr Blair appeared "" willing and interested "" to raise the matter with Mr Bush when they discussed it several months ago .
But once Mr Blair flew out to Washington and met with the US president he appeared to change his mind , said Mr Hashemi . ""
He promised to take up this matter with President Bush within a couple of days because he was planning to fly to Washington at that time . ""
But I was observing the joint press conference that he made with President Bush after his visit
and I saw him talking about something quite different . ""
Mr Hashemi speculated Mr Bush opposed declaring a timetable for withdrawal "" to avoid passing wrong messages to terrorism "" ."
2007-01-11,"An Iranian news website has been closed and two of its senior executives arrested after it displayed footage showing the country 's tourism chief at a female dance show .
Esfandiyar Rahim Mashaei , head of the cultural heritage and tourism organisation and a deputy of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , was seen sitting just a few feet from unveiled dancers in breach of Iran 's strict Islamic laws prohibiting women from dancing in front of men .
He appeared to applaud several times during the performance , staged at an Islamic tourist exhibition in Istanbul .
Mr Ahmadinejad was embroiled in a similar controversy last month after television footage showed him attending a female song and dance ceremony at the Asian Games in Qatar .
Fundamentalist MPs said his presence undermined Iran 's Islamic revolution but aides claimed the president had left before the end of the ceremony .
Mr Rahim Mashaei reacted furiously when the Iranews agency posted the latest film on its website after it was passed on by an MP .
He invited the agency 's managing director , Meysam Zaman - Abadi , and its political editor , Mohammed Reza Zomorodian , to his office for a "" friendly chat "" .
They were arrested on arrival but released after 48 hours .
However , access to the agency 's website remains blocked .
Mr Rahim Mashaei acknowledges attending the performance but claims that the footage showing him applauding is faked .
He also said he complained to organisers that the exhibition was "" not Islamic "" .
Now he has lodged a legal complaint with Iran 's revolutionary court against two MPs who have written to Mr Ahmadinejad demanding an explanation for Mr Rahim Mashaei 's conduct .
He alleges they are targeting him in a deliberate attempt to undermine the government .
However , one of the MPs , Emad Afrough - chairman of the influential parliamentary cultural committee - said Mr Rahim - Mashaei 's behaviour threatened Iran 's Islamic system .
"" The presence of the president 's deputy was not appropriate - we expect more from officials of the Islamic Republic .
Government officials should avoid taking part in such events and when they happen unexpectedly , they should react appropriately by leaving the scene , "" he told the semi - official Fars news agency .
Religious groups close to senior ayatollahs are believed to be organising public protests against Mr Rahim Mashaei , who was caught up in a row last year after a Turkish journalist quoted him as saying that wearing Islamic hijab was not obligatory for women in Iran .
He subsequently denied the remarks ."
2007-01-16,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has suffered a potentially fatal blow to his authority after the country 's supreme leader gave an apparent green light for MPs to attack his economic policies .
In an unprecedented rebuke , 150 parliamentarians signed a letter blaming Mr Ahmadinejad for raging inflation and high unemployment and criticising his government 's failure to deliver the budget on time .
They also condemned him for embarking on a tour of Latin America - from which he returns tomorrow - at a time of mounting crisis .
The signatories included a majority of the president 's former fundamentalist allies , now apparently seeking to distance themselves as his prestige wanes .
MPs also criticised Mr Ahmadinejad 's role in the UN security council dispute over Iran 's nuclear programme amid growing evidence that the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has ordered him to stay silent on the issue .
The supreme leader , who was hitherto loyal to the president , is said to blame Mr Ahmadinejad for last month 's UN resolution imposing sanctions over Iran 's refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment .
Ayatollah Khamenei has ultimate authority on foreign policy , and is rumoured to be so disillusioned with Mr Ahmadinejad 's performance that he has refused to meet him on occasion .
In a further indicator , Mohammad Reza Bahonar , the leader of parliament 's fundamentalists and a former lieutenant who helped the president choose his cabinet , denounced Mr Ahmadinejad 's economic policies as "" wrong "" and told him to stop blaming others .
Impeached The mounting criticism is fuelling speculation that Mr Ahmadinejad is politically doomed .
Observers have even suggested he might be impeached and removed from office . ""
Ahmadinejad 's golden era is over and his honeymoon with the supreme leader is finished .
He has problems even meeting the supreme leader , "" said an Iranian political commentator , Eesa Saharkhiz . ""
The countdown to his dismissal has already begun .
There is a probability that he can not even finish his current four - year period . ""
Signs of Mr Ahmadinejad 's declining stock have emerged less than a month after a crushing defeat in local authority elections , when only a fifth of his supporters won seats .
His most powerful political rival , Hashemi Rafsanjani , also topped the poll in elections to the expert 's assembly , a body empowered to appoint and supervise the supreme leader .
Mr Rafsanjani has been a vocal critic of the president 's strident anti - western rhetoric and has urged compromise on the nuclear issue .
Pragmatists within the Islamic leadership claim that Mr Ahmadinejad 's inflammatory rhetoric , including a declaration that Iran would not suspend uranium enrichment for "" even one day "" , sank any chance of a deal .
Two recent newspaper articles suggested that this is now the official view .
Jomhouri Islami , which has previously carried unsigned articles by the ayatollah , accused Mr Ahmadinejad of endangering public support for the nuclear programme by hijacking it as a personal cause to disguise his government 's economic failings .
"" Turning the nuclear issue into a propaganda slogan gives the impression that you , to cover up flaws in the government , are exaggerating its importance .
If people get the impression that the government is exaggerating the nuclear case to divert attention from their demands , you will cause this national issue to lose public support , "" the newspaper wrote .
The newspaper , Hamshari , whose director , Hossein Entezami , is a member of Iran 's nuclear negotiating team , was more blunt : "" At the very moment when the nuclear issue was about to move away from the UN security council , the fiery speeches of the president have resulted in the adoption of two resolutions [ against Iran ] .
"" Reminder "" Jomhouri Islami is the affirming voice of Iran 's political system and of the wishes of the supreme leader and high - ranking officials , so its criticism of Ahmadinejad 's political behaviour smacks of a serious reminder to him , "" said Mohammad Atrianfar , director of the recently banned reformist newspaper Shargh .
An uncharacteristically subdued response by the president to last Thursday 's seizure by US forces of five Iranian citizens in Iraq - described by the Tehran government as "" diplomats "" - is being seen as a sign that warnings are being heeded .
But Iran 's deepening economic woes , which prompted Sunday 's letter from MPs , suggest that the worst may have yet to come for a man elected on promises to raise living standards and distribute the nation 's oil wealth more evenly .
Those pledges jar with increasingly grim realities .
Inflation is higher than when Mr Ahmadinejad took office 17 months ago , while unemployment , officially estimated at 12 % but probably much higher , has not improved .
Uncontrolled inflation has resulted in soaring food prices and has had a drastic effect on the housing market .
Anecdotal evidence suggests house prices and rents in Tehran have risen 50 % in six months .
In a poignant development , the government plans to ration petrol to cut rising import costs incurred by Iran 's lack of refinery capacity .
The proposal gives an ironic twist to Mr Ahmadinejad 's election promise to put the country 's oil wealth "" on people 's tables "" .
The president 's growing army of opponents blame the situation on the government 's chaotic approach .
The failure to deliver a budget bill on time is being attributed to Mr Ahmadinejad 's decision to disband the management and planning organisation , a government agency responsible for setting spending priorities but which upset the president by opposing some of his costlier proposals .
Critics believe the economic situation is urgent and that Mr Ahmadinejad 's place is at home and not in Latin America .
Backstory One hundred and fifty of Iran 's 290 MPs signed the letter condemning President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's economic policies .
Government figures put the inflation rate at 10 - 15 % .
Anecdotal experience suggests that the figure is higher .
More than 17 million Iranians voted for the president in his election victory over Hashemi Rafsanjani in June 2005 .
However , the country 's supreme leader - the most powerful figure in its theocratic system - is chosen by clerics .
The supreme leader has the final say on foreign affairs , military matters and a range of other areas .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's four - day tour of Latin America took him to Venezuela , to meet President Hugo Chávez , to Nicaragua , where he met President Daniel Ortega , and to Ecuador , where he attended President Rafael Correa 's inauguration .
All three men share the Iranian president 's hostility to Washington and President George Bush ."
2007-01-16,"That Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , a hero in Cairo and other Arab capitals for his anti - Israeli diatribes and a feted leader in Latin America 's new leftist states for his championship of the rights of the poor , is more popular abroad than at home should not come as a surprise .
Ahmadinejad won the Iranian presidential elections in 2005 largely because of his promises to redistribute wealth , to create jobs , to attack corruption and , more generally , to shift the balance in the Islamic Republic away from a prosperous , privileged and vocal middle class toward a relatively neglected working class and peasantry .
It was always doubtful that he would succeed , in part because Iran 's economic problems are so deep rooted .
For half a century oil money has had its usual paradoxical effect , often ennabling governments to spend freely but also giving traders and importers an unnatural primacy and undermining both agriculture and industry .
Ahmadinejad has made it more difficult for himself by a combination of economic and political mismanagement .
On the economic front , he has gathered together a group of ministers , experts and heads of parastatal agencies who are not well qualified for their positions and , with some exceptions , not very good at them .
There has been considerable social spending , but the net result has been few jobs and an increase in inflation , made worse by the president 's decision , against technical advice , to drop interest rates to make loans to ordinary people more easily available .
They can now get the loans but , since everything is more expensive , this hardly counts as progress .
Ahmadinejad has also dissipated much of the national reserve fund built up by his predecessors to give the country a buffer should oil prices fall , yet with not much to show for these disbursements .
In a cold winter , Tehran , for instance , has been simultaneously suffering power cuts , shortages of heating oil , and a collapse of its mobile phone networks .
Iranians , conscious of their country 's wealth and convinced of its basic technical and scientific ability , are very sensitive to such signs of incompetence .
Politically , he has been equally inept .
It is often forgotten in the west that Ahmadinejad was far from the preferred candidate of all the various groups and factions in the Iranian political establishment that can be termed conservative .
He had their initial gratitude because he had delivered the victory over reformists and pragmatists which they were united in wanting .
But that was a declining currency and as Ahmadinejad disregarded advice , failed to build coalitions in parliament , and advanced his own friends and relatives , his support dwindled .
The fact that 150 out of 290 members of the Majlis were ready to sign a petition against him also shows that the president has alienated Ayatollah Ali Khameini , the supreme leader , and the single most powerful figure in Iran 's fragmented political system .
A dismal performance in recent local elections and a rebuff in those for the Assembly of Experts complete the picture of a man who has failed to deliver , both to his core supporters among the people , and to the political establishment which had once seen him as a solution to the problem of maintaining popular legitimacy .
Against this background , the president 's attacks on Israel , his espousal of Holocaust denial , and his confrontational style on nuclear matters have come to be seen as gesture politics intended to divert attention from his domestic failures .
Iranians may not have a warm attitude to Israel , they may feel that the Holocaust has been used to defend policies to which it is not relevant , and they may also take the view that Iran has a right to nuclear development , including weapons if necessary .
But this not the same as being in favour of a constant , and counter productive , series of over wrought proclamations on these issues .
How much power and support Ahmadinejad retains is nevertheless not that easy to measure .
Poorer Iranians , and the more devout , may be disappointed , but probably still regard him as their man .
What he appears to have lost is that wider support in Iran , across and even beyond the conservative constituency , which he could have had if he had acted more wisely and less wilfully .
The danger in international terms , as the United States begins to put more pressure , both economic and military , on the Iranians , is that what is intended to be a calibrated exercise will slip out of control as an Iranian regime which is now in some disarray overreacts to US moves .
Such a development might represent a sort of escape for Ahmadinejad , just as it might for some policy makers in the United States .
We can hope he shows better judgement in these matters than he has so far displayed ."
2007-01-17,"The open letter to Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by a majority of the country 's MPs , criticizing his economic policies , illustrates the checks and balances that Iran 's constitution provides .
As it is , Iran 's parliament , called Majlis , is entitled to impeach the popularly elected president if it finds him to be incompetent .
It did so in 1981 and removed from office Abol Hassan Bani - Sadr , the first president of the Islamic Republic of Iran .
In that sense the power of the Iranian legislature is on par with that of the United States Congress .
Yet there are some differences .
In Iran , the decision of the 290-member Majlis has to be endorsed by the supreme leader .
In America , while the House of Representative can initiate the impeachment proceedings , it is the Senate which can impeach the president but only by a two - thirds majority .
Overall , though , if one sets aside the actuality that the American constitution is secular while the Iranian document is theocratic - with the official name of the country , Islamic Republic of Iran , highlighting the fact - their political systems have much in common .
As in America , so in Iran , the highest official is elected by an electoral college .
That is how , George W Bush won the presidency in November 2000 even though he received 400,000 votes less than his Democratic rival Al Gore .
In the US an electoral college consists of the representatives of each of the 50 constituent states based on the state 's population .
Depending on which candidate has secured a majority of the ballots in a state , its representatives travel to Washington to form an electoral college and deliver the votes .
In Iran , it is the directly elected 86-member Assembly of Experts that acts as an electoral college and chooses the supreme leader .
As the term "" expert "" means "" expert in Islam "" , only qualified mullahs are allowed to become members of this assembly .
The eight - year tenure of the Assembly of Experts decides the tenure of the supreme leader as well .
Each new assembly must either re - elect the incumbent by a majority vote or replace him .
The assembly has a sub - committee which monitors the performance of the supreme leader .
Every six months it submits a report to the Assembly , but does not publish it .
Such secretiveness is a major drawback of the Iranian system .
As in America , so in Iran , power is fractured .
The US has five major centres of power - the White House , the Congress , the Supreme Court , corporate and other lobbies , and the media .
In Iran there are five primary centres of power : the supreme leader who is both the spiritual and temporal ruler of Iran , the ultimate arbiter of power ; the directly elected Assembly of Experts which elects him and monitors his performance ; the president , the chief executive ; the Majlis , the legislative organ ; and the judiciary .
Unlike in America , in Iran there are two secondary centre of power : the Council of Guardians ( of the constitution ) , which ensures that legislation is compatible with the Sharia , the Islamic law , and the Iranian constitution , and supervises elections to the Assembly of Experts , the presidency and the Majlis ; and the Expediency Council which resolves differences between the President , the Majlis and the Guardians Council .
All of the Expediency Council members and half of the Guardians Council members are appointed by the supreme leader , as also is the judiciary chief .
At different times , each of these centres of power has shown its independence .
For instance , when on the eve of the Majlis elections in 2004 , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamanei publicly called on the Guardians Council to reconsider the number of reformist candidates they had disqualified from contesting the poll , the council went on to increase the number of disqualified reformist hopefuls .
Last year when President Ahmadinejad appealed to Majlis members not to pass a law requiring all US citizens to be fingerprinted on arrival in Iran - as a quid pro quo to the rule enforced by the US immigration authorities for Iranians visiting America - they rejected his plea by 136 votes to four .
The critical letter addressed to the president by 150 Majlis deputies is , of course , a far more serious affair , but well within the parameters of the Iranian constitution ."
2007-01-22,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , defied his domestic critics yesterday by vowing not to retreat from his nuclear and economic policies despite growing pressure .
Addressing MPs , he dismissed last month 's UN security council resolution imposing sanctions for Iran 's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment , and said further embargoes would not halt the country 's nuclear programme .
He also claims to have tamed inflation amid an outcry over rising prices . ""
The UN resolution was born dead and even if they issue 10 more of such resolutions it will not affect Iran 's economy and policies , "" Mr Ahmadinejad said in a televised speech to parliament introducing next year 's budget .
"" We have become a nuclear country today without promising anything to the major powers and this is a great victory that belongs to the people and the parliament . ""
His comments represented a riposte to criticism from MPs and the media blaming his belligerent anti - western rhetoric for the resolution , which many fear has set Iran on a course of confrontation .
They coincided with the start of three days of weapons tests in the Kavir desert , about 60 miles south - east of Tehran .
State television reported that short - range Zalzal and Fajr-5 missiles would be fired in the manoeuvres , which follow an American decision to send a second aircraft carrier , USS Stennis , to the Gulf .
The UN sanctions ban the sale of technology and materials that can be used in Iran 's nuclear programme , which the country 's leaders insist is peaceful .
They have been accompanied by intensified US moves to restrict the international dealings of Iranian banks .
Even the president 's former allies in parliament say the sanctions are exacerbating runaway inflation and could plunge the country 's economy into crisis ."
2007-01-24,"Iran 's beleaguered president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , is facing a powerful challenge from his fiercest political rival for control of the country 's nuclear and economic policies .
Hashemi Rafsanjani , a pragmatic conservative who was defeated by Mr Ahmadinejad in the 2005 presidential election , believes Iran may have to yield to western demands to suspend uranium enrichment in order to save the country 's Islamic system from collapse .
He is trying to persuade the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - who has the final say in all state matters - that further negotiations are essential to avoid a potentially disastrous conflict with the US or Israel .
Mr Rafsanjani demonstrated his growing influence over the nuclear issue in a meeting today with Britain 's ambassador to Tehran , Geoffrey Adams .
He told Mr Adams that Iran was willing to submit to "" any verifying measures by the responsible authorities "" to prove the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme , which many in the west suspect is aimed at developing an atomic bomb .
Diplomatic sources said Mr Rafsanjani appeared to be offering full verification only as part of a negotiated future deal , rather than immediate access .
Iran this week announced that it had denied access to 38 inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency , the UN 's nuclear watchdog .
Mr Rafsanjani 's conciliatory stance contrasts starkly with Mr Ahmadinejad 's defiant opposition to the suspension of uranium enrichment .
The president 's rhetoric has been blamed in many circles for a recent UN security resolution imposing sanctions on Iran for its nuclear activities , which many in the west suspect is aimed at developing the atomic bomb .
Mr Ahmadinejad faced down his critics this week by vowing to continue his policies and declaring that 10 more UN resolutions would not deny Iran its nuclear rights .
He also told state television that "" wise voices "" in the US would prevent the Bush administration from launching a military strike against Iran .
Mr Rafsanjani - a former president and pillar of Iran 's political establishment - disagrees , and is understood to have formed a committee overseeing the nuclear negotiations .
The committee will assess whether the country 's international standing has been damaged by Mr Ahmadinejad 's radical statements . ""
Before the sanctions , Rafsanjani hoped Iran could obtain its enrichment objectives through mutual understanding with the west .
But now he thinks we have reached a dangerous point and that a step should be taken backwards in the hope that two forward can be taken later . "" said Mohammad Atrianfar , a respected political commentator and associate of Mr Rafsanjani . ""
He does n't see negotiation as a sign of weakness .
He wants to limit the impact of the sanctions and get Mr Khamenei and the government to accept that if Iran faces mounting sanctions or a military attack or any crisis which damages the economic life of the people , then there is a possibility of the whole system collapsing , "" he said .
"" Things have changed since the early days of the Islamic revolution , when people would sacrifice their lives .
Now they will only defend the system if it provides them a safe life . ""
Disclosure of Mr Rafsanjani 's move to re - establish himself comes after the Guardian last week reported that Mr Ahmadinejad 's authority was under pressure from critical MPs and an increasingly concerned Mr Khamenei .
His re - emergence contradicts widely - held assumptions that his influence had diminished following his presidential defeat .
His increasing prominence follows last month 's electoral triumph in topping the poll in elections to the experts ' assembly , an important clerical body .
Mr Rafsanjani also criticised Mr Ahmadinejad 's government this week for failing to privatise state enterprises , a policy agreed under Iran 's constitution and supported by Mr Khamenei .
He said Iran 's economy would be overtaken by poorer neighbouring countries if prized national assets remained under state control .
Mr Ahmadinejad - who has vowed to spread wealth more evenly and alleviate poverty - favours a bigger government role in the economy .
Mr Rafsanjani 's comments added to a chorus of anger over Mr Ahmadinejad 's economic policies , which have been widely denounced for stoking inflation and failing to cure unemployment .
Dismay over rising prices has driven supposedly like - minded MPs in the fundamentalist - dominated parliament to launch a petition summoning the president to answer questions .
It has so far gathered 63 signatures and needs only a further nine to be effective .
Meanwhile , proceedings are underway to impeach four of his ministers accused of incompetence . ""
Even though the majority of MPs are fundamentalists like Ahamdinejad , the level of dissatisfaction is much higher than previous governments faced from parliament , "" Akbar A'alami , a reformist MP told the Guardian . ""
The criticisms go beyond political groupings .
I think it has reached a critical level . ""
Presenting next year 's budget , an unrepentant Mr Ahmadinejad told MPs on Sunday that he had controlled inflation and said it was running at 12 % .
Independent estimates put it at 30 % .
Critics say rising food and housing costs are hurting the poor , whom Mr Ahmadinejad had pledged to help .
Insiders say anger towards the president is sufficient for a majority of MPs to want to impeach him and remove him from office .
However , Mr Khamenei is reluctant to sanction such a step , out of concern for the trauma it could inflict on the system rather than personal loyalty to the president .
Yet if the economy continues to deteriorate , Mr Ahmadinejad 's position could become vulnerable , some analysts think .
"" The supreme leader is absolutely sensitive to the rate of inflation , "" said Saeed Leylaz , an economic analyst .
"" He has issued one public criticism , three months ago when inflation was lower than it is now .
If it is even higher three months from now , then surely Mr Khamenei will not remain silent . """

2007-01-26,"The launch of Israel 's campaign to isolate Iran from world financial markets , which began yesterday with the visit of the former prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu to London , opens a new frontline in the already wizened and battle - scarred face of the Middle East .
The first salvo will be directed at western pension funds that invest in companies trading directly with Tehran .
A case will also be brought against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad under the 1948 Geneva convention on genocide , for having said that Israel should be wiped off the map .
But the offensive against the Iranian president , who has defied the world by carrying on with a programme to enrich uranium , purportedly for civilian use , goes wider and deeper than that .
The consensus among Israel 's senior defence and intelligence analysts attending the annual conference in Herzliya this week was that the traditional political map of the Middle East was changing .
The dominant Arab states of Egypt and Jordan , with whom Israel had cut deals , were declining in influence .
Iran and Turkey were rising as regional superpowers .
Pan - Arabism was being replaced by Islamism as the motivating ideology of the resistance to Israel 's occupation of the West Bank .
The vanguard of that resistance movement was no longer Fatah and the PLO , but Hizbullah and Hamas , an organisation with its roots in the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt .
Both militant groups were waging asymmetric warfare in the failed states of Lebanon and Palestine .
Looming over both was Iran , the chief paymaster and string - puller , and , if we are to believe Israeli intelligence , a future nuclear power .
However close Iran is to getting the bomb ( and US military analysts are noticeably cooler about the imminence of armageddon than their Israeli counterparts ) a convenient conclusion emerges from the current Israeli military consensus : yet again Israel faces an "" existential threat "" .
There have been a few of those since 1948 .
Yet again an implacable and irrational foe , this time a Persian one , is calling for Israel 's destruction .
And yet again Israel 's task is to stand up and fight for its existence , because we all know what happened in 1938 .
In other words none of this has anything to do with Israel 's treatment of the Palestinians , or the occupation of land that is now into its 40th year .
And yet there are opportunities which Israel can seize and which lie within its grasp .
True , the most likely option is that stalemate between Fatah and Hamas will continue .
A Palestinian civil war will probably not break out , but nor will peace .
Senior aides to the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , say he will give another two weeks for Hamas to agree to form a government of national unity .
If it refuses to recognise past agreements between the Palestinian Authority and Israel , which include the recognition of Israel , one of two things can happen .
Either new elections will be called or else
Mr Abbas could legally declare a state of emergency and form a series of temporary administrations .
And in this land temporary can last a long time .
Either way there are options for an Israel that is interested in the survival of a moderate Palestinian leader .
Israel can take a series of short steps that nudge the peace process on , without fundamentally compromising its security .
It can start releasing Palestinian prisoners .
It can pay out more of their tax revenues , which it has withheld .
It can vary the course of the security barrier , releasing more Palestinian land , and it can begin to lift the economic siege .
None of these measures are risk - free .
Letting farmers through the barriers that lie between their homes and their olive trees also increases the risk of a suicide bomber getting through , but there is also a risk in allowing a weak leader like Mr Abbas to get weaker .
The small steps always seem less attractive than the big ones .
A nuclear Iran is easier for Israel to contemplate than a Palestinian leader who wants peace ."
2007-01-28,"History is not littered with cases of heads of state being brought down by the price of tomatoes but , with his critics growing by the day , Iran 's President , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , could be in danger of earning such a distinction .
Besieged by denunciations of his economic and nuclear policies , the President was put further on the defensive last week by MPs complaining that the cost of tomatoes had soared to 30,000 rial ( £ 1.65 ) a kilo - an unthinkable price in a country where the average worker scrapes by on £ 225 a month .
Prices subsequently slipped back in response to the outcry .
But the startling statistic crystallised popular anger over runaway inflation , which has eaten into the living standards of the army of low - income Iranians whom Ahmadinejad came to office pledging to help .
The ever - combative President had a ready riposte .
The prices quoted were not representative , he claimed .
MPs should visit his local fruit and vegetable store in the middle - class Narmak neighbourhood in east Tehran , where tomatoes cost much less .
The tiny store sits around the corner from the modest home Ahmadinejad vacated on assuming the presidency .
According to staff , none of his family has shopped there for months .
The President might have been advised to have done so before recommending it as a haven for the thrifty .
He would have found a shop no longer stocking tomatoes due to their prohibitive price and an owner desperate to sell up . '
I want to change job .
It 's not a proper investment and it 's no longer profitable , ' said owner Hassan , 24 , who said rising prices had deterred many customers .
Wealthy hoarders , he said , were depriving the market of produce so they could sell at inflated prices .
But Hassan , who voted for Ahmadinejad , did not blame the profiteers . '
I blame the government - it comes from a lack of regulation , ' he said .
' There 's no stability .
My situation and that of many others was better before Ahmadinejad .
When he won I was happy because he did n't dress like a mullah and wore humble clothes , but he is no different .
If he had solved youth unemployment , people would have been happy . '
A few blocks away , traders at Kerman fruit and vegetable market voiced outrage .
Ibrahim Falali , 42 , said he was selling imported tomatoes from Pakistan to make up for shortfalls and high prices caused by the export of Iranian produce to Iraq .
Onions and potatoes were no longer on sale because customers balked at the prices , while the cost of a kilo of fish had risen from 90p to £ 1.50 .
Gripes over surging prices are just part of a broader critique against Ahmadinejad being framed by the media , former allies in parliament and powerful regime insiders close to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has the final say in all state matters .
They accuse him of failing to keep his economic promises to create jobs and reduce poverty while presiding over wasteful policies that have triggered inflation and threaten chaos .
But the charge sheet goes beyond economics .
Having argued for Iran 's nuclear programme with shrill anti - Western rhetoric , Ahmadinejad now stands accused of provoking Western enemies and of leaving Iran vulnerable to sanctions or military attack .
Last month , the UN security council passed a resolution imposing limited sanctions over Iran 's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment .
It gave Tehran 60 days to comply or face the possibility of further embargoes .
The Bush administration has begun pressing European banks to cut off transactions with state - owned Iranian banks said to be linked to the nuclear programme .
Meanwhile , leading Israeli figures threaten military strikes against Iran 's nuclear facilities .
Ahmadinejad 's opponents say he has inadvertently increased the threat through his uncompromising bluster and further accuse him of refusing to take it seriously .
The country 's Islamic system , they believe , could collapse under the burden of sanctions or from the repercussions of a military attack .
The President has taken a brazen approach to the criticism .
Presenting the coming year 's budget to parliament last Sunday , he insisted Iran would stick to its nuclear strategy .
He dismissed the capacity of sanctions to damage the economy and claimed to have reduced the country 's dependence on oil revenues .
On state television he brushed aside inflation as ' rumours ' and insisted the US was powerless to attack Iran . '
The important thing for us is to become a nuclear power and we have done so without any costs , ' he said .
But the ability of such defiant talk to rally the nation has worn thin .
Last week , Mohsen Rezai - a former revolutionary guard commander linked to Iran 's inner circle - said he believed an enemy attack was highly likely .
More threatening to Ahmadinejad 's authority is the increasing assertiveness of Hashemi Rafsanjani , a former President and head of the powerful expediency council .
Rafsanjani - whom Ahmadinejad defeated in the last presidential election - believes Iran faces a crisis and must negotiate on the nuclear case , even if it means backing down .
Rafsanjani last week voiced his concerns about the economy and the nuclear strategy to 100 MPs .
He said the expediency council would scrutinise Ahmadinejad 's budget and criticised ' high - ranking officials ' for under - estimating the international threat .
In remarks interpreted as designed to show the President 's waning influence , Rafsanjani described how a top - level official had been slapped down by Khamenei . '
We had a session with the supreme leader and a group of officials , ' he said . '
Somebody said , "" the threats are not serious and there is no need for concern "" , to which Ayatollah Khamenei replied , "" the threats are serious "" . '
The unnamed official is broadly assumed to have been Ahmadinejad .
Rafsanjani reminded MPs that the ' highest religious duty ' of officials was preserving Iran 's Islamic system - implying this might mean making painful compromises with the West .
Rafsanjani was pushing at an open door .
Parliament is in open revolt , believing the President guilty of incompetence , arrogance and self - indulgence .
Moves were afoot to rein him in even before Rafsanjani 's pep talk .
A petition is being circulated to summon Ahmadinejad for questioning over his economic and nuclear policies , while impeachment proceedings are under way against four ministers .
Emad Afrough , a fundamentalist MP , said parliament would start dictating to Ahmadinejad unless he learnt the art of consultation . '
The political situation is going to force the government to consult more .
If not , some issues be dictated to them , ' he said . '
The government can not count on the fundamentalists like before . '
A reformist MP , Akbar Aalami , said disenchantment had reached unprecedented levels . '
This government lacks the maturity to fulfil its legal duties and exercise authority , ' he said .
Prospects of Ahmadinejad 's impeachment and removal from office are widely dismissed .
But it is clear that he is running short of friends .
One of the few that could be found last week was shopping in the same fruit and veg store the President had cited in his defence .
Abdolreza Bazian , 38 , had known Ahmadinejad as a neighbour and fellow member of the volunteer Basij militia . '
He is a good man , ' he said .
' We have faced price rises but he is not the guilty one .
The blame lies with the foreign pressure being put on Iran . '"
2007-01-28,"There is a striking likeness in the expressions of George W Bush and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran as they confront each other over the issues of uranium enrichment and dominance in the Middle East .
It falls somewhere between the chastened and defiant playground bully .
This is unsurprising :
though not political equivalents , the two are really quite similar .
Both had little experience of government or international affairs before being carried to power on a tide of populist , religious conservatism .
Neither travelled abroad much , but they both had certain views about the world and the destiny of their nations .
They had all the answers , yet there was also a dangerous lack of seriousness in them which has now earned them both the scorn of their people and rebuffs from their elders .
We think of Bush as being the more unpopular of the two .
His approval ratings are at the level of Nixon 's just before he left the White House .
After an unconvincing performance in the State of the Union Address , his plans for the troop surge in Iraq were rejected by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and may now be voted down by the entire Senate .
Senior Republican senators such as Chuck Hagel and John Warner are furious that sensible suggestions contained in the Iraq Study Group Report have been ignored .
Although the President looked receptive when the report was delivered to him by James Baker , there has been no progress in policy , no evidence of any kind of deeper thinking in the White House .
Nothing except that familiar foggy , narrow - eyed truculence of Bush Junior in a tight spot .
This would be a depressing but for similar difficulties experienced by Ahmadinejad over the last few weeks .
Just as the senior Republican elders have turned on Bush , so Iran 's religious leaders are moving to restrain their President .
They criticise his bellicose foreign policy and the exceptionally poor record on promised reforms at home .
There is a sense of embarrassment among sophisticated Iranians about their President 's pronouncements , which surely rings a bell with Americans .
The most important sign - off disenchantment came in Jomhouri Islami , the newspaper owned by Iran 's supreme religious leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , which said in an editorial : ' Turning the nuclear issue into a propaganda issue gives the impression that to cover up the flaws in government you are exaggerating its importance . '
The paper also suggested that the President should speak about the nuclear issue less , stop provoking aggressive powers like the United States and concentrate on the daily needs of the people - ' those who voted for you on your promises ' .
Two weeks ago , 150 legislators sent a letter to Ahmadinejad openly attacking him for missing his budget deadline and blaming him for inflation and rising unemployment .
A loss of confidence in both men at home is important because it offers us a brief opportunity to assert diplomacy over the habits of rhetoric and escalation .
Although UN nuclear experts suggest the Iranians are at least five years from developing a bomb and delivery system , the Iranians are due to open a large uranium enrichment plant within a matter of weeks .
If this goes ahead , a peaceful solution will be much harder to find ; to decommission this new facility will require a loss of face for Ahmadinejad .
So the hawks in the West will begin the slow drumbeat for a first strike .
Indeed , it has already started .
For some weeks , the Daily Telegraph has been running a series of what , in my opinion , are extremely dubious stories all attributed to mysterious ' European defence officials ' and ' senior Western military sources ' .
A front - page story last week suggested that North Korea has offered to help Iran with a nuclear test within the year .
Apart from these shadowy spokesmen , it could offer no evidence , which is why the story was only seriously picked up in Israel .
In Israel , it is believed that the Iranians may be able to launch a nuclear warhead into its territory within three , not five , years .
Former Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has asked who will defend the Jews from a genocidal government in Iran if they do not themselves .
Israeli historian Benny Morris contributed this chilling thought to the Jerusalem Post . '
One bright morning in five to 10 years , perhaps a regional crisis , a day or a year or five years after Iran 's acquisition of the bomb , the mullahs in Qom will convene in secret session ... and give President Ahmadinejad the go - ahead . '
In Iran , 38 nuclear inspectors have been barred from entering the country in retaliation for the UN resolution introducing mild sanctions , and now the Iranians have installed a missile defence system ( supplied by the Russians ) to defend their nuclear facilities from air attacks .
The Americans have responded by moving another aircraft carrier into the region and by offering Patriot missile systems to Iran 's uneasy Arab neighbours .
Make no mistake : this a much more dangerous situation than Iraq and it is unfolding on the watch of a couple of second - raters .
It is true that few nations that have been more estranged over the last quarter of a century , but with the stakes so high , it seems extraordinary that America has no representation in Tehran and almost no contact except through the Swiss embassy .
As Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times reminded us last week , in 2003 , America rebuffed an advance made by the Iranians through the Swiss , which , in exchange for the lifting of sanctions , suggested the two countries work together on the capture of terrorists in Iraq , stabilising the country after invasion and coming to an agreement on uranium enrichment as well as the financing of Hizbollah and Hamas .
The offer , made almost two years before Ahmadinejad was elected , was layered with insincerity and bluff , but professional diplomats are used to this .
At least the two sides would have been talking and Tehran could have been held to account for some of the things that have been going on in Iraq .
But the situation is not beyond hope .
The West must realise that if a first strike takes place we have lost .
Whatever is destroyed in Iran , the Iranians will come back and produce a bomb that they may feel more entitled to use .
The clash of civilisations predicted by neocon academics for years will have moved a step closer to dominating the 21st century at the very moment when all civilisation needs to concentrate on the multiple threats presented by climate change .
What we must hope for is a collective act of will in Europe , and among wiser heads in Washington DC , which says it does n't have to be this way .
This is not impossible .
Only last week , representatives from 30 countries led by America and Saudi Arabia met in Paris to contribute to a £ 5bn fund to prop up Prime Minister Fouad Siniora 's government in Lebanon .
This was a diplomatic action taken by both Middle Eastern and Western powers to defend Lebanon against Iran 's proxies in the Hizbollah terrorist organisation , and it is exactly the right way to deal with Iran .
What can the British government do about Ahmadinejad ?
The first thing to is to recognise his failing support at home is an advantage that will be lost if the drumbeat to war is allowed to continue .
There is no reason why Tony Blair should not add to the call from the head of UN inspectors , Mohamed ElBaradei , for a time out in which sanctions would be suspended .
Blair still has a voice that is heard in the US .
He should consider making a speech which insists that Bush initiates direct diplomatic relations with Tehran as well as a renewed effort to create the two - state solution for Israel and Palestine .
He owes something to the cause of peaceful resolution and , besides , these are hardly controversial views : both have already been expressed by James Baker 's Iraq Study Group . henry.porter@observer.co.uk"
2007-01-30,"The honeymoon is over .
Iran 's controversial president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has finally come unstuck .
His popularity with the Iranian electorate - the subject of much incredulous analysis in 2005 - seems to be falling back at last , and the country 's latest exercise in populism seems to be reaping the rewards of unfulfilled promises bestowed with little attention to economic realities .
Those realities have sharpened with the onset of UN sanctions .
Ahmadinejad 's casual dismissal of the sanctions has apparently earned him an unprecedented rebuke from the supreme leader , Ayatollah Khamenei - reflecting growing concerns among the political elite , including many conservatives , who are increasingly anxious at Iran 's worsening international situation .
As if to emphasise this point , Hashemi Rafsanjani , Ahmadinejad 's defeated foe in the 2005 presidential election , echoed the condemnation of the president 's public complacency , stressing that the threats against Iran were very real .
Indeed , as a second US carrier group heads for the Gulf , there is belated questioning of the president 's competence .
His critics argue that not only does he appear to have courted the anger of the US , but his economic mismanagement and political nepotism have weakened the internal integrity of the Islamic republic - and proved to be a gift to Iran 's enemies .
Ahmadinejad was elected on a platform of anti - corruption and financial transparency , and few appreciated how rapidly he was intoxicated with the prerogatives of his office .
He very soon forgot the real help he had received in ensuring his election , basking in the belief that God and the people had put him in power .
Ahmadinejad soon had a view for all seasons : uranium enrichment .
Of course Iran would pursue this , and what 's more , sell it on the open market at knockdown rates .
As for interest rates , they were far too high for the ordinary borrower , so cut them immediately .
And then there was the Holocaust .
None of this might matter so much , if the president had based his rhetorical flourishes on solid policies .
But much to everyone 's surprise nothing dramatic materialised .
Ahmadinejad appeared to follow the dictum of his mentor , Ayatollah Khomeini - "" Economics is for donkeys "" .
Indeed , his policies could be defined as "" anything but Khatami "" ( his predecessor ) .
So the oil reserve fund was spent on cash handouts to the grateful poor , and the central bank , normally a bastion of prudence , was instructed to cut interest rates for small businesses .
These had the effect , as Ahmadinejad was warned , of pushing up inflation .
The rationale for high interest rates was to encourage the middle classes to keep their money in Iran .
Now they decided to spend it .
Richer Iranians , worried about rising international tension , decided it would be prudent to ship their money abroad .
This further weakened the rial , and added to inflationary pressure .
In the past few months the prices of most basic goods have risen , hurting the poor he was elected to help .
Moreover , far from investing Iran 's oil wealth in infrastructure to create jobs , he announced recently that Iran 's economy could support a substantially larger population , as if current unemployment was not a big enough problem .
Views such as these , along with his well publicised unorthodox religious convictions , have earned him the ridicule of political foes .
What is more striking perhaps is the growing concern of those who should be considered his allies , especially in the parliament .
These are people who supported him and expected results .
They expected their populist protege to overturn the heresy of reform .
Much to their irritation , not only has Ahmadinejad singularly failed to consolidate and extend his political base , the recent municipal elections saw his faction defeated throughout the country .
Traditional conservatives and reformists reorganised and hit back , ingeniously using technology to work round the various obstacles placed in front of them .
Now , over the past weeks , with biting weather , shortages of heating fuel are further raising the political temperature , while his political opponents point to the burgeoning international crisis for which the globetrotting president seems to have no constructive answer .
Talk has turned to impeachment .
Ironically , it is this very international crisis that may serve to save Ahmadinejad 's presidency , a reality that the president undoubtedly understood all too well .
As domestic difficulties mount , the emerging international crisis could at best serve as a rallying point , or at worst persuade Iran 's elite that a change of guard would convey weakness to the outside world .
There can be little doubt that US hawks will interpret recent events as proof that pressure works , and that any more pressure will encourage the hawks further .
Yet the reality is that while Ahmadinejad has been his own worst enemy , the US hawks are his best friends .
Ahmadinejad 's demise , if it comes , will have less to do with the international environment and more with his own political incompetence .
There is little doubt that it will take more than a cosmetic change to get Washington to listen to Iran .
But the real question mark , as the Baker - Hamilton commission found to its cost , is whether Washington is inclined to listen at all .

2007-02-05,"Tony Blair was under pressure today to open direct talks with Tehran over its alleged nuclear weapons programme , as a coalition of UK charities , religious bodies and thinktanks warned that an attack on Iran would be a "" disaster "" .
As the prime minister dropped a broad hint that he would work on the Middle East peace process after retiring this year , a report warned that an attack on Iran would expose British troops to attack , civilians to terrorism and release radiation in Iran .
The report by 15 organisations - backed by Britain 's former ambassador to Iran - comes as the US appears to be upping the ante in an increasingly hostile war of words with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the Iranian president .
The previous foreign secretary , Jack Straw , has said that military action against Iran would be "" inconceivable "" .
Margaret Beckett , his successor , has also insisted that no one is planning action against Tehran .
Today 's report , entitled "" Time to Talk :
The Case for Diplomatic Solutions on Iran "" , comes from the Foreign Policy Centre , backed by trade unions , Muslim and Christian groups and Oxfam .
It says that the UK could prove the vital catalyst between the EU and US on reopening talks with Iran .
Launching the document , Sir Richard Dalton , the British ambassador to Iran until last year , said that a pre - emptive strike on Iran would be "" a disaster for Iran , the region and quite possibly the world "" .
He said that patience and diplomacy were key to securing a successful outcome . ""
But both sides should work for a resumption .
It is vital that the US becomes fully involved in creative diplomacy , "" he told the BBC .
The former Labour minister Stephen Twigg , director of the Foreign Policy Centre , said : "" The consequences of military action against Iran are not only unpalatable , they are unthinkable . ""
Even according to the worst estimates , Iran is still years away from having a nuclear weapon . ""
Last May the Iranian president wrote an open letter to US president , George Bush , offering talks , but this was rejected .
In recent weeks Mr Bush has accused Iran , in addition to its nuclear ambitions , of supporting the insurgency in neighbouring Iraq .
But another former Labour MP , who is now chief executive of the British - Israel Communications and Research Centre , warned that time was running out to stop Iran become a nuclear power .
Lorna Fitzsimons told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme : "" What we are talking about here is Iran reaching the ability on an industrial scale to manufacture highly - enriched uranium . ""
IISS [ International Institute for Strategic Studies ] and many others prophesise that that is going to happen between nine to 11 months from today .
"" That is the watershed .
There is no return from that point .
You ca n't get the genie back in the bottle technologically once they have sorted out the problem they currently have with their centrifuges .
"" The Tories urged keeping all options "" on the table "" , while the Liberal Democrats welcomed the report 's call for new talks with Tehran .
The FPC report warns that military action could further destabilise the region and provoke retaliatory attacks against British forces in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It could also undermine the war on terror by fuelling anti - western sentiments , while strikes against nuclear facilities risk unleashing radioactive contamination . ""
Military action is not likely to be a short , sharp engagement but could have a profound effect on the region , with shock waves felt far beyond , "" the report says .
"" The UK government is well positioned to articulate objections to military action .
Military action against Iran would work against the interests of the UK . ""
The report says that Mr Blair is among several world leaders who are keeping military force on the table .
"" Opposition to military action is currently widespread , though key leaders ( notably Tony Blair and Angela Merkel [ the German chancellor ] ) have refused to rule it out , believing the threat to be an important negotiating tool , "" it says .
Separately , in an interview broadcast today with BBC Radio 1 , Mr Blair promised to retain an interest in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict "" in the years to come "" .
The prime minister has already pledged , in his conference speech last year , to devote much of his remaining time in office to the problem , but today appeared to go further , suggesting that he would work on the issue after leaving No 10 .
In the pre - recorded interview , Mr Blair said that world leaders were agreed that resolving the Israeli - Palestinian conflict was the single most important issue for world peace .
He added : "" Our obligation is to put forward a peace process that can work and try and take that forward . ""
And over the next few weeks I think there will be some real movement there . ""
Asked whether he will continue to work in the Middle East post - Downing Street , Mr Blair said : "" I will retain a huge interest in the peace process in Israel and Palestine in the years to come of course because it 's so important . ""
That 's the reason why I 've spent so long in my time in office [ concentrating on the Middle East ] and , incidentally , I am in the end optimistic that this thing can be done . ""
But it requires a lot of hard work , a lot of commitment and it requires the international community as a whole to recognise that there is no more important issue for us to resolve than Israel - Palestine . ""

2007-02-05,"These days , it 's hard to avoid President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's pronouncements on foreign policy .
But he also takes a keen interest in culture . ""
The art of theatre , "" he writes , in the programme for the 25th Fadjr international theatre festival in Tehran , "" should represent the best and most beautiful definitions of human truth - seeking and worthiness . ""
Well , there 's certainly a strong strain of truth - seeking in the theatre I see during a week 's visit to the Fadjr festival .
But the trip also affords a much more complex picture of the country than you 'd ever glean from Ahmadinejad , or indeed from Bush and Blair .
Set up in the years following the Islamic revolution , Iran 's theatre festival only recently went international , thanks in part to the liberalising influence of Ahmadinejad 's predecessor , President Khatami .
In 2003 , Dundee Rep became the first British company to visit the Islamic Republic , with a production of Shakespeare 's Winter 's Tale .
This year , the festival - which I attended under the auspices of the UK cultural exchange outfit Visiting Arts , who were leading a business strategies in the arts workshop - showcased drama from Germany , Russia and Turkey , alongside the usual programme of homegrown theatre .
The Iranian work ranged from the naturalistic to far - out abstraction to traditional Persian performance .
There were plays called Agony , Chaotic Bitter Play , Torment Symphony .
There were recurrent motifs of entrapment : flies caught in spider 's webs ; people tied up ; Icarus imprisoned , dreaming of flight .
Humour was in short supply .
This is partly because there is a tendency in Iran to see theatre as pure , serious - not a branch of the entertainment industry .
It 's also pragmatic : the funniest show I saw , Koroush Narimani 's adaptation of Jaroslav Hlasek 's Good Soldier Svejk , fell foul of the censors because it uses the character of an ex - Jewish Catholic priest to ridicule the mullahs .
Censorship is one of the major issues facing Iranian artists today .
The government - or its theatre arm , the Dramatic Arts Centre ( DAC ) - will not license any production that is critical of contemporary society .
I saw one play that painted a grim picture of military life during the Iran - Iraq war , but its staging was permitted only after the script had been changed , and the events relocated to a period before the revolution .
I spoke to two artists , Siamek Ehsaii and Amir Reza Koohestani , a playwright whose Amid the Clouds debuted at the Royal Court in 2005 .
Both feared their next works would be blocked because they feature , respectively , suicide and the true story of recent multiple murders in Tehran .
The more fundamental restrictions , however , are cultural rather than political . ""
In Iran , we have all these limitations on how we use the body , "" says the actress Sara Reyhani .
"" Before we even move , we have to censor ourselves . ""
Her interests , she says , "" are in contact improvisation and dance .
But we 're not allowed to touch one another , and we 're not allowed to dance . ""
Nor is she , or any other actress , allowed to remove her headscarf .
Reyhani currently has one arm in plaster , and she and director Arvand Dashtaray used this in a dance piece ( or , to dodge the censors , "" body theatre "" ) in which a man and a woman flirt with the idea of touching one another .
Eventually they do touch - but only through plaster .
Some young artists are extremely impatient with these taboos , taboos that also deter international companies from performing at the festival .
Other more established practitioners downplay the censorship issue .
"" You have rules in your country , and we have rules in our country , "" says Atila Pessyani , the veteran director whose poetic , dissident drama
The Mute
Who Was Dreamed played in Edinburgh in 2002 .
These rules are frequently bent , if not broken .
And many artists believe that restrictions inspire greater creativity .
"" We think about ways to show something indirectly , "" says Koohestani .
"" And indirect ways can be more artistic . ""
When I repeat this to Reyhani , the dancer , she rolls her eyes .
For most practitioners , the bigger problems are practical , not cultural .
Iran has too few theatres , and too little money .
"" It 's a real shame for a city of 12 million , "" says Mohammad Atebbai , the dynamic director of the DAC 's international wing .
"" But we have just the City Theatre in Tehran , and only two or three more theatres besides . ""
There is almost no private theatre funding , so the state dictates what fills those spaces .
From 600 applications , the DAC funds no more than 100 productions annually .
And if you do n't make that shortlist ?
"" Iran desperately needs a privatised , entrepreneurial theatre culture , "" believes Atebbai .
As a result , many Iranian artists have concluded that the only way to make theatre pay is by appealing to the international market .
This is a dysfunctional development , says Koohestani - not least because , having only recently been reconnected with world theatre after years of isolation , Iranian artists are ill - equipped to second - guess international tastes . ""
So you end up with not - what - Europe - wants and not - what - Iranian - audiences - want .
You lose both your audiences . ""
Theatres tend to be full in Tehran , but only because there are so few of them . ""
So artists do n't need to think about what people want , "" says Koohestani .
He would make tuning into the domestic audience and putting faith in them his top priority .
In fact , there is a popular theatre sector in Tehran - small , self - supporting , and "" all just cheap comedy "" , says Koohestani .
"" You know , they drop their trousers then : hahaha . ""
But the artists I met wanted nothing to do with this , seeing art and commerce as separate activities .
Many would rather follow in the footsteps of European experimentalists such as Jerzy Grotowski , Tadeusz Kantor , Peter Brook - all of whom visited the Shiraz Festival in the years before the revolution .
Which is fair enough - but in Tehran , as Koohestani points out : "" There are traffic jams constantly .
People work hard .
Who wants to come and see these plays ? ""
According to Atebbai , both money and ( although this is disputed ) the government 's will are in place to help build a thriving , independent domestic theatre .
Iranian theatre is not entirely beleaguered ; there are reasons to be optimistic .
Torn from its europeanised past into an uneasy theocratic present , braced for more change , Iran is a nuanced , more liberal place than one might expect .
The most distinguished of its playwrights and directors are already internationally renowned .
The winners of best play and best director at this year 's festival - Hamid Reza Azarang 's funny , poignant Iran - Iraq war drama , Fantasy on a Parallel Bar , and 26-year - old Homayoun Zadeh 's grungy spin on Daedalus and Icarus - will surely follow suit .
( Both the Manchester International Festival and Edinburgh 's Theatre Workshop are currently planning Iranian seasons . )
These are plays that deny , and will resonate far beyond , the pious , purist Iran of Ahmadinejad 's - or Bush 's - imagination . ""
Fortunately , "" says Mohammad Atebbai , "" culture is different from politics .
And from a cultural perspective , I see two sides , both international and Iranian , eager for more dialogue .
"" That 's what I saw , too , in all those overflowing auditoriums where bright - eyed youngsters squeezed two to a seat , squatted in the aisles , crowded by the doorways , to hear what homegrown and international artists had to say .
Seventy per cent of Iran 's population is under 30 , Atebbai reminds me . ""
And this generation will be different from the previous one .
They are not patient .
They wish to reach out to their desires and to do so quickly - like everyone else in the world .
They will play an important role , I believe .
Very soon we 'll see changes in all fields "" ."
2007-02-12,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , today accused the US of seeking to blame others for its problems in Iraq .
In an interview with the US TV network , ABC , Mr Ahmadinejad did not address directly American charges that Iran was supplying Iraqi insurgents with sophisticated explosive devices but claimed the White House was simply trying to save face over bad decisions in Iraq .
"" I think that Americans have made a mistake in Iraq and unfortunately are losing , "" Mr Ahmadinejad said , "" ... and that 's why they are trying to point their fingers to other people and pointing fingers to others will not solve the problem . ""
The US and Iran , who have had not had diplomatic relations since the US embassy siege in Tehran in 1979 , have been locked in a war of words in recent weeks .
As Washington and Tehran traded accusations , several bombs went off in crowded markets in Baghdad killing at least 76 people , the latest in a spate of particularly bloody atrocities .
Britain today weighed into the issue of alleged Iranian support for the insurgency by backing US claims of Iran 's complicity at the highest level with insurgent attacks on American and allied forces that have left 170 soldiers dead . ""
The prime minister has been at the cutting edge of identifying this problem , "" Tony Blair 's office said .
"" We continue to say what actually is the case , which is that we keep finding this weaponry which we do not believe can be sourced from anywhere else . ""
Mr Blair first expressed concern in October 2005 about technology for roadside bombs and other weapons entering Iraq from Iran , the prime minister 's official spokesman said .
Pressed on the accusation of Iranian involvement , Mr Ahmadinejad said peace and security would return to Iraq only when foreign forces leave .
"" We shy away from any kind of conflict and any kind of bloodshed , "" he said .
"" We are opposed to any kind of conflict and also the presence of foreign forces in Iraq and that 's why we are opposed to the presence of Americans . ""
Iran also says it is hardly surprising Iranian weapons are in Iraq as the two countries fought between 1980 and 1988 , and that Tehran had armed militia groups fighting Saddam Hussein .
Democratic party officials in the US have also reacted with scepticism at the accusations , amid fears that the Bush administration is building up a case for attacking Iran .
Democratic opposition is set to crystalise in a resolution in the House of Representatives opposing Mr Bush 's troop "" surge "" .
"" The administration is engaged in a drumbeat with Iran that is much like the drumbeat that they did with Iraq .
We 're going to insist on accountability , "" said Ron Wyden , a member on the Senate intelligence committee .
The US has been steadily increasing pressure on Iran in recent weeks .
A second aircraft carrier is scheduled to arrive in the gulf within the next few days and Mr Bush has authorised US forces to kill or capture Iranians thought to be helping Iraqi insurgents .
In a separate development , EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels moved ahead with plans to implement UN sanctions against Iran for its refusal to halt uranium enrichment .
Mohamed ElBaradei , head of the international atomic energy agency , the UN nuclear watchdog , repeated his appeal for a "" time out "" if Tehran suspends enrichment . ""
The two parties need to take a time out , "" he told reporters after meeting the Belgian prime minister , Guy Verhofstadt .
The EU decision follows agreement by the UN security council in December to impose sanctions targeting officials and programmes linked to Iran 's nuclear programme , amid western suspicions that Iran wants to build a nuclear bomb ."
2007-02-13,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , yesterday shrugged off the threat of a US attack and said accusations that Tehran was arming insurgents in Iraq represented an attempt to find a scapegoat for American "" defeats and failures "" .
The British government , however , backed Washington 's claims of covert Iranian arms supplies to insurgents , including sophisticated armour - piercing roadside bombs .
A Downing Street spokesman said Tony Blair had been "" at the cutting edge of identifying this problem "" , first raising the alarm over the alleged influx of Iranian weaponry in October 2005 .
The row over Iraq has added to growing tension over Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
A UN deadline for Iran to stop uranium enrichment is due to pass next Wednesday , amid simmering speculation that the US is contemplating taking military action against Tehran 's nuclear programme .
Mr Ahmadinejad brushed aside the threat .
In an interview with America 's ABC News , he said : "" Why should we be afraid ?
First , the possibility is very low , and we think that there are wise people in the US that would stop such illegal actions .
But our position is clear - our nation has made it clear that anyone who wants to attack our country will be severely punished . ""
The Iranian president said his government and Iran 's revolutionary guards were "" opposed to any kind of conflict in Iraq "" , and he dismissed evidence presented by American military officials at the weekend pointing towards a covert revolutionary guard role behind the insurgency and the sectarian violence in Iraq .
"" You are showing us some piece of papers and you call them documents , "" he said .
"" There should be a court to prove the case .
We think that the US is following another policy , trying to hide its defeats and failures , and that 's why it is pointing its fingers at others . ""
Tony Snow , the White House press spokesman , yesterday stood by the allegations by US military intelligence , but denied that they were intended to pave the way for an attack .
He said they simply presented "" evidence to the effect that there 's been the shipment of weaponry , lethal weaponry , into Iraq , some of it of Iranian provenance .
And this is something that we think if the president of Iran wants to put a stop to it , we wish him luck and hope he 'll do it real soon . ""
However , Democratic Congressmen expressed scepticism about the timing of the allegations , noting parallels to the build up to the Iraq invasion .
The House of Representatives is due to begin today debating a resolution critical of the Bush administration 's handling of the Iraq conflict , as the Democratic majority flexes its new political muscles .
In Europe , Iran 's chief negotiator , Ari Larijani , kept up a flurry of diplomacy ahead of next week 's UN deadline , holding talks with the Swiss government after weekend discussions with European Union officials .
He said his country did not want atomic weapons , because it would trigger a Middle East nuclear arms race and would contribute nothing to solving the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
He told the German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung that Iran was willing to give "" all imaginable guarantees "" that it was not developing weapons , but he insisted it would not abandon uranium enrichment as a precondition to negotiations .
Javier Solana , the EU 's top foreign policy official , met Mr Larijani in Munich , but conceded yesterday that the prospects for a diplomatic breakthrough were "" not immense "" .
European foreign ministers meanwhile agreed on the implementation of limited sanctions ordered by the UN security council in December .
Iran insists it has the right to enrich uranium for civil power generation , but the US and its allies suspect it of secretly planning to develop nuclear weapons .
The UN watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency , has criticised Tehran for failing to disclose all the elements of its programme , and last Friday the IAEA halved its assistance programme to Iran .
The IAEA director general , Mohamed ElBaradei , is due to report to the security council on Iranian compliance next week .
Yesterday he welcomed Tehran 's stated willingness to negotiate , but added that nothing short of "" full transparency "" would lead to a resumption of substantive talks ."
2007-02-16,"The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Thursday February 22 2007 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , president of Iran , has not "" called for Israel to be wiped off the map "" .
The Farsi phrase he employed is correctly translated as "" this regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time "" .
He was quoting a statement by Iran 's first Islamist leader , the late Ayatollah Khomeini .
A German neo - Nazi publisher was yesterday sentenced to five years in prison for inciting racial hatred and denying that the Nazis murdered six million Jews .
Ernst Zündel , who was extradited from Canada to face trial in Germany in 2005 , received the maximum sentence available for the crime of Holocaust denial after being found guilty on 14 counts .
The prosecutor , Andreas Grossmann , said Zündel 's claim that the Holocaust never happened earned him the title of "" political conman "" and that his views were dangerous to Germans .
"" You might as well argue that the sun rises in the west , but you can not change that the Holocaust has been proven , "" he said , referring to Zündel 's work
Did Six Million Really Die ?
The prosecution accused him of using "" pseudo - scientific methods "" in an attempt to overturn the accepted facts on the Holocaust .
But campaigners for Zündel , 67 , said he was a peaceful advocate of the right to free speech who was being denied that right .
His supporters filled the courtroom .
At the close of the trial Zündel - who also wrote The Hitler We Loved and Why , and has described Hitler as "" a decent and very peaceful man "" - asked the court in Mannheim to set up an international commission of historians to explore the Holocaust .
He said he wanted "" hard facts "" and not just witness statements , and that if the commission could prove Jews were gassed he would "" hold a press conference at which I would publicly apologise to Jews , Israelis and the world "" .
Calling Zündel a "" dangerous agitator , a rabble - rouser and haranguer "" and an "" admirer of Adolf Hitler "" with a "" deep hate towards everything Jewish "" , the judge , Ulrich Meinerzhagen , said he was handing down the harshest possible sentence because the state had "" the right and the duty to protect the basic principles of the law "" .
Zündel , who emigrated to Canada in 1958 but was deemed a security threat by the time of his deportation in 2005 , had repeated his claims in various publications and on his website .
He spent two years in custody in Canada before his extradition to Germany .
The trial was stopped in November 2005 and resumed three months later after the judge complained that Zündel 's defence lawyers were deliberately and unnecessarily trying to prolong it .
One lawyer was subsequently excluded from the trial for signing her correspondence to Zündel with "" Heil Hitler "" , while another was warned he faced prosecution for quoting from Adolf Hitler 's Mein Kampf in his address to the court .
Zündel 's yearlong trial has turned him into something of a hero among Holocaust deniers in the Arab world .
Posters of him appeared at a conference in Tehran last year organised by the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who as well as denying the Holocaust has called for Israel to be wiped off the map .
Germany , which holds the six - month presidency of the EU , is trying to outlaw Holocaust denial and to ban swastikas across member countries .
But the proposal is expected to cause heated debate over freedom of speech .
Ten European countries and Israel already have laws against Holocaust denial ."
2007-02-19,"An Iranian website fiercely critical of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been shut down in an apparent fresh crackdown on anti - government dissent on the internet .
Baztab , a fundamentalist site that has previously accused Mr Ahmadinejad of betraying the Islamic revolution by attending a female dance show , has been closed for acting against the constitution and undermining national unity .
The order coincided with the confirmation of Gholamhossein Elham , who has voiced support for legal restraints on press freedom , as Iran 's new minister of justice .
Mr Elham , previously the government 's official spokesman , last year urged prosecutors to pursue news outlets that printed "" lies "" about Mr Ahmadinejad 's government .
His appointment came as the government disclosed new measures to monitor and restrict unofficial news websites .
Baztab - which is linked to Mohsen Rezai , a former revolutionary guard commander - is one of Iran 's most widely read political sites .
It has been a staunch critic of the government 's economic policies , which have produced surging inflation and high unemployment .
The website also posted video footage purportedly showing Mr Ahmadinejad watching a female dance performance at the recent Asian Games in Qatar , in breach of Iran 's Islamic prohibition on women dancing in front of men .
In a statement , the culture and Islamic guidance ministry , controlled by Mr Ahmadinejad 's government , said : "" Considering the large amount of such material , [ Baztab ] was recognised as an illegitimate internet site and its continued activity is illegal and banned .
"" Access to the site is now blocked on most Iranian internet service providers .
Baztab has denounced the ban as illegal and pledged to fight it .
Foad Sadeghi , a member of its policy board , said : "" The government is acting as complainant , prosecutor , judge and executioner .
The order violates eight principles of the constitution and restricts the media 's freedom of expression , which does not serve the people in the current sensitive situation .
"" Baztab is one of several sites to criticise Mr Ahmadinejad 's policies recently , including blaming his approach to Iran 's nuclear programme for bringing the country closer to confrontation with the west ."
2007-02-20,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , today rejected international demands for his country to suspend its uranium enrichment programme as a UN deadline to do so approached .
The UN security council has said Iran must cease its work on enrichment - a process in the manufacture of both nuclear fuel and material for nuclear weapons - by tomorrow or face further economic sanctions .
Tehran said that it wanted to resume negotiations over its nuclear ambitions , but Mr Ahmadinejad refused to stop its enrichment programme unless western countries did so too .
He told a crowd of thousands in northern Iran : "" Justice demands that those who want to hold talks with us shut down their nuclear fuel cycle programme too .
Then , we can hold dialogue under a fair atmosphere . ""
The US brushed Mr Ahmadinejad 's suggestion aside .
Reuters said the White House spokesman Tony Snow asked reporters : "" Do you believe that 's a serious offer ? ""
On December 23 2006 the security council agreed to impose limited sanctions against Iran and gave the country 60 days to halt enrichment or face additional measures .
The UN 's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , is to report on the state of Iran 's nuclear programme tomorrow and is expected to say Iran has defied the deadline .
The IAEA chief , Mohamed ElBaradei , met Iran 's chief nuclear negotiator , Ali Larijani , today in Vienna .
Speaking after the meeting , Mr Larijani warned the US against escalating the situation .
"" If they ... move into the boxing ring , they would have problems .
But if they sit at the chess table , then both sides would come to a result , "" he said .
"" Anybody interested in ... irrational moves ... would definitely receive an appropriate response . ""
While saying his country was prepared to deliver "" assurances that there would be no deviation ... toward a nuclear weapons programme "" , he offered no new suggestions .
He said the key demand for Tehran to suspend enrichment was just a "" pretext "" to put political pressure on his country .
In an interview published today in the Financial Times , Mr ElBaradei said Iran could be as little as six months away from being able to enrich uranium on an industrial scale and that he did not expect Tehran to meet tomorrow 's deadline .
The US and several of its western allies believe Iran is using its nuclear programme to produce an atomic weapon , but Tehran says its aim is to generate electricity .
Mr ElBaradei said in the FT interview that , according to US and British intelligence , Iran was still years away from developing a nuclear weapon .
But speculation has been growing that the US is drawing up contingency plans for an air strike against Iran 's nuclear programme , despite repeated public denials by the Bush administration .
Last night , the BBC reported that a list of targets had been compiled and that air strikes would be triggered if US intelligence assessed that Tehran posed a "" perceived nuclear threat "" to the US or Iran was linked to a major attack on American forces in Iraq .
The US has put further pressure on Iran by sending a second aircraft carrier to the Gulf region .
The John C Stennis and warships in its group arrived in the area yesterday ."

2007-02-21,"With Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , seemingly set on defying a UN ultimatum to end uranium enrichment , one question looms : what happens next ?
Sanctions ?
Or another US - led war ?
As ever with these things , bloggers ' reactions to such prospects vary wildly .
The self - explanatory Moderate Voice site believes any US military action against Iran would be a disaster : "" Iran does not have enough experience as a modern state to live through a US military onslaught and re - emerge as a unified and strong law - abiding democracy .
The likelier outcome is prolonged internal civil war ...
Such outcomes of lengthy political and military instability would amount to a debilitating new world war for Americans and Europeans .
"" Tehran - born , Toronto - based Hossein Derakhshan , who blogs under the name
Hoder , goes further : "" I 've written before and I repeat it here .
If the US attacked Iran , despite all my problems with the Islamic Republic , I 'd go back and fight these bastards . ""
One reader in the comments responded thus : "" Best pack your bags cause Bush / Cheney are going in .
They 've got Iran surrounded , why would they stop now ?
Plus , with a Democratic congress ready to pull the plug on their world domination party the writing 's on the wall , they 're about out of time .
"" In direct contrast , one US solider in Iraq , Boots on the Ground , writing just over a week ago when US allegations emerged that Iran was helping to supply Iraqi insurgents , was bullish .
"" What really gets me is Iran is doing some MAJOR miscalculating that the USA is weak and can not do anything .
So , they boldly support our enemies , think we are powerless to stop them .
Which could have HUGE consequences for Iran . ""
There has also been a rash of open letters to Mr Ahmadinejad from people concerned about a looming war .
US academic Walter Block , writing on libertarian - slanted site Lew Rockwell.com , offers some heartfelt advice which at times sounds unintentionally tongue - in - cheek : "" Surely , you have some sort of common ground with the present president of the US ?
Maybe a love of sports ?
Horseback riding ?
Love of your respective children ?
A belief in God ?
Appreciation of the beauty of sunsets ?
There must be something . ""
Another letter writer has a different target - the Iranian president 's own blog , and more pertinently why he has not been updating it .
AJS complains he is a regular visitor to the blog , but it was last updated on December 21 .
His letter reads : This is my plea to you old Mahmoud , I like you , your [ sic ] my kind of guy , always feeding BS to the media and portraying your crazy ideas as some how mainstream and ignoring any and all dissent , that is exactly how I would handle myself in your position .
And on top of that we are both civil engineers content with the simple things in life , another plus .
"" My main problem with you is that you do n't update your blog , of course the anti - Semitism does n't help either
but I 'll let that slide for now .
"" AJS ends with a threat at least as terrifying as that of US attack - to remove Mr Ahmadinejad 's blog from his list of links , replacing it with Rosie O'Donnell 's instead ."
2007-02-24,"Iranian MPs have demanded an apology from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad after teachers were given government - sponsored tests deemed "" insulting "" to the prophet Muhammad .
The exam - sat by teachers seeking promotion - provoked outrage by posing questions which appeared to degrade Islam 's holiest figure by alluding to personal habits and proclivities .
Most of the 40 multiple - choice questions have been judged so mocking that Iran 's state - controlled media has refrained from publishing them .
One less offensive question , reproduced by local newspapers and websites , lists four choices when asking how Muhammad compared himself with the prophet Joseph .
They are : "" A )
I am more beautiful than Joseph ; B ) Joseph is more beautiful than me ; C )
I am cuter than Joseph ;
D ) Joseph is more beautiful than me
but I am cuter than him .
"" Others refer to his hair and beard colour .
The national teachers ' representative body protested after the test was given to diploma and higher - diploma level teachers in Tehran province .
The local education authority admitted the questions were "" in bad taste "" and withdrew them .
An alternative exam is being drawn up for teachers who failed , although the results of those with pass marks have been declared valid .
Some MPs branded the incident a deliberate plot to undermine Iran 's Islamic system and likened it to last year 's row over Danish cartoons satirising Muhammad , which provoked outrage throughout the Muslim world after they were published in several European newspapers .
"" What is the difference between these questions and the caricatures drawn in Denmark against the prophet ? "" said Emad Afrough , the fundamentalist head of the cultural committee in Iran 's parliament .
The latest row has spurred parliamentarians to begin preparations for impeaching the education minister , Mahmoud Farshidi , who has apologised for the tests .
However , MPs have dismissed his mea culpa as insufficient and have called on Mr Ahmadinejad to apologise on the government 's behalf .
The president has declined to comment directly but said in a speech this week in the northern province of Gilan : "" The unity , authority and dignity of the Iranian nation stems from sticking to the dignified presence of the dear prophet of Islam , Muhammad .
"" Teachers were given 30 hours off classroom duties to study a biography of the prophet by the late Ayatollah Muhammad Tabatabai , a Shia philosopher whose teachings inspired many senior figures in Iran 's Islamic revolutionary movement .
Its strong focus on personal characteristics - including hygiene , physical appearance and eating habits - was the subject of staffroom gossip and jokes .
"" Some teachers were even exchanging notes on the book 's content in text messages , "" one teacher told the newspaper Etemade Melli .

2007-02-25,"Tensions were rising between Iran and the West this weekend as Britain prepares to push for tough new UN sanctions against Tehran over its nuclear enrichment programme .
Talks in New York this week aimed at agreeing the text of a UN resolution follow a weekend of tough verbal exchanges that began with a reaffirmation by US Vice - President , Dick Cheney , that Washington is leaving open ' all options ' , including military action , in its efforts to rein in Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
A response to Cheney 's warning - hours after a defiant speech by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad defending his nuclear projects - came from Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki who said the US was not in a position to take military action . '
We do not see America in a position to impose another crisis on its taxpayers by starting another war in the region , ' Mottaki said in a press conference with Bahrain 's visiting foreign minister . '
The only way to reach a solution for disputes is negotiations and talks .
Therefore , we want the London meeting to make a brave decision and resume talks with Iran . '
Bill Richardson , US governor of New Mexico and a 2008 presidential candidate , yesterday urged the Bush administration to negotiate directly with Iran . '
Sabre - rattling is not a good way to get the Iranians to cooperate , ' he said . '
But it is a good way to start a new war . '
Richardson , UN ambassador during the Clinton administration , said Iran would ' not end their nuclear program because we threaten them and call them names ' .
But Foreign Office sources in London were at pains to stress that Cheney had also reiterated that the West preferred a ' peaceful ' resolution to the nuclear dispute .
They said all current efforts by the US and the EU were focused on the diplomatic front .
A senior member of Israel 's intelligence establishment , meanwhile , told The Observer that suggestions that preparations were under way for possible Israeli military action against Iran were ' wrong ' .
He said his country wanted a diplomatic solution but added that there was deep concern over the situation .
He said Israel remained deeply sceptical of suggestions that Ahmadinejad 's hardline nuclear policy was being eroded by outside diplomatic pressure .
Foreign Office sources took a more bullish view , saying they had been encouraged by ' a number of visible signs ' in recent weeks of internal criticism of Ahmadinejad and that ' his standing is diminishing ' .
The key now , according to an FO official involved in the Iran issue , was to ' ratchet up the pressure ' by getting the toughest possible new UN resolution capable of winning not only American and EU support but that of a more sceptical Russia and China as well . '
There must be a united front , so that the Iranians understand we are sending a clear message , ' a source said .
The International Atomic Energy Agency formally reported back to the UN last week that Iran had flouted the Security Council 's 60-day deadline to freeze its enrichment programme and thus allay international concerns that it is developing a nuclear weapon .
Instead , it had expanded the programme by setting up hundreds of centrifuges .
Ahmadinejad responded to the report by saying that it was irrelevant whether foreign powers believed Iran 's repeated insistence that its nuclear activities were peaceful .
He said Iran would resist ' all bullies ' and go ahead with the programme ."
2007-02-25,"Every week seems to bring a new "" crisis "" between Iran and the west , even if some seem more confected than real .
But last week 's report by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) was both credible and worrying .
The IAEA reported that Tehran was installing centrifuges for uranium enrichment more quickly than had been previously estimated , that the government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had still not agreed to "" transparency measures "" with the inspectors , and that the amount of uranium being enriched was also on the rise .
The sober nature of the IAEA report was particularly striking because of the contrast it posed to some of the more recent , feverish claims made by the Bush administration .
To take the latest example : On February 11 , anonymous US military analysts in Baghdad briefed reporters , telling them that orders for Iran 's elite Quds Force , allegedly operating inside Iraq , were "" coming from the highest levels of the Iranian government "" .
And then the very next day , none other than General Peter Pace , the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , poured cold water on that idea , saying "" I would not say by what I know that the Iranian government clearly knows or is complicit . ""
The White House spent days trying to clean up the resultant mess .
At one point , pressed by reporters as to whether the administration was using shady intelligence as the basis for a "" warning "" to Iran , President George W Bush 's official spokesman Tony Snow could only exclaim , "" No , no , no , no .
I 'm almost ready to hit my head on the microphone .
"" The administration has been sending out mixed messages towards Iran at a dizzying speed since the start of the year .
On January 31 , Bush told The Wall Street Journal that his administration had "" made it clear to the Iranians that if we catch them moving weapons [ in Iraq ] , they 'll be dealt with . ""
And Bush has , of course , ordered another aircraft carrier group to the region .
In a move that has been less widely discussed , he has also announced plans to double the size of America 's Strategic Petroleum Reserve - a decision which those of a gloomy disposition see as an early attempt to offset the possible consequences of a conflict with Iran .
True , the president and his most senior aides have repeatedly asserted that they have "" no intent upon going into Iran "" ( as Bush told National Public Radio last month ) and are "" not planning a war with Iran "" ( as Defence Secretary Robert Gates said last Saturday ) .
But the White House can hardly complain such are parsed by sceptics on the lookout for any semantic sleight of hand .
As Gary Younge pointed out in Monday 's Guardian , Bush 's remarks on Iran echo similar comments , made in 2002 and later shown to be mendacious , about plans to attack Iraq .
The sentiment is widely shared .
As an editorial in last week 's edition of the left - wing magazine the Nation asserted : "" What is surprising is not that Vice President Cheney and his neoconservative cronies want to expand a war that should never have been waged in the first place .
It is that they seem to be getting away with it . ""
Fair enough .
But there is also another side to the story .
Opposition to the Bush administration should not topple over into excessive benevolence about Iran in general or the Ahmadinejad presidency in particular .
In yesterday 's Guardian , the Iranian ambassador in London proudly proclaimed that his country is "" the region 's largest democracy "" and added that "" Iran 's national security doctrine is defensive "" .
That seems an odd description of a nation whose president has made clear his desire to wipe another country off the face of the map .
And while Iran is more democratic than many other nations in the Middle East , that 's not saying much .
It remains , at base , a theocracy .
Yes , it is possible that Iran is merely enriching uranium for energy , as it claims .
And it is also possible that it could be seeking nuclear weapons , but purely for deterrent purposes .
If Western governments adopted either of those interpretations as guiding principles , however , they would be guilty of reckless naivety .
It should be perfectly possible , even for those who detest the Bush administration , to accept that the world would be a worse , more perilous place if Iran were to possess nuclear weapons .
The question then , is how to stop the development of those weapons .
Here , the White House 's belligerence may ultimately prove self - defeating - or , worse , provoke a conflict that neither side wants .
On Tuesday , I spoke to Hans Blix , the man who once led the UN weapons inspection teams in Iraq .
The Bush administration , he warned , "" is playing at very high stakes .
The risk is that a spark could fly . ""
He also asserted that "" the Iranians are clearly divided .
But if the country was to be attacked from abroad , I think you would very quickly see a return of nationalistic fervour . ""
( The full interview with Blix was published in Wednesday 's New York Observer . )
If there is danger in bellicosity toward Iran , diplomacy offers real hope .
The limited sanctions imposed by the United Nations in December seem to be having some effect .
Ahmadinejad 's domestic popularity is already suffering , as the recent municipal elections showed , largely because of his failure to deliver economic progress .
Allies of the former president Hashemi Rafsanjani earlier this year explicitly linked Ahmadinejad 's "" continued aggression ... with the world powers "" to "" the pressure on Iran 's economy "" .
Furthermore , as Hans Blix and many others acknowledge , the West has time on its side with Iran .
Most intelligence estimates suggest Iran is five to ten years from possessing a nuclear weapon .
The drums of war in Washington may be growing louder , and the US will press for further sanctions on Iran in the wake of the IAEA report .
But we should also hope that , for once , the administration gives diplomacy the attention it deserves .
We should also hope that its efforts prevail ."
2007-02-26,"Iran declared yesterday that it was ready "" even for war "" and that its nuclear programme was irreversible , as it launched a rocket believed to have reached the edge of orbit .
Reaction to the launch of what was described initially by state media as a space rocket , but later only as an experimental sub - orbital device , reflected nervousness about the stand - off .
The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , insisted his country 's nuclear fuel programme had "" no reverse gear "" .
In response , the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , said : "" They do n't need a reverse gear .
They need a stop button . ""
The exchange followed last week 's finding that Iran had failed to meet a UN deadline to halt uranium enrichment .
Tehran insists its nuclear programme is to generate electricity , not build weapons .
Representatives of the five permanent UN security council members and Germany are due to meet in London today to examine new sanctions that could include freezing European export credits and restrictions on arms exports to Iran .
Tehran appeared to step up its rhetoric over the weekend .
"" Iran has obtained the technology to produce nuclear fuel and Iran 's move is like a train ... which has no brake and no reverse gear , "" the ISNA news agency quoted Mr Ahmadinejad as saying .
Referring to gas centrifuges used to enrich uranium , he said : "" The westerners are not concerned about the existence and activity of ... centrifuges in Iran .
They are concerned about the collapse of their hegemony and hollow power . ""
Manouchehr Mohammadi , a deputy foreign minister , went further , saying : "" We have prepared ourselves for any situation , even for war . ""
Iranian military commanders have said that recent war games , the latest of which involved testing several missiles , show the country 's readiness to defend itself .
Iran 's chief nuclear negotiator , Ali Larijani , was more measured , talking of reacting "" proportionately "" to any further pressure .
"" Iran is ready to resolve existing differences over its nuclear programme through fruitful and careful negotiations , "" he said in South Africa , urging security council members not to continue their "" hostile behaviour "" .
UN sanctions were imposed on Iran in December barring the transfer of technology and know - how to the country 's nuclear and missile programme .
Further measures were threatened if enrichment did not end by last week , a deadline the International Atomic Energy Agency certified had not been met .
Ms Rice said there was evidence the sanctions were working .
"" People in Iran are concerned about the fact that financial institutions are moving out ... and refusing to deal with Iran , "" she told Fox News .
"" They 're concerned that their oil and gas fields need investment that they 're probably not going to be able to get . ""
If Iran were to stop enrichment and reprocessing activities , she said , "" we can sit down and talk about whatever is on Iran 's mind "" .
The US has said it wants a diplomatic solution but will not rule out military action .
Britain 's stance is similar , though there is less emphasis on force , even as a last resort .
Dick Cheney , the US vice - president , said that it would be a "" serious mistake "" to allow Iran to become a nuclear power .
He endorsed comments by the Senator John McCain that the only thing worse than a military confrontation with Iran would be a nuclear - armed Iran .
Britain will be represented at today 's talks by the Foreign Office political director , John Sawers .
Diplomats say he is likely to push for new punitive measures , though these would have to be approved by ministers .
Russia and China , which have strong commercial links to Tehran , have refused to back a travel ban and other tougher action .
Foreign ministers from seven Muslim states meeting in Pakistan , meanwhile , called for a diplomatic solution to the "" dangerous "" stand - off .
"" It is vital that all issues must be resolved through diplomacy and there must be no resort to use of force , "" said a statement issued jointly by Egypt , Indonesia , Jordan , Malaysia , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia and Turkey .
Iranian officials last night denied state media reports that the rocket had reached space , which would have meant a huge advance in its missile programme .
Tehran said it was a sub - orbital research rocket .
The rocket may be related to efforts to launch satellites - Iran launched its first in a joint project with Russia two years ago ."
2007-02-27,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , came under fire from domestic critics yesterday for his uncompromising stance on the nuclear issue as the US and Britain launched a new diplomatic effort to agree harsher UN sanctions they hope will force Tehran to halt uranium enrichment .
Mohammad Atrianfar , a respected political commentator , accused the president of using "" the language of the bazaar "" and said his comments had made it harder for Ali Larijani , the country 's top nuclear negotiator , to reach a compromise with European diplomats .
The president made global headlines at the weekend by declaring that his country 's quest for nuclear energy was an unstoppable train , adding to the sense of crisis as emergency talks got under way in London yesterday .
Critics from across the Iranian political spectrum took him to task for his "" no brakes or reverse gear "" remarks , bolstering claims in the west that his hardline position may be starting to backfire . ""
This rhetoric is not suitable for a president and has no place in diplomatic circles , "" said Mr Atrianfar , a confidant of Hashemi Rafsanjani , an influential regime insider and rival of Mr Ahmadinejad .
"" It is the language people in the bazaar and alleyways use to address the simplest issues of life . ""
Fayaz Zahed , leader of the pro - reform Islamic Iran Solidarity party , criticised the president for seeking to emulate the populist Venezuelan president , Hugo Chavez , rather than internationally revered leaders such as Nelson Mandela or Vaclav Havel . ""
The brake exists to get the train safely to its destination , "" Mr Zahed wrote in the newspaper Etemad - e Melli . ""
Perhaps on the journey , we might find the track broken and are obliged to move our passengers by using the reverse gear to get to a safer track .
Iran is a nation of earthquakes , flood and national disasters !

Neither weakness nor inexperience and unnecessary rhetorical aggression is acceptable in our foreign policy , "" it said .
In London , the Foreign Office 's political director , John Sawers , was talking to colleagues from the US , France , Russia , China - the other four permanent members of the UN security council - and Germany , holder of the EU 's rotating presidency .
The meeting was described as "" a productive first session "" by the Foreign Office .
The US and Britain are pushing for tougher financial and trade sanctions on Iran but will have to work hard to overcome objections from Russia and China before they can be codified into a new UN resolution .
The US representative , Nicholas Burns , the undersecretary of state , has been stressing Washington 's commitment to diplomacy to resolve the crisis , in contrast to the continuing refusal of the White House to rule out military action .
Sergei Lavrov , the Russian foreign minister , underlined Moscow 's unease when he criticised the US for talk of using force . ""
Forecasts and suggestions about a strike on Iran have become more frequent and this is worrying , "" he was quoted as telling President Vladimir Putin .
A UN resolution in December barred the transfer of technology and know - how to Iran 's nuclear and missile programme .
New measures could include travel bans and asset freezes on individuals and organisations involved in them .
Trade sanctions , including a ban on EU export credits , would be harder to agree .
The foreign secretary , Margaret Beckett , said Iran was treading a "" dangerous route "" but the west still wanted to negotiate .
"" The steps that we have taken are reversible .
There is nothing that we would like better than to be able to reverse them and no longer to have to continue with sanctions , "" she said in Islamabad ."
2007-03-01,"Students involved in an angry protest against the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , have been expelled and earmarked for compulsory military service , in an apparent act of official retribution .
Authorities at Tehran 's Amir Kabir University , a traditional hotbed of student protest , have ended the studies of 54 students , ostensibly for repeatedly failing their exams .
However , most of the students singled out are political activists who took part in December 's demonstration at the university at which president Ahmadinejad was greeted with chants of "" death to the dictator "" .
Many students with equally poor academic records have been allowed to continue , activists said .
The demonstration , which sparked violent clashes between protesters and Basij volunteers loyal to the president , was triggered by student anger over a campus clampdown by the government .
One activist displayed a banner reading : "" Fascist president , the polytechnic is not for you . ""
Others held portraits of Mr Ahmadinejad upside down and set them alight .
One student had his nose broken by a cabinet minister 's aide and a member of Mr Ahmadinejad 's security team fired a stun grenade to disperse demonstrators .
Several protesters later went into hiding , fearing for their lives after being threatened by the president 's supporters .
Mr Ahmadinejad later announced that the dissenting students should go unpunished .
Ali Azizi , vice - secretary of the Islamic Students Committee , said the wave of expulsions broke that pledge .
"" Many of the expelled students are political activists and were present at the protests ...
It demonstrates revenge against the students ' protests ...
In the past , questions over academic performance have not [ been ] considered reason for expulsion .
Students with even worse academic records exist among student organisations supported by the government but they have not faced expulsion .
"" The university chancellor , Ali Reza Rahai , an ally of Mr Ahmadinejad , accompanied the expulsion orders by signing eligibility notices allowing the students to be enlisted into the armed forces .
That effectively makes good a threat by Mr Ahmadinejad that he would arrange for students with three stars under the university 's disciplinary code to be enrolled as army sergeants .
This system has been extensively used to punish those involved in political activities on campus .
The protest against Mr Ahmadinejad was also related to moves to segregate female and male students , the closure of campus magazines and the demolition of buildings belonging to the students committee .

2007-03-06,"Reports suggesting Iran has sought Saudi help in mediating its nuclear and other disputes with the Bush administration are wide of the mark .
When the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , travelled to Riyadh at the weekend , he had a wholly different object in view : wrecking the ostensibly anti - Iranian coalition of "" moderate "" Arab states plus Israel , painstakingly assembled by the Americans in recent months .
The summit with Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah marked Iran 's most successful effort yet to break out of its made - in - Washington diplomatic straitjacket .
As if to calm fears of a growing , region - wide Sunni - Shia divide , the two leaders made an ostentatious show of amity , holding hands and posing for cameras .
Referring to inter - communal violence in Iraq , which Washington says Shia Iran is deliberately fomenting , the King and his guest jointly pledged "" to stop any attempt aimed at spreading sectarian strife in the region "" which they described as "" the greatest threat against the Muslim nation "" .
Both leaders expressed support for unity and equality in Iraq .
This is a wild departure from the script promoted by US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice during recent visits .
On her reading , Saudi Arabia , Jordan , Egypt , Israel and the Gulf states face a common threat from a newly assertive , potentially nuclear - armed Iran , backed by Syria .
The grand bargain devised in Washington has been plain for some time : in return for Arab support in isolating Iran and their forbearance over Iraq , the US has offered enhanced military protection and a revived Arab - Israeli peace process .
The White House meanwhile has quietly swallowed its rhetoric about advancing Arab democratic reform .
Iran is now plunging a determined spanner into these delicate works by apparently patching things up with the House of Saud , Washington 's foremost Arab ally .
And the policy may be bearing fruit .
Hopes are rising in Lebanon that the tense stand - off between Iranian - backed Hizbullah and the Saudi - backed Sunni - led government will soon be defused .
Opposition leader Nabih Berri said this week that "" the chances of success this time are greater than at any previous time "" .
Hizbullah sources were quoted saying the Riyadh summit was directly responsible for the thaw .
Iran and Saudi Arabia even seem to be finding some common ground on Palestine and Hamas , the ruling Sunni Muslim faction ostracised by the west but funded , and according to Israeli intelligence , trained and armed by Iran .
Anxious to curb Tehran 's influence in an area where it seeks to lead , Riyadh mediated a national unity deal last month between Hamas and the less militant Fatah of President Mahmoud Abbas .
The agreement ended fighting between rival Palestinians .
But it also undercut Washington 's insistence that Hamas recognise Israel and forswear violence .
And deliberately or otherwise , it torpedoed Ms Rice 's plans for Israeli - Palestinian peace talks .
She is still trying to rescue them .
At the same time the Saudis are planning to relaunch their 2002 land - for - peace initiative , over Israeli and US objections , at this month 's Arab League summit in Riyadh .
Although Tehran hardliners remain viscerally opposed to recognition of the "" Zionist entity "" , this also serves Iran 's aim of reducing American influence and building regional clout .
Having long urged Saudi Arabia to take a more active regional role , Washington has undoubtedly been startled by the way Riyadh appears to be defining its interests separately from those of the US .
But regional analysts are sceptical about the Iran connection , suggesting the rapprochement between the traditional rivals is superficial at best and the US has little to fear .
"" The Saudis are trying to play a diplomatic rather than a polemical role with Iran .
Their differences over Lebanon , for example , are still immense , "" said Dana Moss of the Transatlantic Institute in Brussels .
Riyadh was determined not to repeat the mistakes of the 1980s when it funded anti - Shia Wahhabi ideology and institutions that later turned on the kingdom . ""
The dangers of invoking anti - Shia sentiments are clear .
I 'm sure they 're doing this partly for their own internal calm and security , "" she said .
"" The only state Iran has to worry about in the region is Saudi Arabia .
It 's the only one that 's its equivalent in standing and prestige .
And Saudi Arabia is still trying to contain Iran .
This time the approach is different but the nature of the threat has not changed . """
2007-03-06,"The Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's eight - hour trip to Riyadh on Saturday to meet King Abdullah marked an important milestone in the relations between their countries , which in the past have oscillated between competition and cooperation .
After their talks , centred round Iraq , Lebanon , and the Palestinians , the two leaders displayed mutual warmth as they embraced and smiled to cameras .
This enabled Ahmadinejad to declare on his return to Tehran that , "" Both Iran and Saudi Arabia are aware of the enemies ' conspiracies .
We decided to take measures to confront such plots .
Hopefully , this will strengthen Muslim countries against oppressive pressure by the imperialist front . ""
Allowing for the customary bluster with which Ahmadinejad expresses himself , it seems that he and the Saudi king resolved to counter the efforts being made to accentuate Sunni - Shia relations in Iraq and Lebanon for the good of the region in particular and the Muslim world at large .
Specifically , they examined ways of ending the political stalemate in Lebanon between the Washington - backed government of Fouad Siniora , and the Tehran - backed Hizbullah .
They also discussed ways of de - escalating the Sunni - Shia violence in Iraq - an aim which they , incidentally , share with the United States .
These deliberations run counter to the scenario that many pro - Bush administration commentators in America had visualised - with the Shia Iran and the Sunni Saudi Arabia intensifying their rivalry to the point of funding and training sectarian militias in Iraq to engage in a debilitating civil war .
Such analysis ignores certain salient facts about the nature of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as well as recent history .
Both Iran and Saudi Arabia are fundamentalist states .
That is , they are administered according to the Sharia , Islamic law .
The difference is that Iran has a representative system , with its citizens choosing their representatives through periodic elections , whereas Saudi Arabia is a monarchical autocracy , which does not allow citizens ' participation in the administration of the state .
During the 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq war , Riyadh sided with Iraq , which was then ruled by the secular Ba'ath party .
Yet when oil prices collapsed in the spring and summer of 1986 to $ 10 a barrel , hurting the economies of both the Saudi kingdom and Iran , Saudi King Fahd met the Iranian oil minister in October .
They backed the idea of a fixed price of $ 18 a barrel .
Being the leading exporters of oil in the Organisation of Oil Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) , their joint decision carried weight .
And when Saudi oil minister Ahmad Zaki Yamani , who had held the job for 24 years , failed to endorse this target , King Fahd dismissed him .
In other words , economic interests led to a convergence of the policies of the two leading Islamic states in the Gulf .
Following the end of the Iran - Iraq war and the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in June 1989 , the radical founder of the Islamic republic , overall relations thawed between Tehran and Riyadh .
This trend was aided by the subsequent election of Ali Akbar Hashemi - Rafsanjani , a pragmatic cleric , as president .
Rafsanjani had a cordial meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah in March 1997 , and was invited to undertake the hajj pilgrimage in Mecca the following month .
This paved the way for Iran to host the triennial summit of the Islamic Conference Organisation ( ICO ) , headquartered in Jeddah , in December .
By then Muhammad Khatami , a moderate cleric , had succeeded Rafsanjani .
The hosting of the ICO summit by Iran , which is 90 % Shia , was remarkable .
Of the 49 members of the ICO , only four were Shia - majority states .
Breaking with protocol , Khatami had two private meetings with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah .
It was after an ICO summit in Mecca last year that President Ahmadinejad reasserted ( in the presence of King Abdullah ) that the extent of the Holocaust had been exaggerated .
Overall , though , in their foreign policies , Iran and Saudi Arabia stand at opposite poles .
While Tehran has backed radical movements in the Muslim world irrespective of their sectarian allegiance ( Hamas , for instance , is a Sunni organisation ) , Riyadh has supported orthodox , conservative and fundamentalist forces among Sunni Muslims .
It was one of the three countries which recognised the Taliban regime in Afghanistan .
Yet when their leaders find that their traditional rivalry is undercutting the economic or diplomatic interests of their countries , they adopt a pragmatic stance and close ranks in the name of Islamic solidarity .
That is what happened in Riyadh at the weekend ."

2007-03-07,"The bitter rivalry between Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and the country 's leading elder statesman has erupted into a public struggle for control over economic policy .
Hashemi Rafsanjani , the president 's most influential opponent , set the scene for a power struggle by telling Iranian journalists that Mr Ahmadinejad 's "" trial period is over "" .
He said he would use his position as head of the expediency council , a state body empowered to set the Islamic regime 's long - term goals , to reshape the government 's economic policies .
The comments are the clearest sign yet of Mr Rafsanjani 's revived political clout and follow widespread discontent with Mr Ahmadinejad 's economic policies , which have resulted in rising inflation and high unemployment .
They came after Iran 's supreme leader , Ali Khamenei , made a conciliatory gesture toward Mr Ahmadinejad after appearing ready to withdraw support in the face of rising public criticism of the president .
In an act that bolstered Mr Ahmadinejad 's position , Mr Khamenei last week appointed two of the president 's allies to the expediency council to replace two supporters of Mr Rafsanjani .
Analysts say the appointments reflected Mr Khamenei 's fears that his own position might be threatened by a continuing decline in Mr Ahmadinejad 's authority .
Mr Khamenei supported Mr Ahmadinejad when he successfully contested the 2005 presidential election against Mr Rafsanjani .
In an apparent riposte to the latest manoeuvres , Mr Rafsanjani said the government 's policies were contrary to a 20-year plan approved by Iran 's most senior clerics .
He said he had previously kept quiet to give Mr Ahmadinejad time to deliver his election promises , which included reducing poverty and redistributing Iran 's oil wealth to the poor .
But he had been prompted to speak out by the government 's latest budget plans which , Mr Rafsanjani said , increase the country 's reliance on oil revenues .
He also accused the government of failing to enact privatisation plans enshrined in Iran 's constitution . ""
Now the trial period is over and the supervising role of the expediency council should be enacted more seriously , "" Mr Rafsanjani said .
"" Under the 20-year outlook plan the country 's reliance on oil should be reduced by more than 10 % each year but during the last two years this process has been reversed .
Next year 's budget depends on oil to an even greater extent than those of the last two years . ""
Dismissing charges of political interference , Mr Rafsanjani insisted it was his constitutional right to intervene .
"" People should hear about such issues from me as the person responsible for establishing these policies , "" he said .
Eesa Saharkhiz , a Tehran - based political commentator , said Mr Rafsanjani had gone public to counteract Mr Khamenei 's recent show of support for the president .
"" Rafsanjani has been weakened by the recent change of membership of the expediency council , so he is emphasising his ability to lead the body and turn it into a watchdog over the government .
Mr Khamenei is worried that if Mr Ahmadinejad is weakened , it might create a domino effect and that he will be threatened . ""
Mr Rafsanjani topped last December 's poll in elections to the experts ' assembly , an influential clerical body .
He had previously kept a low profile since his presidential defeat by Mr Ahmadinejad .
MPs must vote on the government 's proposed budget before the Iranian new year on March 21 .
The budget , from which the president 's most prominent fundamentalist allies have withheld support , proposes a 20 % rise in public spending to £ 129bn .
Mr Ahmadinejad is under fire for making an unprecedented six supplementary budget requests in the past year that economists say have drained the country 's foreign currency reserves .
The criticism has come amid rising inflation and high unemployment ."
2007-03-10,"Police in Iran arrested trade unionists in an unsuccessful attempt to stop thousands of teachers protesting against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's economic policies outside Iran 's parliament , the Guardian has learned .
Officers swooped on the homes of six union leaders on Wednesday .
The detention of key figures in teachers ' organisations failed to stop the following day 's rally , which drew an estimated 7,000 demonstrators .
The leaders were later released after interrogation .
Their arrests appeared to betray official anxiety that the protest - for teachers ' pay to be brought into line with other state workers - could provoke discontent against Mr Ahmadinejad 's government , which is being blamed for rising inflation and high unemployment ."
2007-03-12,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , is planning to respond in person to intensifying international pressure over his country 's controversial nuclear programme by taking his case directly to the United Nations security council in New York , it emerged yesterday .
Mr Ahmadinejad wanted to "" defend the rights of the Iranian nation in exploiting peaceful nuclear energy , "" state TV quoted the Iranian government spokesman , Gholam Hossein Elham , as saying .
The president would attend if the security council holds a meeting on Iran 's nuclear programme , the TV said .
South Africa 's ambassador , Dumisani Kumalo , whose country holds the council 's rotating presidency , said that if Mr Ahmadinejad made a formal request , "" it would be very difficult to deny him that opportunity "" .
The US said it was not aware that any such request had been made .
Western countries , led by the US , insist that Iran 's nuclear programme is a covert attempt to produce atomic weapons , a view reinforced by Tehran 's continuing refusal to freeze uranium enrichment .
Diplomatic efforts are under way to agree new UN sanctions to force it to comply .
The sensitivity of the issue is highlighted in a report today by a leading British foreign affairs think - tank warning that Israel - with its own large but undeclared nuclear arsenal - faces "" dire and far - reaching consequences "" if it takes military action against the Iranian programme .
Israeli airstrikes were possible , though "" extremely risky "" , and Iran could retaliate with massive ballistic missile attacks on cities such as Tel Aviv or Haifa with "" substantial "" loss of life , says Yossi Mekelberg of Chatham House 's Middle East programme .
""
An Israeli military operation against Iran would hurt Israel 's long - term interests .
It would be detrimental to Israel 's overall security and the political and economic consequences would be dire and far - reaching , "" the report said .
But it warned too that the Israelis may feel compelled to act if they believed Tehran was close to developing a nuclear bomb . ""
Any military operation against Iran , as well as involving many casualties , would enhance the appeal of extremism in the Muslim world , inside and outside Iran , at the expense of the moderates .
"" If diplomacy failed , the report proposes that Israel could move to a policy of deterrence by openly declaring its own nuclear capability , mirroring the "" balance of terror "" that kept the peace between the west and the Soviet bloc in the cold war .
In Dubai , the French foreign minister Phillippe Douste - Blazy agreed that military action would destabilise the region and insisted that sanctions would have to be imposed on Iran .
Last December the security council imposed sanctions including a ban on the transfer of sensitive nuclear technology and threatened further measures if Iran failed to suspend enrichment .
The five permanent council members plus Germany are now consulting on new proposals including a travel ban , an expanded list of people , organisations and companies subject to an asset freeze - including the Revolutionary Guards and the state - owned Bank Sepah - as well as an arms embargo and trade restrictions .
Russia and China , however , have strong reservations , and any decision needs a consensus .
In a related development , the Syrian president , Bashar al - Assad , yesterday met the Iranian defence minister , Mostafa Najjar , to discuss military links between the two countries .
Syria is Iran 's only Arab ally at a time of deepening confrontation between Arab states and Tehran .
The two countries both support the Lebanese movement Hizbullah and the Palestinian Hamas while Iran has close links to Shia parties in Iraq .
Syria has been improving its arsenal since last summer 's war between Hizbullah and Israel while Iran has been upgrading its military capabilities ."
2007-03-14,"Hollywood is already firmly established as a source of cultural decadence in Iran 's pantheon of hated western symbols .
But now the country 's Islamic leadership has accused it of "" psychological warfare "" over its depiction of the battle between the Greeks and Persians at Thermopylae in 480BC , regarded as a key event in the birth of western democracy by some historians .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's government has joined MPs , bloggers and local media in denouncing the newly - released Warner Brothers epic , 300 , as a calculated attempt to demonise Iran at a time of intensifying US pressure over the country 's nuclear programme .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's spokesman branded the film "" an insult to Iran "" while four MPs have urged the foreign ministry to pressure other Muslim countries to ban it .
The film , directed by Zack Snyder and based on a novel by Frank Miller , grossed nearly £ 40 m in ticket sales in three days after opening in north American cinemas last week .
It portrays the heroic endeavours of 300 Spartans , under King Leonidas , who are shown resisting an invading force of 120,000 Persian troops led by Emperor Xerxes .
The plot depicts the tiny Spartan force repeatedly outmanoeuvring the invaders and being defeated after a three - day stand - off only through treachery .
Iranians complain that it represents them as savage , murderous and warmongering .
The film 's availability in Iran has been limited so far to pirate DVDs , but that has not stopped an outpouring of official condemnation .
The government spokesman , Gholamhossein Elham , described the film as "" cultural intrusion "" and an attack on Iran 's ancient civilisation . ""
Such a fabrication of culture and insult to people is not acceptable by any nation or government , "" he told reporters . ""
[ Iran ] considers it as hostile behaviour which is the result of cultural and psychological warfare . ""
The reformist newspaper , Ayandehno , accused the makers of trying to set international opinion against Iran to fit President George Bush 's description of the country as belonging to an "" axis of evil "" .
"" In the film Iranians are considered to be monsters devoid of any culture , humanity and wisdom who know nothing except attacking other lands , threatening peace and killing human beings .
There is no option other than to confront , fight and destroy this wicked tribe so that the world can be saved from this axis of evil , "" the paper 's film critic wrote .
It is not the first Hollywood production to cause upset in Iran .
There was widespread anger over the favourable portrayal of Alexander the Great in the 2004 film , Alexander .
The Macedonian king is reviled in Iranian culture for destroying the seat of Persian imperial greatness at Persepolis after defeating Emperor Darius III in 330BC ."
2007-03-14,"QUESTION :
What is the one thing you would most like to see happen by this time next year ?
I hope that by this time next year Iran 's incompetent president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , will have been impeached by the parliament and replaced , at least , with a moderate conservative .
There is growing dissatisfaction with his inexperienced administration , both among ordinary Iranians and the establishment .
After all , people elected him in the hope of seeing a higher quality of life and instead they 've found themselves , after a year , living in a dysfunctional state threatened with global economic isolation .
The irony is that the Islamic Republic of Iran , perhaps the only true post - colonial state in the world , has never behaved so responsibly on the global scene , mainly as a result of the moderate foreign policy adopted by Mohammad Khatami , the previous ( reformist ) president .
Yet the same country is now one of the most demonised states in the world , mainly because of Ahmadinejad 's rhetoric , especially his naive , simplistic and empty anti - Israeli line .
( Empty because the Iranian constitution gives the president no control over the military in Iran and the commander in chief , Ali Khamenei , has repeatedly shown implicit support for a two - state solution . )
Ahmadinejad 's rhetoric , as an Israeli rightwing newspaper sarcastically puts it , makes him look like a perfect Israeli agent in his unquestionable service to Israel .
At the same time , he has damaged Iran 's national interest more than any other living Iranian on the planet .
The case for his democratic removal from the office is so strong that it is not wishful thinking any more .
The conservative - dominated parliament is already gathering signatures to formally summon and question him - which is a first step in the path towards impeachment .
But if gone , Ahmadinejad would also take with him and burn the huge investment that rightwing Americans and Israelis have made in him to paint Iran as threatening to the world peace .
Iran could not possibly look as dangerous without Ahmadinejad , and the west has made a mistake in putting all its eggs in one basket .

The film tells the story of the some 300 Spartans who made a stand against a far greater Persian army in 480BC , at the battle of Thermopylae . ""
Today they are trying to tamper with history by making a film and by making Iran 's image look savage , "" Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said , adding that a cultural campaign against Iran would not succeed .
The film has enraged Iranian officials and others over its depiction of the ancient Persians , the ancestors of modern day Iranians , with complaints that it depicts them as murderous and warmongering .
Mr Ahmadinejad did not specifically name any film but it is almost certainly the Hollywood blockbuster "" 300 "" , which he had in mind .
Last week , the presdient 's spokesman lambasted the Warner Brothers film , describing it as an insult and part of a psychological war against Iran .
Today , Mr Ahmadinejad made his first direct remarks about the row , speaking during a televised address to mark the start of the Iranian New Year , Reuters reported .
"" By psychological war , propaganda and misuse of the organisations they have themselves created , and for which they have written the rules , and over which they have a monopoly , they are trying to prevent our nation 's development . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad is not alone in seeing the film as part of broader campaign to vilify the Islamic republic , at a time when it is locked in a standoff with the west over its nuclear programme .
The new film - the original version was made in 1962 - is only available in Iran on pirated DVDs but it has still attracted widespread condemnation from some bloggers , the Iranian media , and various officials .
Western academics have also questioned the film 's historical accuracy .
The film , directed by Zack Snyder and based on a novel by Frank Miller , attracted mixed critical reviews but grossed nearly £ 40 m in its first three days in North America earlier this month .
It portrays the heroic endeavours of 300 Spartans , under King Leonidas , who resist a large invading force of Persians led by Emperor Xerxes , which some accounts suggest totalled more than 120,000 men .
The battle has become famous as one of the greatest examples of a military last stand and the importance of professional soldiering and use of terrain .
The Greeks blocked the only road and held the greater force for a number of days , inflicting huge losses on the Persians , before losing the position .
Some critics were unhappy with 300 's heavily stylised colouring and computer generated action and reliance on violent scenes , though others said it was visually arresting ."

The Independent reports that the TV station has close links to the Revolutionary Guards and that , "" Because it only broadcasts in Arabic rather than Persian , few Iranians would have seen the footage , suggesting there is still much opposition to escalating the crisis .
"" Our own front - page story revealed : "" Patrick Cronin , director of studies at the International Institute of Strategic Studies , said the crisis represented a counterattack by Tehran radicals after months of international pressure over Iran 's nuclear programme . '
They clearly want to change the subject .
They want to go on the offensive . '
"" There is evidence , "" the article continued , "" that the 15 sailors and marines were captured and are being held by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , ( IRGC ) which represents a state within a state , with its own forces , its own political representatives and its own hardline ideology .
Al - Alam is thought to have ties to ultra - conservative factions in Tehran . ""
An added difficulty in resolving the conflict is the 17-day new year holiday in Iran , which is observed by almost everyone .
Not only have there been no newspapers available for more than a week , making the crisis invisible to the average Iranian , but our embassy staff have few counterparts to talk to and , even when they make contact , may be talking to the wrong faction .
Britain 's secret service is blamed for most incidents that take place in Iran and the British are seen in the popular consciousness as "" puppet masters "" in the region , making dialogue even more difficult ."

Vahid Salemi / APMahmoud Ahmadinejad certainly has a sense of political theatre .
After droning on about American and British perfidy for about an hour at his press conference today , the Iranian president pulled a rabbit out of the proverbial rabbit and announced a "" gift "" to the British people : the release of the 15 British naval personnel held by Iran .
Gordon Brown and his budget surprises were nothing compared with this bravura performance - complete with the award of a bravery medal to the commander of the Revolutionary Guard naval patrol that seized the 15 Britons .
So - barring any last minute hitches - the crisis that began almost two weeks ago has ended as suddenly as it began .
The families of the 15 sailors and marines are understandably ecstatic .
The mother of one of the captives , Sandra Sperry , started jumping and down while shopping at an Asda supermarket .
But there will inevitably be lingering questions .
It is yet to be determined whether the two British dinghies were really in Iraqi or Iranian waters .
Questions will also be asked as to whether the service personnel were dangerously exposed as they went about their work in an area buzzing , at a time of heightened tension , with US and British warships .
There will , moreover , be queries about the behaviour of the 15 captives , who were filmed "" confessing "" that they had strayed into Iranian waters .
In a deft touch , Mr Ahmadinejad , who seemed to be revelling in the limelight , asked Tony Blair not to "" punish "" the crew for their confessions .
Finally , questions remain about Iranian motives and intentions .
Some analysts believe the incident was deliberately provoked by a Tehran determined to show that it has a few cards up its sleeve in its current war of nerves with the west .
Even if the capture was more a moment of opportunism , it has still had that result ."
2007-04-04,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said he was releasing the 15 captive Britons to mark the anniversary of the birth of the prophet Muhammad , as well as Easter .
The cheerful announcement , however , also coincided with news that the US authorities might allow a consular visit to five Iranians they have been holding in Iraq since January .
President Ahmadinejad adamantly denied a deal was done here .
But a senior Iranian source suggested that while the capture of the British naval crew had not been motivated by the US seizure of the Iranian officials in Irbil two months earlier , it did raise the issue of double standards .
Why was one group being called hostages , and the subject of international outrage , while the other group , the Iranians , were forgotten , the Iranian source wanted to know .
The US response is that the Iranians in Irbil were Revolutionary Guards caught red - handed fomenting the insurgency .
The Iraqi government appears to have played a critical role in the resolution of the crisis .
Although he may not have been directly asked to broker a deal , neither the British nor the Iranians stopped Hoshyar Zebari , the Iraqi foreign minister , from pressing for progress on the handling of the "" Irbil five "" and the release on Monday of another Iranian diplomat who had been seized by unidentified gunmen wearing Iraqi military uniforms .
Earlier in the day , British diplomats had been told to expect to see "" light at the end of the tunnel "" at President Ahmadinejad 's presentation , but they were taken by surprise when the tunnel itself came to an end .
It is not clear what this surprise move does to the British proposal to send an expert delegation to talk about operations in the northern Gulf more generally , but it certainly means there is much less urgency in such a mission .
It may well be that the Iranian government decided there was greater political gain in a grand gesture .
It makes Tehran look generous rather than grudging , enabled President Ahmadinejad to project a smiley rather than a scowling persona , and may go a long way to remove the sour taste left by the whole incident in the international arena .
In the west , meanwhile , it arguably strengthens the hand of the diplomats in the ceaseless debate with the hawks over what to do about Iran .
After all , the doves can say , patient negotiation won the day .
After scoring an own goal , Iran can claim to have come out of the game with at least a draw ."
2007-04-04,"Fifteen British marines and sailors held captive in Iran for almost a fortnight are expected to fly home tomorrow morning after the country 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , announced their release as a "" gift "" to the UK .
In a surprise announcement during a news conference at the presidential palace in Tehran , Mr Ahmadinejad said the 14 men and one woman would be "" going back home "" in a move marking the birthday of the prophet Muhammad last Saturday and acknowledging Easter .
Iran 's IRNA state news agency said later the Britons would leave Tehran tomorrow at 8 am ( 5.30am UK time ) on a flight to London .
Immediately after the news conference , Iranian television showed footage of the naval crew effusively thanking Mr Ahmadinejad on the steps of the palace .
Dressed in grey suits , apart from the sole female captive , Leading Seaman Faye Turney , who was wearing a striped top and a headscarf , they appeared delighted .
"" We are very grateful for your forgiveness , "" said one of the male captives , Lieutenant Felix Carman .
"" You are welcome , "" Mr Ahmadinejad responded in Farsi .
"" You came here on a compulsory trip , "" the Iranian leader told another , getting the answer : "" I do n't know if I 'd put it like that
but you could call it that . ""
Tony Blair welcomed the news , calling the crew 's imminent freedom "" a profound relief not just to them but to their families , that have endured such distress and anxiety over these past 12 days "" .
Britain had taken "" a measured approach , firm but calm , not negotiating but not confronting either "" , he said , adding in a message to the Iranian people that he hoped any other disagreements could be resolved peacefully .
Relatives of the detainees reacted with uncontained delight .
Sandra Sperry , the mother of Royal Marine Adam Sperry , told Sky News : "" I 'm absolutely ecstatic ...
I heard in Asda ...
I think everyone thought I had gone mad ...
we thought it would drag into next week .
"" It had been feared that Mr Ahmadinejad - renowned for being a hardliner and a critic of the west - would use his news conference to make more demands relating to the captives .
The initial signs were not positive : the president began with a long complaint about the invasion of Iraq , also criticising Britain for taking the case of the captives to the UN security council .
He also presented medals to three members of the Revolutionary Guard naval patrol that seized the Britons as they searched an Indian - registered merchant ship just outside the mouth of the Shatt al - Arab waterway , which divides Iran and Iraq .
But in a dramatic flourish about an hour into the address , the president suddenly announced : "" While insisting on our rights , these 15 sailors have been pardoned and we offer their freedom to the British people . ""
Iran repeatedly said the patrol had been in Iranian waters , but Britain presented GPS evidence last week that it said proved the UK personnel had been well inside the Iraqi zone .
Later on during his two hour - plus press conference , Mr Ahmadinejad said the British government had sent a letter to Iran 's foreign ministry pledging that incursions "" will not happen again "" .
Iranian TV has shown a series of broadcasts in which some of the detainees have apparently admitted being in Iranian water , prompting an angry reaction from British officials .
In a seemingly mischievous aside during his press conference , Mr Ahmadinejad said he hoped this would not get them into trouble , saying : "" I ask Mr Blair not to punish the soldiers with the charge of accepting and telling the truth .
"" There has been speculation that the release was prompted in part by an agreement to let an Iranian representative meet five Iranians detained by US forces in Irbil , northern Iraq , in January .
Tehran says the men are diplomats ; the US says they are Revolutionary Guards linked to insurgents in Iraq .
There have been claims that Tehran orchestrated the seizure of the British crew with a view to an exchange .
The US insisted today that there was no connection between the cases .
"" Not that I am aware of , "" said a State Department spokesman , Tom Casey , when asked if there was a link ."
2007-04-04,"Channel 4 has said it will look at bringing forward the delayed broadcast of its Iraq drama
The Mark of Cain following Iran 's announcement this afternoon that it will free the 15 seized British sailors and marines .
The broadcaster announced this morning that it would pull the drama from tomorrow night 's schedule because of the ongoing crisis surrounding the troops .
But just hours later , the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , announced at a press conference that he would release all 15 of the personnel today as a "" gift "" to Britain .
A Channel 4 spokeswoman said the broadcaster would stick with its decision to postpone the drama , but would now look at airing it before its rescheduled May 17 air date .
"" There is a strong possibility we will make a judgment call in the next couple of days to look at an earlier slot than May 17 , "" she said .
Channel 4 said this morning that it had decided to postpone transmission of the drama - which deals with the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by British troops - because negotiations to release the personnel were still ongoing .
The timing of the drama had been criticised by some of the families of the captured personnel .

2007-04-04,"It was showtime in Tehran and the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , put on quite a spectacle .
It would be easy to pour scorn on his diatribe about western interference in the Gulf , his posturing as a Muslim who can stand up to the big powers , and his apparently magnanimous "" gift "" of returning to Britain Britons whom his forces had seized .
The more uncomfortable truth is that the Iranian president was expressing a widely held belief in Iran that Britain and America are behind much of his nation 's woes .
Much of this commonly held grievance is well - founded .
To go back no further than the Iran - Iraq war , it is true Britain knew Saddam Hussein was using chemical weapons against Tehran and took part in a campaign to cover it up .
If Britain should apologise for anything , it should be the way it covertly supported a dictator it was later to topple , because , at that time , the Iraqi regime was deemed the lesser of two evils .
Britain was officially neutral in that war , but that neutrality cost hundreds of thousands of Iranian lives .
The real question is whether the west should keep feeding the popular sense of grievance on which the revolutionary Islamic regime feeds .
Domestically , the Iranian president emerges as a winner from this episode .
As a Persian nationalist , he showed he could stand up to much greater military forces .
As a Muslim , he is also consciously addressing an Arab audience and saying the things many Arabs feel in their hearts to be true about western double standards .
Internationally , he has shown that Iran has a number of what are called asymmetric options to hit back at the old imperialist enemy .
If five members of the Revolutionary Guard are arrested in Irbil in northern Iraq , or a top general goes missing in Istanbul , this episode is a reminder that Iran , too , can arrest foreign troops .
The neoconservative lobby , whose star has dimmed but not been extinguished in Washington , will also draw solace from this crisis .
If this is how the Iranian military behave with light boats , they argue , just imagine what the Revolutionary Guard would do with a nuclear bomb , or even just enough fissile material to make one .
All the difficulties encountered in negotiating the release of the British crew - the fact you are dealing with a revolutionary regime , when any negotiator can be outflanked by someone deemed to be more radical , the fact that there are frequent changes of tack , or that ideology is constantly getting in the way of the issue at hand - will be compounded in talks about Iran 's uranium enrichment programme .
The harder lesson to draw from this crisis is that a combination of diplomatic pressure and direct negotiation does work .
Even if the process is messy , the outcome is the right one .
In the end , direct bilateral negotiation is the only way to address a historical sense of grievance .
At the very least , it can produce gestures which make meaningful progress on substantive issues possible .
International isolation only feeds fundamentalism and gives contemporary meaning to the hard - fought lessons of a nation state 's history ."
2007-04-04,"So they are freed .
The 15 British sailors and marines are - in the words of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad - pardoned .
They are shaking hands with him in front of television cameras and are off to their distant island .
The crisis seems to be over and I am to write about the Iranian perception of all this - my perception of the crisis .
Curiously , I am struggling to find the words .
Something is not quite right .
It is not that I do not feel relieved ; indeed , I do .
Not that I find writing about my views difficult , or expressing my feelings burdensome ; it is just that this time I am not quite sure about how I feel .
Do I think the Islamic Republic was right to seize the British servicemen and woman ?
No .
Do I believe Blair 's "" all innocent "" plea just because he shouts it ?
No .
Having evoked identical answers , do I see anything else in common between the two ?
Yes .
They have both let their people down .
And in this , whether or not the marines had trespassed into Iranian waters is irrelevant .
Where exactly the incident happened , why - really - the two sides were there , or on whose orders they did what they did are facts well beyond my capacity to establish .
And as I said , they are of very little relevance , if any , to my principal feeling about those who perpetuated this crisis .
For I do not trust them .
Comforting it is , indeed , to see the rhetoric fade and the hope for a happy end loom .
Yet , the troubling question remains unanswered :
could I - and would I - readily take to the streets and proudly hail my side now that it has all come to an end ?
Not so sure , for there is no such side as mine .
I was greatly relieved to hear it end , and I wish it had done so sooner .
But I can not side with a government that , against the honest will of its people , and against the loud and clear voice of every human 's reason , embarks on a holy journey to provide freedom thousands of miles away - yet , all it does is to create there a frightening scene of anarchy .
And it is no better on this side .
For I can not side with a government that ignores the very basic rights of its people , my people , on a daily basis and yet fills every wall , and every blank piece of its children 's mind , with a superficial right to nuclear energy .
As an Iranian - given the historical facts about the British presence in "" Persia "" - it is all but obvious not to trust the British government .
It is painful on another scale , though , not to be able to trust your own government when it stands seemingly firm against the former .
The current crisis was resolved in less than two weeks , giving Iranians some reason to be hopeful about other outstanding issues threatening their country .
All it took this time , and would arguably take in other instances , was a face - saving formula for both sides to cheer their "" victory "" and salute their brave sons and daughters .
Yet , the uncomfortable position of the ordinary Iranian lingers on : faced with the suspicious , if not hostile , looks of the "" others "" and a constant fear of the worst to come from "" their own "" .
It really is an awkward position just to be Iranian , ordinary and sane ."
2007-04-04,"British officials were promised by their Iranian counterparts that there would be light at the end of the tunnel of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's speech .
And there was .
In a "" gift to the British people "" the president pardoned the 15 servicemen his forces had seized in Iraqi waters 13 days earlier .
It was a sophisticated piece of political theatre , in which the president turned what had become a diplomatic disaster for Iran into something of a personal victory .
First he gave the west a lecture about the history of its meddling in Iran ; then he decorated the commander of the Iranian coastguard crew who had arrested the British marines and sailors .
Not only had Mr Ahmadinejad seized ownership of the issue from his rival Ali Larijani , secretary of the Supreme National Security Council , but he had shown mercy in the face of British aggression .
Cut to the loop of film which showed some of the servicemen dressed in suits personally thanking the president for his act of clemency and the whole drama has a happy ending .
Or does it ?
What are the lessons to be drawn from this episode and who profits from it ?
In the short term , the Iranian regime can be shown to have reasserted its territorial rights and its sovereignty after a series of international humiliations , such as the arrest of five Iranians by the Americans in Irbil , the disappearance and presumed defection of a top general on a trip to Istanbul , and the mysterious death of a top Iranian nuclear scientist .
It is too early to say whether a deal was cut between London and Tehran , although it is interesting to note that consular access has been given to Iranians in US custody .
The incident could also teach the British navy to be not quite so relaxed about its personnel in waters where the international boundary changes according to the seasonal rise of the mud banks .
The British crew were ripe for the plucking .
Just because it had worked properly 66 times did not mean it would work a 67th time , as events proved .
The Iranians say they had issued three warnings to the British navy before , but ultimately nothing excuses the Iranian action .
At the very most , the British crew should have been escorted out of Iranian territorial waters .
The larger issue is the effect of all this on the wider stage .
A sword of Damocles heavier than anything Britain can fashion is hanging over Iran , and it is the conviction of hawks in Washington and the defence establishment in Israel that the only way Iran can be prevented from enriching uranium is to bomb it .
There can be little doubt that a war plan exists , and that the two US carrier groups in the Gulf are practising bombing runs that they are capable of carrying out .
For the moment , US policy is to exert maximum pressure on Tehran through economic sanctions .
For over 10 years Europe , including Britain , argued that the best way of tackling the Islamic regime was through a course of constructive engagement , culminating in a grand bargain , by which Iran would get trade and investment deals , in return for surrendering its right to enrich uranium and receiving the material it needed for its civilian nuclear fuel cycle from abroad .
The grand bargain is still on the table , although perched on the edge .
The neoconservatives argue that if this is how a conventionally armed Iran behaves , how would a nuclear - capable Iran or its proxies act ?
But surely the real lesson to draw from yesterday 's theatre is that quiet diplomacy does work and that it can work in the future .
It is easy in Washington to pour scorn on Nancy Pelosi 's efforts to engage with the Syrian leadership .
But the Democratic house speaker is right to break the ban on US official contacts with Syria .
There is no substitute for direct negotiation , especially with a revolutionary Islamic regime in Iran , for whom the popularly held grievance about past American and British interference in the Gulf is as important as the issue in hand ."
2007-04-04,"Weeks into the crisis triggered by Iran 's illegal capture of 15 British naval personnel , the European Union 's irresolute and contradictory approach is making matters worse .
Faced with a country whose leader is bent on acquiring nuclear weapons , the EU 's leaders are simply dithering , fearing that the fire next door in Iraq could somehow spread .
The latest crisis proves again that Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad can not be trusted .
Following the ambush of the UK forces , the Iranian authorities dissembled as to their exact location at the time of the abduction , which was subsequently proven by the UK government to have been in Iraqi territorial waters operating under the authority of UN resolutions and with the express consent of the Iraqi government .
What Ahmedinejad appears to want are bargaining chips to secure the release of six Iranians who were aiding the Iraqi insurgency before being captured by the US .
The EU 's reluctance to match America 's robust language on Iran is emboldening him .
Ahmedinejad can sense an international community divided , and like his fellow pariah leader , North Korea 's Kim Jong - il , he is exploiting that division at every opportunity .
The uniquely dangerous combination of a nuclear Iran , which seeks to inspire the Shia in the Gulf states to rise up against their Sunni masters , coupled with Ahmedinejad 's millenarian mysticism , poses an existential threat to Israel .
It also threatens to touch off a nuclear arms race in the Middle East .
And if Iran succeeds in acquiring long - range ballistic missiles , the security threat will become global .
Indeed , the established concept of nuclear deterrence through "" mutual assured destruction "" ( MAD ) , which kept the peace between the Soviet Union and Nato , may not apply with a ruler like Ahmadinejad , who believes in the sacred merits of martyrdom .
MAD simply wo n't work for a mad man who is guided by quasi - messianic certitude .
Those who believe that Ahmedinejad is a bluffer and a buffoon who would pull back from the brink may be fundamentally misreading his psychology .
It is past time for Europe 's leaders to grasp the reality of the situation .
The possibility of degrading Iran 's nuclear weapons programme through military action can not be totally discounted although it should , of course , be the last option and would be immensely risky even if militarily possible .
Yet there is much more that EU leaders can do to undermine the regime economically .
The EU 's trade significance for Iran is huge , accounting for 40 % of the country 's imports and a quarter of its exports .
Economic links are historically strong and growing .
Some two - thirds of Iranian industry , most of it state controlled , relies on German engineering exports , 65 % of which in 2005 came with export credit insurance guarantees from the German government .
Likewise , the European Investment Bank is providing $ 1billion to finance the construction of the Nabucco oil pipeline from Iran to Austria .
If completed , the Nabucco pipeline will make Iran an indispensable EU energy partner .
As an organ of the EU , the EIB should be pursuing an ethical investment policy .
This is difficult to reconcile with lending to a country like Iran , which publicly executes individuals for sexual "" deviance "" , imprisons women who protest peacefully , and silences journalists who are critical of the regime .
The EU needs to tell Iran that unless it releases the British hostages and moderates its nuclear ambitions , it will receive no export guarantees .
Such a policy would stop trade between Iran and the EU in its tracks , and Ahmadinejad knows it .
There are already signs of disquiet among more moderate Iranian policymakers , as Ahmadinejad 's economic mismanagement has begun to fuel higher inflation .
A cut in export guarantees would put the Iranian economy - and Ahmedinejad - in real jeopardy .
Individual companies , mindful of US sanctions on those who do business with the regime , can also help .
For example , British Petroleum ( BP ) , to its credit , has disinvested from Iran on ethical grounds - an example that other European firms should follow .
The Iranian government 's contempt for the international community reflects its contempt for human rights and civilised norms .
Yet Iranians ' hunger for change is clear .
Despite repression , Iran 's civil society is well developed and sophisticated .
The Ahmadinejad government 's popularity has plummeted , as evidenced by recent local election results .
Europe 's political leaders need to recognise that now is the time to facilitate change in Iran by suspending export credit guarantees , stopping EIB financing , and speaking with a united voice .
Wishing the problem away will only make it worse .

As the Home Office prepares to be split in two and its "" Safe , Just and Tolerant "" motto awaits the necessary rewording , the Backbencher notices that the new Border and Immigration Agency has celebrated its creation by ramping up immigration fees to deter the unwanted .
While seasonal workers still pay just £ 12 - so there should be no shortage of minimum - wage strawberry pickers this summer - the price of applying for right of abode has risen almost sevenfold , and indefinite leave to remain , whether you get it or not , costs an offputting £ 750 .

Great Dilemmas of Modern Government , part 6578
: Can we send asylum seekers back to Iraq ?
This is a tough one , obviously , but the Backbencher can report that the Border and Immigration Agency has wrapped it up .
Back in December , the UN High Commission for Refugees said there was no way of ensuring that people sent back to central and southern Iraq would be safe from persecution , "" given the reach of both state and non - state agents of persecution , the lack of national protection and grave insecurity and human rights violations prevailing in those parts "" .
You might think this posed a problem for BIA officials keen to repatriate Iraqi asylum seekers .
And you would be right .
However , there 's always a different way of looking at it . ""
Asylum and human rights claims are not decided on the basis of a general approach , they are based on the circumstances of the individual and the specific risk to that individual , "" says the Iraq Country Policy Bulletin . ""
UNHCR 's conclusion ... is not therefore accepted . ""
So if a returnee is worried about being persecuted in his home town , he can nominate a different one to be returned to .
Thoughtful , no ?
The Backbencher notes that one of the sources cited in this bulletin is a dead link to the Iraqi embassy in the UK 's tourist information page .

Still , things can only get better , eh ?

At a pre - arranged press conference in Tehran , he strode on stage clad in a pale suit , hands held self - deprecatingly aloft and wearing the mischevious grin which has the ability to cause unease from the Knesset to Capitol Hill .
Squinting out through banks of television lights and camera flashes , the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran started off doing what he does best .
Knowing he would be watched by millions both at home and abroad , he launched into his favourite international adversaries - Britain and America - in vintage fashion .
The two countries were shaping global affairs for their own ends , he said .
They were acting against the interests of justice through their veto power in the UN security council .
They were irresponsible superpowers who needed to be brought down to size .
He kept it up for 40 minutes before introducing his audience to the revolutionary guards who had accosted the British sailors .
He gave each a medal , a kiss and the thanks of their leader .
But then came the theatrical flourish , the rabbit up his showman 's sleeve .
"" On the occasion of the birthday of the great prophet [ Muhammad ] ... and for the occasion of the passing of Christ , I say the Islamic Republic government and the Iranian people , with all powers and legal right to put the soldiers on trial , forgave those 15 , "" he said , referring to the Muslim prophet 's birthday on March 30 and the Easter holiday . ""
This pardon is a gift to the British people . ""
Even in the midst of his generosity and as the assembled press - and no doubt most of the watching world struggled with the import of his words - he could not resist using Faye Turney , the only female sailor among the captives , to have a dig at the liberal western values he so deplores .
"" How can they send a mother away from her home and her children , "" he asked .
"" Why do n't they respect the family in the west ? ""
The president then delivered a second headline - grabbing coup de grace by meeting and greeting the newly freed Britons in person .
Gazing beatifically into the faces of sailors visibly relieved to be going home , Mr Ahmadinejad knew he was projecting an image of compassion and magnanimity far removed from the firebrand third world revolutionary of western notoriety . ""
So you came on a mandatory vacation , "" he said to one seaman in a display of the mischievous humour he occasionally reveals in public appearances .
As the president no doubt anticipated , the sailors gratefully played along , with one telling him : "" Your people have been really kind to us , and we appreciate it very much . ""
Another told him : "" We are grateful for your forgiveness . ""
Of course , the "" Easter gift "" for Britain was not Mr Ahmadinejad 's alone .
Until yesterday , the president had been uncharacteristically quiet throughout the 13-day crisis , with many commentators speculating that he had been ordered to lie low lest his fiery rhetorical instincts derailed a negotiated solution .
The decision to free the sailors appeared to have been collective , approved finally by the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , after negotiations with London , led by Ali Larijani , secretary of Iran 's supreme national security council .
In bearing the good tidings with such flourish , however , Mr Ahmadinejad , proved his ability in maximising a political opportunity .
In truth , he badly needed the limelight to restore his fortunes , which have been waning in recent months .
Under pressure from domestic critics because of Iran 's struggling economy , the president has been increasingly dismissed at home and abroad as a declining force .
Whether that perception will now change is uncertain .
But one thing unlikely to alter is Mr Ahmadinejad 's combativeness - or , it seems , his sense for the big occasion ."
2007-04-05,"It was , depending upon your perspective , either a triumph for quiet - yet - fim British diplomacy or a PR coup for the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
But as 15 British sailors and marines return to the UK , ending one of the more convoluted international standoffs of recent years , what do many bloggers want to talk about ?
The suits , of course .
The outfits made their debut yesterday afternoon , when the captives were paraded before Mr Ahmadinejad in order to thank him for allowing them to return home .
While leading seaman Faye Turney made do with what looked like a hooped dress and cardigan combo , her 14 male comrades sported ill - fitting three - button suits in various shades of grey that looked suspiciously similar in cut to the president 's own , lighter - coloured version .
A Canadian blogger , Michelle , was one of many to notice this similarity , saying : How strangely funny that before they were released they were all dressed to look like president nutbag Ahmadinejad .
One of her readers responded : Well , he DID say this was a gift to the British people .
Maybe he decided to give away his entire collection of suits , too ... what a standup guy !
The British news digest site Anorak.co.uk had a different take on the pictures of the captives lined up and waving at the cameras : Put a caption of a different sort beneath the picture and you have a shot of the UK 's yachting team return[ing ] home after a triumphant performance in the inaugural Allied - Axis Of Evil Games .
Departing from sartorial matters , the Iranian - born , Canada - based blogger Hoder deduced 10 "" lessons "" from the affair , including that Iran had "" won the PR game "" and its president was "" one heck of a street - smart politician "" .
A Tehran - based site , The Adventures of Mr Behi , had another view :
I hope that the world would also please stop evil - izing Iran .
So we have a naughty government ...
you do not have to tell us over and over , we already know it :)
Finally , a comment from a newspaper , rather than a blog , written before the announcement of the captives ' release but worth mentioning for its sheer bile and scorn .
In allowing themselves to be captured without a shot being fired , and then being shown confessing to having crossed into Iranian waters , the UK crew disgraced themselves , said the New York Post columnist Ralph Peters , a soldier - turned journalist .
Jingoism aside , I ca n't imagine any squad of US marines behaving in such a shabby , cowardly fashion .
Our marines would have fought to begin with .
Taken captive by force , they would 've resisted collaboration .
To the last man and woman ... The Iranians judged their victims well : the British boat crews did n't make even a token effort at defending themselves .
Now their boo - hoo - we - quit government is n't defending them , either .
Was Margaret Thatcher the last real man in Britain ?
In case any readers missed his point , Mr Peters ends with a colloquial flourish by referring to the captives as "" those wankers "" ."
2007-04-05,"The fact that the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , looked like a smartened - up version of Peter Falk in Columbo as he engaged in banter with the 15 British sailors and marines added to the sense that this whole episode has , at times , resembled some kind of surreal television pseudo - reality show .
A propaganda coup for Iran ?
Of course , not least because , whatever the rights and wrongs of Iranian society , Ahmadinejad 's "" show time "" , as David Hearst calls it , has neatly illustrated how the term "" British values "" appears confused and pretty threadbare . ""
Why was the difficult task of searching the seas given to a mother thousands of miles from home ? ""
asked the president , referring to Leading Seaman Faye Turney . ""
How can you justify seeing a mother away from her home , her children ?
Why do n't they respect family values in the west ?
"" Women have long had symbolic value in the cause of patriotism but as maidens and mothers - to be protected , rescued and idealised , demonstrating our allegedly innate superiority over the nasty foreigners - not cast in the role of ( poorly trained ) defender of the high seas .
Nationalism always plays to a nostalgic tune and many British viewers watching the president 's performance on television will perhaps think he has a point .
Especially if they had read the reports of the latest government study into childcare that says long periods in daycare increases the risks of "" problem behaviour "" .
Iranian women are also flooding into education and paid work and the pressure for change is already being gradually exercised on the male Iranian establishment .
Still , in the UK , Ahmadinejad 's words probably hit a nerve for that section of the British population who believe that the march of women into money - driven , unreconstructed , masculine territory has all gone too far , sacrificing what 's at the heart of any stable society - the family .
While many of the relatives of the captured 15 celebrated exuberantly , clinking bottles ( the television news was awash with alcohol last night ) , by contrast , the sailors themselves appeared in rude good health , not least , perhaps , for having an enforced period of abstention - that increasingly rare state in the western world .
Who looks after detainees better - Iranians dressing their involuntary "" guests "" in C&amp;A bridegroom suits or the "" civilised "" British and Americans and their despicable abuse of captives in Guantánamo Bay ?
Yesterday Blair said , "" Throughout we have taken a measured approach , firm but calm , not negotiating but not confronting either . ""
Once upon a time , firm , fair and decent were supposed to be the clarion call of What It Meant To Be British .
Now , the first reaction of many is to assume he 's doing what he does best - telling porky pies .
As David Hearst points out , the Iranians have every good reason to dislike the British - not least in propping up the corrupt and greedy Shah of Persia for years .
Just look at Britain 's complicity in the Iran - Iraq war , when Britain knew Saddam Hussein was using chemical weapons against Tehran and took part in a campaign to cover it up .
Of course , this has been a humiliation for Britain , confirming we are a second - rate power , led by a man who , even as he mouths words that are supposed to have a patriotic resonance , reveals how his actions have emptied the vacuous phrase he has used so often in the past- "" proud to be British "" - of all meaning , let alone respect .
We are in no position to bully and lecture Iran when our government has positively damaged the small progress made towards inclusive citizenship - one that rejects mythical superior national characteristics that supported a deeply racist British empire and concentrates instead on achieving liberty , equality and fraternity , here and abroad .
Without war ."
2007-04-05,"The 15 British sailors and marines prepare to leave Iran after their ' mandatory holiday ' , as President Ahmadinejad put it .
Photograph : STR / AP As "" gifts "" - to use Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's word - go
, it was about as magnanimous as being offered something at a car boot sale you had had pinched the week before .
Nevertheless , there was collective relief in the newspapers , and joy from the families , at Iran 's decision to release the 15 British sailors and marines .
Mr Ahmadinejad surprised rolling news channels and , apparently , British diplomats , too , by announcing the release towards the end of a lengthy speech .
After criticising Britain and the US "" in vintage fashion "" , as the Guardian 's man in Tehran , Robert Tait , put it , and holding a medal ceremony - which included a kiss - for the Revolutionary Guard members who captured the sailors , the Iranian president pulled off "" the theatrical flourish , the rabbit up his showman 's sleeve "" .
"" On the occasion of the birthday of the great prophet [ Muhammad ] ... and for the occasion of the passing of Christ , I say the Islamic Republic government and the Iranian people ... forgive those 15 , "" Tait translates .
Mr Ahmadinejad , whose fortunes have waned politically in Iran in recent months , then delivered his second flourish , meeting the British captives and telling one , "" in a display of mischievous humour ... '
[ S]o , you came on a mandatory vacation . '
"" The photos of the captured personnel , the men dressed in suits and open neck shirts - some smiling and waving , others appearing to do their utmost not to do either - is just the latest curious aspect of a very curious affair .
The group , including the one woman , Faye Turney , in a hijab , look about as comfortable as a team of footballers at a Downing Street party - but without the booze .
"" I went to Iran and all I got was this lousy suit , "" is the Sun 's headline . ""
Freedom ! "" screams the Mail .
But the paper still has plenty of questions : "" Were they in Iranian waters ?
What deals were done ?
Has this been a diplomatic triumph for Blair or a humiliation for Britain ? ""
"" Britain was left looking weak and vulnerable in the Gulf after being outplayed and out - thought by Iran , "" says the paper 's news story .
The Mail columnist Stephen Glover concurs .
"" This is an enormous propaganda victory for the Iranian regime , "" he writes . ""
However much the Foreign Office may congratulate itself for its quiet and allegedly tenacious diplomacy , it has been Iran that has stage - managed these events , from the moment the hostages were seized until the moment they were let go . ""
The Guardian notes that the release came two hours after the US signalled it would let Iranian diplomats visit five Iranians captured by the Americans in Iraq in January .
An Iranian diplomat kidnapped in Baghdad was also released yesterday , fuelling further speculation about diplomacy "" enveloped in fog "" , as the paper puts it .
The foreign secretary , Margaret Beckett , has won praise from the Iranians , the Guardian goes on , for being "" fair and diplomatic "" , in contrast to Downing Street 's "" arrogance "" .
The Telegraph disagrees , describing Mrs Beckett 's calls to the Iranian foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , as "" largely useless "" . ""
He appeared to know little about the situation , "" the paper says .
It says the efforts of Sir Nigel Sheinwald , Tony Blair 's foreign policy adviser , who held talks with Ali Larijani , Iran 's chief nuclear negotiator , on Tuesday night , produced the breakthrough . ""
In his 31-year diplomatic career , Sir Nigel has never held a posting in the Middle East , let alone mastered Persian , "" the Telegraph 's David Blair writes . ""
The Foreign Office could doubtless have supplied many officials with both these qualifications .
But Sir Nigel had something his former colleagues at the Foreign Office lack .
He has the ear of the prime minister , giving him the authority to be Iran 's most credible interlocutor . ""

2007-04-05,"The release of the 15 Britons was a "" gift "" to the British people to celebrate the birth of the prophet Muhammad and Easter , according to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
It also came two hours after an American general revealed the US might allow Iranian diplomats to visit five countrymen arrested in Iraq three months ago .
The timing has fuelled speculation of a deal to free the British sailors and marines seized by Iranian Revolutionary Guards .
In a further coincidence , yesterday 's unexpected announcement came a day after the mysterious release of another Iranian diplomat , Jalal Sharafi , kidnapped in Baghdad at the beginning of the year by gunmen in Iraqi government uniforms .
The 13-day crisis was enveloped in a fog of secret diplomacy and informal talks .
The Syrians claim to have played a leading role in persuading Iran of the foolishness in detaining the Britons any longer .
Iran 's decision may have been the culmination of many reasons , but observers say Tehran must have been convinced it was in its interests to give up its bargaining chips .
The existence of a deal was denied by all involved .
George Bush insisted there would be no "" quid pro quo "" .
British officials said they had Iranian assurances a prisoner swap was not on the agenda , and President Ahmadinejad was adamant the release was for "" humanitarian reasons "" .
Yesterday the Iraqi foreign minister , who appears to have played a critical go - between role , added his voice to the chorus of denial . ""
The British media are linking it as if it is part of bargain with Iran to release the British sailors and marines .
It has no connection whatsoever "" , Hoshyar Zebari told The Guardian yesterday .
Mr Zebari said he had asked the US military to grant consular access to the Iranian diplomats ( known as the "" Irbil five "" after the town in which they were arrested ) in a bid to "" ease the atmosphere "" between Iran and the US at the time of last month 's Baghdad security conference .
The US military spokesman , Major General William Caldwell said authorities were considering the request for access .
A source close to the Revolutionary Guards gave a different account .
The fate of the Irbil five was not a motive for the capture , he said , but it did become a negotiating point after the event .
"" Officially there is no swap .
But there should not be a double standard .
You want access [ to your prisoners ] .
We want access [ to ours ] . ""
He provided the first comprehensive Iranian version of events on March 23 when the 15 Britons were captured by Revolutionary Guard sailors on the shallow seas of the northern Gulf .
Not only had the British patrol strayed into Iranian waters , he claimed , but it was at least the fourth such incursion in three months .
"" They came to our waters before ... at least three times , "" the Iranian source said .
"" We gave them notice that you should n't be .
We did n't use aggressive methods .
We did n't shoot [ across the British bows ] .
Both sides know the sensitive atmosphere .
""
The source explained that the Britons had been captured by low - ranking Revolutionary Guards , but once arrested , their release required intervention on a higher level .
That was delayed by the No Rouz ( new year ) holidays which only ended on Tuesday .
"" Junior people got them , but only senior people could let them go , and they can only let them go after an investigation , "" he said .
During No Rouz , he added , "" everyone is in the villages and mobile phones do n't work there . ""
The US refusal to exclude the use of military force against Iran to stop its nuclear programme , together with a series of separatist attacks in Iran 's border regions had put the Revolutionary Guard on alert for incursions .
"" They are on a yellow state of readiness , "" the source said .
"" We do n't believe the British intent is to start a war , but America has said it is on the table . ""
The investigation into the incident would have run its course and the Britons would have been released , but the affair was complicated by Tony Blair 's decision to take the matter to the UN security council last Wednesday , he added .
Analysts in Tehran said the British crew provided a convenient tool for the Iranian government at a time it was casting around for a means to strike back against an Anglo - American policy of isolation .
Iran 's leadership had become alarmed about UN sanctions over its nuclear programme as well as the seizure of diplomats and operatives in Iraq .
Wary of striking at the US directly , the Iranians saw the sailors as an opportunity to humiliate Britain .
"" Iran was seeking the chance to get something out of Britain , "" said Mohammad Atrianfar , a commentator with close ties to moderate figures in the Iranian regime .
"" The issue is n't important militarily but it has been useful politically . ""
The return of Mr Sharafi to Iran on Tuesday and the prospect of access to the Irbil five strengthened the hand of President Ahmadinejad , according to Issa Saharkhiz , another political analyst .
The Britons ' televised "" confessions "" have served an internal political purpose - convincing a sceptical public that Iran is threatened by a determined enemy ."
2007-04-06,"My husband and the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , are pretty dissimilar in most respects , but they do have two things in common .
The first is a belief that there are certain jobs to which women are less suited than men ; and the second is their desire to develop a nuclear arsenal .
Actually , come to think of it , they may just have the one thing in common , and even then the reality is that my husband has no problem with women in general performing certain tasks ; he just thinks that he does them better than me .
The main dispute in our house does not concern a woman 's suitability for active combat either , but rather who is better at organising meals for large numbers of guests , so I 'm uncomfortably aware that the Ahmadinejad comparison is starting to look a bit thin .
What I 'm driving at is that the old chestnut of feminine inequality - what jobs should a woman not be allowed to perform - keeps on raising its head .
The papers have been full of President Ahmadinejad 's swipe at western values in allowing Faye Turney to leave her child for the navy , but many on the same day carried the story of another woman entering uncharted and choppy waters and facing the wrath of unwelcoming men .
Alexandra Hai has become the first woman - and to add insult to injury , the first foreigner - to be allowed to pilot a gondola in Venice .
I use that rather awkward construction advisedly , because technically she can not be referred to as "" a gondolier "" , but given that she now has the legal right to steer a low - slung , highly decorated black and gold boat around the canals of Venice at a cost of roughly a thousand euros per centimetre , the lack of a title seems academic .
When you start to research its recent history , the serenity of the gondola trade is deceptive .
Every other year , it seems , there 's a threatened strike , or an attempt to ban motorised craft because they increase the swell , or a furore about certain gondoliers chopping off the curly gold tails of their boats because they make it tricky getting under low bridges .
There 's been a long - running argument over gangs of gondoliers clogging the narrow waterways by sailing in convoy to accommodate those large groups of tourists who all want to hear O Sole Mio indifferently performed by the same person at the same time .
And there was the reluctant admission by the Venetian authorities that it 's impossible to know how many gondoliers at any one time are operating drunk .
My own memories of the two gondola trips I have enjoyed only maintain their golden tinge when I choose to forget the whiffy water , traffic jams and risk of whiplash caused by repeated bashing against ancient palazzo walls .
So does it really matter , in the great scheme of things , whether your driver is female ?
After all , she 's promised to keep her boat clean and never wear jeans .
On this one matter , it may surprise you to learn , I agree with the male gondoliers .
I happen to think , feminist though I am , that a gondolier should be an Italian man .
But that 's not a matter of principal , nor a doubt about Ms Hai having the necessary skill .
She may have failed her test the first three times , but that 's not a female weakness .
My husband failed his driving test three times too , while I passed mine straight away - which is quite irrelevant to this piece , of course , but gives me another chance for a cheap jibe .
It 's just that if you fancy pushing the boat out , taking a gondola trip in Venice is one of the most romantic experiences one could enjoy .
For me , that romance would be dimmed by replacing the obligatory Italian crooner in a stripey jersey with a German woman not wearing jeans .
And if that attitude shocks you , wait till I tell you about my nuclear weapons programme ...

2007-04-06,"When Argentine forces surrounded Government House in Stanley , 25 years ago this week , Enoch Powell criticised the British marines for surrendering , rather than fighting to their last bullet .
His desire for pointless sacrifice to salvage national glory from defeat found a depressing echo this week in the outburst of resentment against the 15 sailors and marines captured and then released by Iran .
It was expressed most strongly in the Daily Mail , which complained yesterday that they had been "" grovellingly acquiescent "" in everything from their appearance with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to their acceptance of gifts of pistachio nuts and floral bags .
The clear and intelligent explanations given by seven of the captured men at yesterday 's gripping press conference squashed such ignorant and premature criticism .
The group 's treatment - and the way they were used to further Iran 's propaganda interests - verged on the grotesque .
They seem to have behaved both honourably and rationally .
Their captors did neither .
Their evidence may build public outrage about the incident , which has been strangely lacking until now .
But initial resentment at the perfectly proper way in which the group behaved was perhaps really part of a wider public resentment at Britain 's whole involvement in Iraq , and what has gone wrong there .
Yesterday even the giant union jack pinned up behind the group could not hide the fact that Iraq has been a British defeat and that this episode has been part of it .
But if Britain has lost , it is because of politicians and the battles they have chosen to fight , not the performance of the armed services .
The army , which has borne the brunt of the conflict in Iraq and in Afghanistan , has undergone a huge change since the end of the cold war .
Tony Blair - who came to office wondering whether British forces would ever fight again - has used the military to support a sweeping vision of national interest that has little to do with old certainties , or even the patriotic pressures that sent the taskforce to the Falklands .
In Kosovo , Sierra Leone , Iraq and Afghanistan British forces have ended up fighting in conflicts that make a nonsense of nostalgic cries for captured British troops to reserve their response to name , rank and serial number .
Warfare , in the form that the government has chosen over the last decade , has made much wider demands on loyalties and skills - and in the main , the armed forces have responded impressively .
The articulate statements at yesterday 's press conference stand in contrast to the sullen silence of ministers such as Margaret Beckett .
The military , unlike reactionary commentators this week , have also come to terms with a world in which it is natural that men and women serve together .
The fact that one woman was among those held in Iran , and two women were among the six soldiers killed in Basra this week , makes the point , if bleakly .
Changing politics at home may make the deployment of British forces abroad less routine in the next decade than it became in the last .
But the military will remain a far larger part of British life than many would have guessed when the Berlin wall fell .
A recent YouGov poll found strong support for Britain reducing its military role in the world and suggested that most parents do not want their children to join up .
But this week the army released figures showing recruitment 11 % higher than last year .
What , in the future , will these forces to do ?
The challenge is one for policy makers , more than soldiers .
The captured men and women in the Gulf , like soldiers in Basra , have borne the brunt of an interventionist foreign policy which has failed .
But isolation would be dangerous , even if it were possible .
Between a narrow doctrine of national interest , and Mr Blair 's haphazard lunging at demons , can a middle way be found for military philosophy : an enlightened balance between internationalism and an awareness of Britain 's limits ?"
2007-04-07,"An Iranian diplomat who was freed last week , two months after being seized in Iraq , said yesterday that he had been tortured by the CIA while in captivity at an Iraqi government installation .
The claims by Jalal Sharafi on Iranian state television will lead to fresh speculation that the diplomat was freed as part of a deal to secure Wednesday 's release of 15 British servicemen seized by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard .
The allegations also come amid continuing political fall - out over the two - week hostage crisis in both London and Tehran , with both Iran 's President , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and Prime Minister Tony Blair being criticised for their behaviour during the stand - off .
While Sharafi 's claims are very similar to those made by the servicemen on their return to Britain , the recent US history of renditions , kidnapping and abuse make them difficult to ignore .
Although US officials denied yesterday any role in Sharafi 's abduction , his release has led inevitably to suspicion that it was part of a secret deal that has also seen US forces grant access to five other detained Iranians in Iraq .
Sharafi was kidnapped in February by gunmen wearing Iraqi army uniforms .
When he was released on Tuesday , Iraq 's Foreign Minister , Hoshyar Zebari , said the diplomat was in good health but ' did not know who had held him ' .
Sharafi , however , says he was abducted by agents bearing Iraqi Defence Ministry ID cards .
He said he was taken to a base near Baghdad airport , where he was questioned in Arabic and English . '
Questions asked by CIA agents were about the presence and influence of Iran in Iraq .
They asked questions about the amount of aid Iran provided to the government of [ Iraqi Prime Minister ] al - Maliki , Shia , Sunni and Kurdish groups , ' he said . '
When they were faced with my answers about the official relationship of Iran with the Iraqi government and officials , they increased the tortures .
Many days they tortured me day and night , ' he said .
And as Britain and Iran continued to swap accusations , evidence was emerging in Tehran that both conservative and reformist Iranians were increasingly disillusioned with Ahmadinejad , arguing that the televised scenes of the Iranian President personally greeting the bemused Britons moments after announcing their release had brought ridicule on the country 's Islamic system .
A fundamentalist MP , Emad Afrough - chairman of the Iranian parliament 's powerful cultural committee - denounced the performance as ' inappropriate ' : ' It is not befitting for any government that the entire cabinet bids farewell to 15 military personnel who had hitherto been recognised as invaders of Iran 's territorial waters , ' he told The Observer The criticism was echoed by Saeed Leylaz , a pro - reformist commentator , who said : ' The origin of this show has been the humiliation of the country of Iran .
You capture people and then you send them out with suits , shirts , sweets and gifts to take back to Britain .
It 's embarrassing . '
Ahmadinejad - who has come under pressure over Iran 's worsening economy - was thought at first to have wrong - footed his critics with the theatrically staged ceremony last Wednesday .
The political fall - out was not limited to Iran .
In London , too , friction has emerged between Downing Street and the Foreign Office amid claims that the tougher line taken by Tony Blair may have delayed the release of woman sailor Faye Turney .
Margaret Beckett , the foreign secretary , has faced accusations that she was sidelined during the drama , leaving the Prime Minister 's foreign policy adviser , Nigel Sheinwald , to make the real breakthrough .
However , this weekend friends insisted the Foreign Office 's ' softly - softly ' approach had paid off .
Whitehall sources disclosed that the parading of Turney had backfired on Iran in the Arab world , costing it the support of Muslim countries who believed it was wrong for a woman to be held captive .
Syria was among influential neighbours that helped pressure Iran into releasing the sailors , while the Turkish Prime Minister also interceded on Britain 's behalf ."
2007-04-09,"Iran 's president today claimed his country was capable of ' industrial scale ' enrichment of uranium , expanding a key nuclear process that the United Nations has demanded it halt .
The announcement by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at a ceremony at the enrichment facility at Natanz came as Iran 's nuclear negotiator , Ali Larijani , confirmed Iran had begun enriching uranium with 3,000 centrifuges .
Until now , Iran was only known to have 328 centrifuges operating .
Mr Larijani did not give further details about the advances at the facility , and it remains unclear at what stage Iran 's programme is at .
Experts say the Natanz plant needs between 50,000 and 60,000 centrifuges to consistently produce fuel for a reactor or build a warhead .
The US and its allies accuse Iran of intending to produce weapons - a charge Tehran denies .
The Vienna - based International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , the UN nuclear watchdog , had no immediate comment to today 's announcement .
Mr Ahmadinejad was at a ceremony to celebrate the one - year anniversary of its first success in enriching small amounts of uranium .
A year ago today Iran announced it had first enriched uranium using an array of 164 centrifuges .
The unveiling of new centrifuges at Natanz , which is in central Iran , is strong show of defiance toward the United Nations , which has imposed limited sanctions on Iran until it suspends enrichment .
The UN security council has vowed to ratchet up sanctions as long as Iran rejects an enrichment suspension , and has set a new deadline of late May for Tehran to do so .
Today in his speech , Mr Ahmadinejad said the door to negotiations with the west remains open , and that Iran "" welcomes any suggestion and dialogue to resolve the issues "" .
He insisted Iran has been cooperative with the IAEA , allowing it inspections of its facilities , but he warned : "" Do n't do something that will make this great nation reconsider its policies "" - a reference to the threat of increased UN sanctions . ""
With great honour , I declare that as of today our dear country has joined the nuclear club of nations and can produce nuclear fuel on an industrial scale , "" Mr Ahmadinejad said .
Mr Larijani said his country was willing to offer assurances that its programme was peaceful but he said the west must accept the programme as a fact .
The IAEA says it has gaps in its knowledge about Iran 's nuclear plans that must be filled before it can say they are peaceful .
The watchdog is also pushing Tehran to agree to let it install cameras in the underground section of Natanz to monitor Iran 's work .
Iran says such intrusive surveillance goes beyond its basic safeguards commitment to the IAEA .
Tensions are also high between Iran and the west following the 13-day detention of 15 British sailors by Iran .
The sailors and marines , who were seized by revolutionary guards off the Iraqi coast , were released last Wednesday .
They say they were put under psychological pressure by their captors to force them to "" confess "" to being in Iranian waters when captured .
In Tehran today , some 200 students formed a human chain at Iran 's Atomic Energy Organisation while chanting "" death to America "" and "" death to Britain . ""
The students burnt flags of the US and Britain ."
2007-04-10,"Iran claimed yesterday to have made a dramatic leap forward in its nuclear programme by enriching uranium "" on an industrial scale "" , a move likely to accelerate a collision with the US and strengthen calls in Washington for military action .
In a gesture of defiance to President George Bush and the UN security council , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad trumpeted the claim , making the announcement with pomp and ceremony at the heart of Iran 's nuclear programme , the uranium enrichment facility at Natanz .
Mr Ahmadinejad claimed "" the Iranian nation had joined the group of countries who enriched uranium on an industrial scale "" , but did not specify what that entailed .
Iran 's top diplomat , Ari Larijani , said the country had 3,000 centrifuges capable of processing uranium to make either low enriched fuel for generating electricity or - as the west fears - highly - enriched material for a warhead .
Before an audience that included his cabinet , senior mullahs and dozens of foreign ambassadors , Mr Ahmadinejad warned security council members that Iran would "" reconsider its treatment towards them "" if they continued to oppose its nuclear ambitions .
"" They have seen again and again that our nation is powerful enough to do that , "" he said to chants of "" death to Britain "" , "" death to America "" and "" death to Israel "" .
"" I advise them to observe the legal rights of different nations and stop monopolising , because that will not be to their benefit . ""
Whatever the truth of the Iranian claims , there was no mistaking the disdain shown for two mild sanctions packages passed by the security council so far , and the threat of more if Iran does not cease uranium enrichment by May 24 .
There are also voices inside the Bush administration and the Israeli government calling for military action before Iran acquires the capacity to build a bomb .
Yesterday 's ceremony will have strengthened their claims that diplomacy and UN sanctions are having no effect .
Sean McCormack , a spokesman for the US state department , said the international community did not "" believe Iran 's assurances that their programme is peaceful in nature "" .
The White House said it was "" very concerned "" that Tehran had started industrial atomic work .
In London , the Foreign Office said Britain might use its presidency of the security council this month to discuss Iran 's new claims , as well as the 13-day hostage crisis involving the 15 UK service personnel .
The latest UN sanctions package , passed unanimously by the security council on March 24 , included a ban on Iranian arms exports and the freezing of assets of several leaders of the revolutionary guard and Iran 's fifth biggest bank .
British and US officials have suggested that the pressure so far has opened fissures in Tehran over the wisdom of its nuclear drive .
Scientists believe that with 3,000 centrifuges operating smoothly and continually , Iran would have enough highly enriched uranium for a bomb within nine months .
However , nuclear analysts in the US and Britain say the Iranian leadership may be exaggerating its progress .
They question whether Iranian scientists have mastered spinning such a large number of the very delicate machines at once .
"" I think it 's a boast , "" Mark Fitzpatrick , a former US state department expert on non - proliferation who is now at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London , said .
"" I do n't believe they have 3,000 centrifuges running in Natanz .
There 's not been any evidence yet they can even run test cascades [ arrays of centrifuges ] in a continuous manner . ""
The UN estimate is that the Iranians have installed only 1,000 centrifuges so far in Natanz and have not yet started enriching uranium with them .
UN inspectors are due to visit the site this month to check .
Mr Ahmadinejad went out of his way to project national unity and determination yesterday .
The televised ceremony featured nationalistic songs played live by an orchestra .
Journalists were bused to the event , passing anti - aircraft missile batteries on the approaches to the site in central Iran .
It marked the anniversary of last year 's announcement that Iran had achieved its nuclear fuel cycle , a development that raised tensions with the west .
Mr Ahmadinejad said Iran was on course to produce 20,000 MW of nuclear - generated electricity and would not be deterred by the UN .
"" Our peaceful programme is a test for the security council , particularly its permanent members , "" he said .
"" Their decision shows how far they are committed to observing international and national rights and upholding justice . ""
Mohamed ElBaradei , director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency , the UN 's atomic watchdog , predicted last month that Iran would achieve industrial capacity in uranium this summer .
It is a moment experts at the IAEA feared as a potential point of no return , because it puts the country within reach of making a warhead .
"" It is capacity that is the proliferation risk , not the know - how itself , "" said one IAEA diplomat .
The agency acknowledges it has no proof that Iran is seeking to make a bomb , but says Tehran has not been entirely forthcoming with information in many areas .
In its last report in March , it said Iran had stopped the agency 's 24-hour surveillance of the Natanz enrichment plant ."
2007-04-10,"President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's claim that Iran was capable of enriching uranium on an industrial scale was greeted with scepticism yesterday .
Industrial scale is shorthand for 3,000 centrifuges , linked up and spinning uranium hexafluoride gas at supersonic speeds continuously .
The consensus is that Iran would be lucky to have a third of that number of centrifuges working properly .
Experts also doubt whether continuous operation has been achieved - another key part of the calculation .
Three thousand centrifuges operating smoothly in tandem would produce enough enriched uranium to produce one bomb in a year .
Yesterday two UN inspectors arrived at Natanz , the plant where the enrichment is taking place , and will report back to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna .
The inspectors will eventually get to the truth of Iran 's claims , but it will also take time before their information is released , even to the Americans .
Yet two messages come through loud and clear from Natanz , where Mr Ahmadinejad made his triumphalist announcement .
The first is that Iran will not be bullied , pressured or otherwise browbeaten into abandoning its enrichment programme .
The country not only has the capability to enrich the uranium it claims it needs only for its civilian nuclear fuel cycle ; it also has the political will .
No number of US aircraft carriers deployed off Iran 's shores would deter us from doing so , the president is saying .
The second message is that the price of a bargain with the outside world has just gone up .
Each fresh cascade of centrifuges on stream gives Tehran a stronger hand .
As Sir John Thomson , the former British ambassador to the UN , said recently , in pursuing its strategy of ratcheting up pressure on Iran the west is running out of not only time but options .
Even if Mr Ahmadinejad was exaggerating , there is little doubt that Iran will eventually get a nuclear capability , as India and Pakistan did .
Failure of the current sanctions strategy would leave the west with an unenviable choice : either let Mr Ahmadinejad get the nuclear material he could use for a bomb , or attack the plants such as Natanz that produce enriched uranium .
If , as the Oxford Research Group has claimed , it is the case that bombing Natanz could hasten an Iranian bomb ( because you ca n't bomb the knowledge that Iranian scientists have gained , and getting a nuclear bomb after an attack would become a national imperative ) , that leaves only one option : changing Iranian behaviour through cooperation and negotiation .
Continue on the current course and Iran could pull out of the nuclear non - proliferation treaty , as it has hinted that it would do .
In that case even two UN inspectors would not be able to fulfil their modest task .
Nothing taking place at Natanz and other sites is actually illegal , as long as it is for civilian use .
The problem is that it could also be for military use .
The goal of negotiators should to be increase , not decrease , the transparency of Iran 's civil nuclear programme , and the ability of international inspectors to monitor it .
Even if the destruction of every centrifuge and every nuclear scientist could be guaranteed in an air strike , which it can not , nothing could then persuade the Iranian leadership to give up .
On the contrary , a US air strike would guarantee the regime the popular support that it can only dream about today .
There are goals that negotiators could aim for , other than the unilateral suspension of all enrichment activity before any talks can take place .
One suggestion is an enrichment process that takes place physically on Iranian soil but under multilateral ownership and supervision .
There may be other ways of satisfying both Iran 's claim for a nuclear cycle and our desire to stop it getting the bomb .
But one thing is clear : the current policy is not working and we should heed Iran 's claims for what they are - warning signals ."
2007-04-12,"With its enduring relics of a glorious imperial past , spectacular glittering mosques and breathtaking landscapes , Iran lays claim to some of the finest cultural jewels in the Middle East .
But a potentially catastrophic collapse in the country 's tourist trade is threatening to leave this dazzling array of attractions largely unseen by foreign eyes , as international tensions with the west deter a growing number of overseas visitors .
The problem has been exacerbated by the recent detention of 15 British marines and sailors , which prompted mass cancellations of foreign tours to a land described this week by its president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , as a cradle of civilisation .
Fears of military conflict over Iran 's nuclear programme and disquiet over Mr Ahmadinejad 's infamous remarks on the Holocaust had already caused a sharp decline in the number of affluent western visitors , a vital source of foreign currency in a struggling economy .
Now industry insiders say the problem has reached crisis levels .
Even before the sailors ' crisis , Iranian travel agents were staggering under the burden of declining foreign trade .
One of Tehran 's leading travel agents recently laid off 70 workers due to the fall - off .
Mohammad Hassan Kermani , director of Iran 's federation of travel agents , said the 13-day stand - off between London and Tehran had compounded the trend and caused the cancellation of all previously - booked European tour groups until 2009 .
He said foreign governments were advising their citizens not to visit Iran , with long - term consequences for an industry that employs an estimated 2.5 million Iranians .
"" What is happening today to Iran 's tourist industry is not a few days or few months damage , and we must acknowledge that foreign tourists have cancelled all their tours until 2009 .
Until future notice they have no interest in travelling to this country , "" Mr Kermani told the newspaper Etemad - e Melli . ""
Fears of coming here were reinforced by the sailors ' detention and travelling tours were cancelled .
It indicates a crisis in Iran 's tourism industry and it is inflicting irreparable damage .
"" The decline is an embarrassment to the government , which last year offered travel agents £ 10 for every European and American tourist they brought to Iran and £ 5 for tourists from elsewhere .
The head of the nation 's tourism organisation , Efandiyar Rahim - Mashai , promised recently to build "" more five - star hotels than the eye can count "" .
Most major hotels in Iran are run by government - affiliated foundations .
The main international chains withdrew after the 1979 Islamic revolution .
After years of stagnation , tourism underwent a modest boom under the reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami , who encouraged it by advocating a "" dialogue between civilisations "" .
Tour groups poured in to sites such as Persepolis , the seat of Iran 's 2,500-year - old Achaemenid dynasty , and Isfahan , home of the 16th century Safavid dynasty and hailed in Persian folklore as representing "" half the world "" .
Visitors were also drawn by Iran 's wealth of archaeological treasures stemming from its 7,000-year - old civilisation .
Tourism chiefs responded by abolishing inflated entrance tariffs for foreigners , though most hotels still charge foreigners up to double the price for Iranians .
The deputy head of Iran 's tourism and cultural heritage organisation , Mohammad Sharif Malekzadeh , yesterday denied that there had been wholesale cancellations .
But Taghi Aghaei , owner of the Ziggurat Tour and Travel company - responsible for bringing the first US tourists to Iran after the revolution - said the nuclear dispute and Mr Ahmadinejad 's rhetoric had reversed the recovery from the post-9/11 slump .
"" When we object to the authorities that tourism can create more jobs and that 2.5 million people in Iran depend on it , they say , come on , we have major strategic problems here and you are complaining about tourism , "" he said .
"" The sailors ' issue is over but the nuclear case is having a bad impact and if sanctions worsen , we face even more cancellations .
"" Most European visitors to Iran come from Germany , France , Austria and Britain .
Modest numbers also visit from America and Canada , although numbers declined sharply after 9/11 .
However , travel agents say the foreign market has always been fragile and subject to sudden cancellations because of political and safety issues .
""
Six or seven years ago we would be talking to a travel agency in , say , Frankfurt , about bringing a group of German tourists over then there would be some issue about the safety of Iranian hotels and the deal would be cancelled at the last minute , "" said Akbar Ahmadi , managing director of the Khorasan Travel Agency .
"" Issues such as the nuclear case and the sailors are obviously much bigger , so you can see how it will damage trade .
Large - scale cancellations will have a devastating effect .

2007-04-16,"It is , rather grandly , titled ' The First Law of Petropolitics ' - as oil prices climb , so political freedoms in major oil producing nations diminish .
It was coined last year by US uber - columnist Thomas L. Friedman in Foreign Policy magazine , and expanded in a lengthier article yesterday for the New York Times .
In the first piece , he explained his basic reasoning thus : When I heard the president of Iran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , declare that the Holocaust was a ' myth ' , I could n't help asking myself : ' I wonder if the president of Iran would be talking this way if the price of oil were $ 20 a barrel today rather than $ 60 a barrel ? '
While not pretending to be rigorous science - "" I am not trying to get tenure anywhere , "" he insisted -
Mr Friedman illustrated his article with charts plotting civil and political rights in major petro - nations as determined by so - called "" freedom indexes "" produced by US thinktanks , against oil prices .
The inverse relationship is striking .
He added anecdotal evidence , for example pointing out that not only was Bahrain the first Gulf state to hold free elections , among other reforms , but also the first such state expected to run out of oil .
And did Ronald Reagan bring down the Soviet Union ?
Nonsense , Mr Friedman suggested ; of far more impact was low oil prices , hovering around $ 17 a barrel when the bloc formally dissolved in late 1991 .
In yesterday 's expanded think piece , Mr Friedman calls for a "" Green New Deal "" reducing America 's dependence on oil and thus cutting global demand and prices .
George Bush 's current refusal to make major steps towards curbing oil use leaves the US not only dependent on illiberal regimes but also ends up financing the very radical Islamist elements he is supposedly battling , Mr Friedman argues , cheekily calling it "" a policy of ' No Mullah Left Behind ' "" .
The arguments are clear , he says : People change when they have to - not when we tell them to - and falling oil prices make them have to .
That is why if we are looking for a Plan B for Iraq - a way of pressing for political reform in the Middle East without going to war again - there is no better tool than bringing down the price of oil .
Of course , it 's perfectly possible to argue that The First Law of Petropolitics is simply a very specific example of a universal political law - a well - fed , economically sated population rarely erupts in revolt .
However , Mr Friedman 's notion is an interesting way to approach modern geo - politics .
Yesterday 's article also goes further and predicts that a green revolution in the US is on its way .
As an example , he notes that the US army is pushing for more energy - efficient technologies to reduce its reliance on vulnerable fuel supply chains , adding : Pay attention : When the US army desegregated , the country really desegregated ; when the army goes green , the country could really go green ."
2007-04-18,"Iran 's army will "" cut off the hand "" of any attacker , the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , said during an annual military parade today .
In a typically defiant speech to mark national army day , Mr Ahmadinjad played down the effect of UN sanctions over the country 's nuclear programme , and said its military was self - sufficient . ""
Some bullying powers imagined that by implementing sanctions they would weaken our army , [ but ] today our army is self - sufficient and secures its needs in general , "" he said .
In a televised address , he said the army "" stands against any aggressor and will cut off its hand "" .
He made a similar remark at last year 's ceremony , saying Iran would "" cut off the hands of any aggressors "" .
The UN security council has set a deadline of late May for Iran to halt its uranium enrichment programme or face a further toughening of sanctions .
After introducing limited measures in December , the security council last month ratcheted up the pressure , banning Iranian arms exports and freezing the assets of 28 individuals and companies involved in Iran 's nuclear or ballistic missile programmes .
The US has said it wants a diplomatic resolution to the nuclear standoff , but has not ruled out military action if that fails .
It has strengthened its military presence in the region by sending a second aircraft carrier group to the Gulf .
Mr Ahmadinejad delivered his address standing under a large banner declaring : "" Peaceful nuclear technology is an essential need of our country . ""
A military parade following his speech included a parachute drop and the display , for the first time , of a locally manufactured air defence system said to have the capability of simultaneously launching two surface - to - air missiles .
However , Iran did not show off its longest - range missile , the Shahab-3 , which it says can hit targets 1,250 miles away , putting Israel or US bases in the Gulf within range .
Last week , Mr Ahmadinejad said Iran was now enriching nuclear fuel on an "" industrial scale "" - a claim that Mohammed ElBaradei , the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , discounted .
He also warned countries to stop trying to put pressure on Iran to suspend its enrichment of uranium and to accept that Iran 's nuclear programme was "" irreversible "" ."
2007-04-30,"A grand coalition of anti - government forces is planning a second Iranian revolution via the ballot box to deny President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad another term in office and break the grip of what they call the "" militia state "" on public life and personal freedom .
Encouraged by recent successes in local elections , opposition factions , democracy activists , and pro - reform clerics say they will bring together progressive parties loyal to former president Mohammad Khatami with so - called pragmatic conservatives led by Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani .
The alliance aims to exploit the president 's deepening unpopularity , borne of high unemployment , rising inflation and a looming crisis over petrol prices and possible rationing to win control of the Majlis in general elections which are due within 10 months .
Parliament last week voted to curtail Mr Ahmadinejad 's term by holding presidential and parliamentary elections simultaneously next year .
Though the move is likely to be vetoed by the hardline Guardian Council , it served notice of mounting disaffection in parliament .
But opposition spokesmen say their broader objective is to bring down the fundamentalist regime by democratic means , transform Iran into a "" normal country "" , and obviate the need for any military or other US and western intervention .
Rightwing political and religious forces , divided and dismayed by Mr Ahmadinejad 's much - criticised performance , are already mobilising to meet the threat .
The movement amounts to the clearest sign yet within Iran that the country is by no means unified behind a president who has led it into confrontation with the west over the nuclear issue , while presiding over economic decline at home . ""
The past two years have been a very bitter time for Iran , "" said Mohammad Atrianfar , a leading opposition figure with ties to Mr Rafsanjani , the former president now emerging as a likely future kingmaker in Iran . ""
Ahmadinejad has done everything upside down - politics , economy , foreign policy - putting all our achievements at risk .
He has done a lot of damage at home and abroad . ""
Mr Atrianfar said that a majority in the Majlis was now critical of the president and would certainly impeach him but for the support he enjoyed from the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
According to Ali Alavi of Siyasat - e Ruz newspaper , some 150 political activists , governors - general , former administration officials and dissident MPs drew up a coalition "" victory strategy "" at a secretive conference last month presided over by Mr Khatami .
The strategy envisaged "" aggravation of the differences among the fundamentalists "" and "" constant criticism of Ahmadinejad "" by "" presenting a dark image of the country 's affairs , "" Mr Alavi said .
Opposition sources said that a future reformist - pragmatist government would continue to maintain Iran 's claim to nuclear energy and other "" national rights "" but would seek to settle disputes through talks .
Iran wanted a "" normal "" relationship with the rest of the world based on mutual respect , the opposition sources said .
In an oblique swipe at Mr Ahmadinejad , Mr Rafsanjani told the weekly Friday prayer meeting in Tehran that the nuclear issue should be settled by negotiations "" conducted in a rational atmosphere "" .
Mr Atrianfar said the economy was the battleground on which Iran 's political future would be decided .
The president has faced mounting criticism in recent weeks over high unemployment , especially among younger people , rising inflation and escalating housing costs .
Significantly , for a major oil producer , heavily subsidised petrol prices are due to rise next month , hitting poorer people hardest in a country with poor or non - existent public transport .
"" They are playing with fire .
Nobody wants to take responsibility for this .
It 's going to blow up in their faces , "" said Hussein Dirbaz , a resident of Narmak , the Tehran suburb where Mr Ahmadinejad was brought up .
In an unusual intervention , Grand Ayatollah Yusef Sa'anei , one of Iran 's most respected Islamic scholars , has attacked Mr Ahmadinejad 's government for failing to tackle social ills such as youth unemployment , drug addiction , and gender inequality .
In a rare interview with a western newspaper at his office in the holy city of Qom , Mr Sa'anei said : "" The government should be at the service of the people .
But it is putting too much pressure on the people .
"" It bans newspapers , sends people to jail , segregates boys and the girls at the universities , makes noise about hijab . ""
A senior government official said the rising tide of criticism directed at Mr Ahmadinejad was unwarranted .
"" People say we do n't care but that 's not true .
We 've created more credit , more jobs .
"" It 's too soon to say [ Ahmadinejad ] has failed .
It 's too soon to say the reformists will win . ""
Observers claim that a power struggle is inevitable . ""
A very big battle is coming .
It 's unavoidable , "" a western diplomat said .
"" There 's a widening gulf between the two sides .
There are profound divisions about which way Iran should go .
It 's going to get very rough . ""
The looming power struggle could decide whether Iran continues on a path of confrontation with the west or comes in from the cold , the diplomat said ."
2007-05-10,"The mayor of Tehran has been re - elected in a vote seen as a victory for moderate conservatives in Iran and a sign of waning support for the country 's hardline president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Mayor Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf is considered a likely rival to Mr Ahmadinejad in the 2009 presidential election .
"" This is an important event .
It shows that conservatives are distancing themselves from radicals headed by Ahmadinejad , "" said Saeed Laylaz , an Iranian political analyst and columnist , yesterday .
Mr Qalibaf is a conservative who backs the Islamic regime , but also a pragmatist who has stressed efficiency over hardline ideology in running Tehran .
The mayor 's re - election is regarded as a reflection of pragmatic conservatives ' increasing discontent with Mr Ahmadinejad 's harsh anti - Western rhetoric and his failure to improve Iran 's weak economy .
Tehran city council members were under tremendous pressure from the government not to vote for Mr Qalibaf , who won the backing of eight of the council 's 15 members .
Mohsen Mirdamadi , the leader of Iran 's largest reformist party , said Mr Ahmadinejad 's allies pushed council members to elect any other candidate - even a more liberal one - rather than Mr Qalibaf .
Mr Ahmadinejad was the previous mayor of Tehran and used the high - profile post as a stepping stone to win the presidential election - and political analysts believe he is clearly worried Mr Qalibaf could do the same .
Mr Qalibaf 's efforts to modernise Tehran 's administration have appealed to Iranians seeking greater efficiency in the city .
He has completed construction of expressways and tunnels , improved the subway and expanded green areas and public parks .
And he has pushed ahead on the construction of a cinema , even though it is frowned on by hardliners .
Although he supports Iran 's clerical leadership , Mr Qalibaf has not pushed an agenda of Islamic rules .
Female staff at the Tehran municipality have not been forced to wear the chador , a head - to - toe robe that is the most conservative of Islamic dress . ""
Qalibaf 's record as Tehran mayor indicates his skill in strategic management , something that has rarely been applied in the capital , "" said Mohammad Khoshchehreh , a conservative lawmaker who campaigned for Ahmadinejad in 2005 but later became a vocal critic .
Mr Qalibaf , 46 , ran in the last presidential election but did not make it to the runoff .
However , he could be Mr Ahmadinejad 's strongest opponent in the election expected in June 2009 .
Former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , one of the country 's most powerful politicians , lost in 2005 and the 72-year - old may not run again because of his age .
As head of Iran 's national police before becoming mayor in 2005 , Mr Qalibaf won praise for dealing peacefully with pro - democracy student protests .
Unlike his predecessors , he did not put down the demonstrations and restrained hardline vigilantes who are often unleashed against protesters ."
2007-05-23,"Iran is to introduce petrol rationing in two weeks in a move that belies its status as the world 's fourth largest oil exporter and threatens to trigger a popular backlash against its president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The country 's motorists — used to some of the cheapest fuel in the world — will be restricted to three litres a day under a scheme to cut fuel consumption and reduce the burden on Iran 's struggling economy of providing subsidised petrol .
The development risks provoking popular discontent among a population already restive over rising prices amid an inflation rate estimated at 20 % to 30 % .
It also contradicts Mr Ahmadinejad 's pre - election promise to reduce poverty and bring Iran 's oil wealth to "" people 's tables "" .
But the president is being pushed to act to plug large budget deficit caused by fuel subsidies , along with fears that spiralling demand could exhaust Iran 's oil - exporting capacity within 15 years .
The ration plan , earmarked for June 7 , was to start this week but was delayed amid difficulties in smart card technology at filling stations .
Worries over political consequences have prompted speculation that the scheme may be postponed indefinitely .
However , the government had already upset motorists by announcing on Tuesday that a litre of petrol would go up by 1p to 5p , triggering long queues at the pumps as motorists rushed to buy before the rise took effect .
While tiny by western standards , the rise is controversial in a country where car ownership has soared in recent years and cheap fuel is taken for granted .
Under rationing , things will get tougher .
Kamal Daneshyar , head of parliament 's energy committee , said drivers would have to pay 20p a litre for petrol above their quota .
Despite producing 4.2 m barrels of crude per day , lack of refinement capacity and rising demand forced Iran to spend more than £ 2bn on imported petrol last year .
A Tehran - based analyst , who requested anonymity , predicted that rationing would trigger further inflation .
But he added : "" This country can not go on consuming and wasting the amount of fuel that it does .
It is one of the top three per capita users of energy in the world .
If we keep going at that rate we will end up consuming all the hydro - carbons we produce .
It has great strategic implications for Iran as an energy exporter . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad 's woes at home were compounded on the international front yesterday when a spokesman at the White House called a new report by the International Atomic Energy Agency into Iran 's nuclear activities "" a laundry list of Iran 's continued defiance of the international and shows that leaders are only furthering the isolation of the Iranian people "" .

Mr Ahmadinejad 's woes at home were compounded overseas yesterday when a spokesman at the White House called a new report by the International Atomic Energy Agency into Iran 's nuclear activities "" a laundry list of Iran 's continued defiance of the international community "" .
Iran had not only ignored a UN security council deadline to stop uranium enrichment activity but had expanded it , according to the IAEA report .
Relations with the US are likely to deteriorate further after reports that Iran has imprisoned another Iranian - American affiliated with George Soros 's Open Society Institute - the fourth dual citizen to be detained in Iran in recent months .
Tehran - based social scientist and urban planner Kian Tajbakhsh was arrested on around May 11 .
Tehran has accused the Soros group of promoting "" soft revolution "" - a term used to refer to a perceived US plot to undermine the Islamic state ."
2007-05-25,"Iran 's financial system suffered a fresh jolt yesterday with panic selling on the stock market after the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , abruptly ordered banks to cut interest rates sharply , despite surging inflation .
The order , which Mr Ahmadinejad issued by telephone during a visit to Belarus and which flew in the face of expert advice - has triggered warnings of a financial crisis and spiralling corruption amid fears of a capital flight from the country 's lending institutions .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's decree forced all state - owned and private banks to slash borrowing rates to 12 % .
Inflation is officially 15 % but is generally believed to be much higher .
State banks had been offering rates of 14 % , while those in the private sector ranged from 17 % to 28 % .
The decision caused panic in the Tehran stock exchange , with private banks losing much of their share value overnight .
Shareholders in one bank , Karafarin , queued on Wednesday to sell their stock when previously there had been 1.2 million applicants to buy its shares .
There was speculation yesterday that the move could force the resignation of the economy minister , Davoud Danesh - Ja'afari , who was not consulted .
Interest rates are normally set by the head of the central bank , who is nominally politically independent .
The Hammihan newspaper carried a picture of a disconsolate - looking Mr Danesh - Ja'afari holding his head in his hand under the headline : Shock on the Tehran bourse .
The rate cut was imposed at the same time as Mr Ahmadinejad raised the price of petrol by 1p to 5p a litre .
That caused anger among motorists , who expected a new rationing system to be introduced on Tuesday .
The government has postponed rationing until next month , citing difficulties in introducing the necessary technology to filling stations .
The interest rate move theoretically helps the less - well - off , for whom Mr Ahmadinejad has pledged support with cheaper loans .
But economists say cutting rates below inflation will scare investors into withdrawing their savings , thereby creating a black market in high interest loans .
They also warn of higher inflation as investors redirect their money into property and push up house prices . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad 's argument is that the lower the interest rate , the more access people will have to money , "" said one analyst .
"" But you ca n't command interest rates down .
They have to match inflation .
To cut rates , the government has to balance its budget better . ""
Another economist , Saeed Leylaz , claimed the move was a reward to powerful groups who had supported Mr Ahmadinejad .
"" I believe the president knows the consequence of this decision but he does n't care about the future . ""
"" There are groups which helped put Mr Ahmadinejad into office and in my opinion , he is paying them back .
In the last two years , the value of ( outstanding ) debts has reached US$ 11bn , compared with $ 3.5bn in the previous 100 years .
Mr Ahmadinejad ordered the banks to pay these accelerated loans to the special groups .
If you cut interest rates , it means they have less to pay back .
You can imagine how disastrous this is to the banking system . """
2007-06-04,"Iran 's interior minister , Moustafa Pourmohammadi , is on the conservative wing of his country 's establishment .
Appointed by the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , this cleric - turned - politician shares his sponsor 's contempt for secular liberalism .
His promotion of the ancient Shia Muslim tradition of temporary marriage is not , therefore , intended to promote a sexual revolution .
Iranian women will remain draped in the robes and head scarves demanded by law .
Public executions and the state persecution of dissidents will persist .
Some Iranian women 's groups have attacked the suggestion , and it would be demented for me to imagine that they understand the likely consequences less well than me .
But it is plain that Mr Pourmohammadi 's endorsement of the "" sigheh "" concept exposes official concern about the political power of Iran 's huge youth population .
He has , after all , explained his disinterment of the concept by reference to the needs of "" a 15-year - old youth into whom God has put lust "" .
In the circumstances , is there not a possibility that unintended positive consequences may emerge as well ?
The cleric from Qom is , of course , concerned exclusively with the frustrated libidos of male teenagers .
The rules of sigheh were invented by misogynists and allow Muslim men to enjoy sexual relationships with non - Muslim women while Muslim women may only "" get married "" to co - religionists .
But despite this absurd bias , sigheh has the potential to provoke responses the authorities may find it impossible to control .
Shorn of its religious justifications and arcane rules the practice is not dissimilar from what we westerners call serial monogamy .
As such it could , if authorised , give young Iranians a hitherto hard - to - obtain opportunity to get to know several members of the opposite sex before contracting the permanent version of marriage .
Even if Iranian blokes are as selfish , clumsy and insensitive as British ones , at least some of them may avoid making some blameless woman miserable in perpetuity .
Others will learn to respect their temporary wives more than they ever imagined when the temptations of a legal bonk first attracted them .
Harm only rarely comes from encouraging intimacy between the sexes .
Violence and intolerance stem more often from repression .
Human sexuality is not just wild , wanton and fun .
It can be civilising as well .
Mr Pourmohammadi believes his idea has the capacity to adapt the Islamic Republic 's laws to the needs of young Iranians .
He may find that it would promote mutual respect , affection and solidarity .
He might hate that .
So , I imagine , would the religious schools to which he has delegated responsibility for assessing the wisdom of his proposal .
Never mind .
In the end Iranian youth will make their country change with or without their government 's invitation ."
2007-06-07,"Want to start a blog in Iran ?
Then you 'll have to register it with the government - which has recently begun to require that all bloggers register at samandehi.ir , a site established by the ministry of culture of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's government .
All you need do is give your personal information , including your blog 's username and password - otherwise it will be filtered and blocked so that nobody in Iran , and perhaps outside too , will be able to access it .
This has led to an outcry among many Iranian bloggers who consider the net an independent and free forum for expression .
You might think that 's only going to inconvenience a few people - but you 'd be wrong : Iran has nearly a million bloggers , around 10 % of whom are active , according to Mehdi Boutorabi , manager of the Persianblog free blog hosting service .
His company , the first such service founded in Iran , now hosts more than 780,000 Persian blogs ; and the blog search engine Technorati now lists Farsi , Iran 's native language , among the top 10 languages used online .
And not everyone is going along .
Parastoo Dokouhaki , a renowned blogger who writes on womens ' rights , has put a banner on her blog at parastood.ir which reads : "" I will not register my site ! ""
( It 's been made available for others to copy ) .
Government clampdowns
Consequently , her blog is filtered in Iran .
Many bloggers who have fallen foul of the government clampdowns have subsequently put the same banner in their web pages .
But censorship is n't just for blogs .
Most of Iran 's reformist newspapers have been shut down , rooftop satellite dishes are banned , books are censored and relationships between boys and girls are limited .
Yet blogs also play a major - even growing - role in modern Iranian society .
This is why almost all the leading candidates for Iran 's last presidential election ran their own blogs .
Acknowledging the influence of blogging in Iran , President Ahmadinejad launched his own blog last year even while his government cracked down on bloggers .
The president 's blog is available in Farsi , English , French and Arabic ; he is aiming at an international audience .
What has the president got to say ?
"" I am sorry to say that the American people are kept in an absolute censorship concerning the outside world by their government , "" he wrote in March .
"" I am certain if the American people know where and on what , their tax money is spent , even the strong supporters of the government would not stand it and rush to the street to show their opposition in regard to that issue , "" he went on , responding to a letter apparently from an American mother claiming her son was forcibly taken and sent to Iraq .
In response , comments seem to be unfailingly positive and respectful : "" Do you think we could all live together peacefully in this world if the Americans stopped aggressive interference in other countries ? "" asks one apparently English commenter .
Blogging 's influence in Iran is undeniable .
Recently , when Seyed Reza Shokrollahi found that his friend Yaghoub Yadali , an Iranian writer , had been held illegally in jail for 40 days , he blogged it ( at khabgard.com ) ; he got 5,000 hits .
The next day the link had been spread through the Iranian blogosphere and into newspapers ' headlines .
Finally , the government was forced to release him .
Space for dissent
Blogging in Iran is not confined to particular groups .
Even clergymen and hardliners who once viewed it as an "" opposition "" activity today have blogs of their own - along with gays and lesbians , who have their own communities online . ""
In Iran there is no place to talk about your homosexuality except in your blog .
Now I have hundreds of Iranian gay friends who are bloggers .
When I read about their feelings in their blogs
I 'm healed that I 'm not alone in the country , "" says one Iranian gay blogger writing at hamzaaad.blogspot.com .
And blogs also give a space for dissent - as happened when the British sailors were taken captive earlier this year . ""
Fifteen British sailors were captured , so what ?
Then sanctions are increased , Iran Industrial Ministry prohibited , domestic banks ' relations with foreigners ceased , we were condemned in UN and the next vessel came to the Persian Gulf again in result of that , "" wrote Omid Valinasab , an Iranian blogger at iwishpolitic.blogfa.com , denouncing the government for the detainment .
But the biggest problem most Iranian bloggers face is filtering .
Using a search engine in Iran usually means being confronted again and again with a screen saying : "" Dear customer , access to this site is forbidden . ""
And this happens not when searching for sex , but using a phrase like "" les livres "" ( books ) .
The first time , it can be surprising .
But persist , and you 'll hit the wall of internet filtering again and again for words such as "" stocking "" , "" honey "" and "" teen "" .
Are French books forbidden ?
Well , some are , but in this case it seems you have to blame the close orthography of the French article to the word "" lesbian "" .
Breeding innovation
But it 's not just searches that can disappear behind the wall .
The prizewinning novelist Reza Ghassemi , now based in France , woke up one morning and found his site ( rezaghassemi.org ) of the past six years simply banned .
From getting more than 6,000 hits per day , the post - filter number was around 300 .
He did n't know who to complain to , or why ; only later did others remind him - and in the end persuade him - that the reason was the presence of a file package , titled Eroticism in literature , displayed on his website .
The censor had noticed it and cut his site off .
But the move has also demonstrated one of the internet 's strengths , and even borne out the way in which necessity breeds innovation .
Ghassemi , like many of his colleagues , found that the clampdowns in Iran on the publication of physical books made it wiser to publish his latest novel in the form of an ebook .
Bloggers have welcomed it , reviewing it as though it had been published in paper form .
For clever users , filtering sounds pointless : thousands of proxy sites distribute the net 's wider content to blogs or emails .
But self - censorship is already affecting journalists , writers and intellectuals who fear prosecution .
Whether the bloggers can fare any better remains to be seen ; but what 's clear is that they are all there , trying , working away at the edges that let the rest of the world creep through to tell Iran what the rest of the world is thinking , saying and doing . ·

2007-06-11,"He has provoked the west 's fury with his calls for Israel 's elimination , dismissal of the Holocaust as a "" myth "" and strident advocacy of Iran 's nuclear rights .
Now Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the Iranian president , has ordered his fiery polemics to be saved for posterity in preparation for commercial publication .
He has appointed a 15-member advisory council of his closest aides to study his "" works and opinions "" and choose the most important .
Selected items are likely to be issued as books , CDs and pamphlets .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's readiness to air his radical views has earned him a reputation as a rousing speaker .
Besides infamously calling for Israel to be "" wiped off the map "" , he also struck a chord among Iran 's poor by pledging to redistribute oil wealth "" to people 's tables "" .
The president has already shown a desire to communicate his thoughts to a wider audience by launching his own blog in English , French , Farsi and Arabic .
However , the idea of compiling them as a commercial package has drawn a cynical response from critics .
Some have pointed out that none of Mr Ahmadinejad 's predecessors published their thoughts and speeches while in office .
The move appears to have been prompted by the precedent of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , father of Iran 's 1979 Islamic revolution , whose numerous writings and speeches are published by an institution founded by his son .
However , Rooz Online , an opposition website , suggested Mr Ahmadinejad 's advisers would have a much thinner body of work to choose from .
The only known publication credited to the president - who has a PhD in traffic management - was a treatise about cold asphalt , it said .
The project got off to a false start yesterday when it emerged that two of the advisers selected had declined to participate because they had not been consulted in advance .
Maryam Behrouz - head of the Zeinab Society , a fundamentalist women 's group - said the remaining members could best serve Mr Ahmadinejad by advising him against publication .
"" Fundamentalists have long urged Mr Ahmadinejad to choose experts and strong advisers so that his actions and comments are better conceived on a more rational and thoughtful basis .
We hope this council gives him advice , rather than publishing , "" she told Aftab website .
Ali Akbar Javanfekr , the president 's press secretary , said the council 's establishment was "" necessary "" .
"" It has been established with Mr Ahmadinejad 's approval and he has a positive view towards it , "" he said ."
2007-06-11,"One of Iran 's most outspoken MPs has received a death threat after suggesting that the country 's supreme leader is a weaker figure than the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , spiritual head of the 1979 Islamic revolution .
The threat appeared amid abusive text messages sent to Emad Afrough , a fundamentalist critic of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , after he described Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as "" more expediency - seeking than the late imam "" . ""
The imam [ Khomeini ] was more truth - seeking and less inclined towards tarouf [ traditional courtesy ] and expediency .
Perhaps the restrictions and pressures prevent him from expressing true stances .
[ But ] we are living in a system where truth is supposed to rule , not factional , personal or group expediencies . ""
Mr Afrough 's comments , to the Farsi news agency , are highly sensitive in Iran , where insulting the leader carries a potential jail sentence .
Yesterday he was ousted as chairman of parliament 's cultural committee .
He insists his remarks were taken out of context and accuses "" power - seekers "" of orchestrating a smear campaign .
"" If even [ assassination ] happens , I would regard it as martyrdom and accept it with great pride , "" he told Aftab website .
The Kayhan newspaper , believed to have close ties to the leadership , defended Mr Afrough and said his comments were not an attack on Mr Khamenei .
Meanwhile , Iran said yesterday it was holding a fourth US - Iranian citizen on suspicion of spying .
Ali Shakeri , an academic at the University of California 's Centre for Citizen Peacebuilding , has failed to return from a trip to Iran .
Three American - Iranians have already been detained for alleged spying and security offences ."
2007-06-24,"Spending time in Iran inevitably results in endless conversations about politics .
Virtually everybody has an opinion about the US , Israel , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the nuclear issue , women 's rights or even underground hip - hop ( one of the country 's most famous rappers was recently arrested in Tehran for subversive activity . )
I 've never visited a country where the bounds of behaviour are so profoundly divided between the public and private spaces .
The country 's former vice president in parliamentary legal affairs under previous President Khatami , Mohammed Ali Abtahi
- he is also a popular reformist blogger - told me last week that the country 's current tensions with the west were highly regrettable , but could be resolved with better diplomacy .
He imagined an Iran with strict Islamic values , filtering of "" pornographic and inflammatory "" websites , no engagement with Israel but societal liberalisation .
Like many in Iran , Abtahi is a contradictory figure - not willing to tell the west what they wanted to hear about the Islamic republic - but he remains a believer in strong engagement with the US .
Perhaps one of the most surprising aspects of Iran was the private discussion over the Iraq war .
State - run media was comprehensively against the US - led occupation , but many people told me , including Abtahi , that a sudden withdrawal of American troops from the war - ravaged nation was inadvisable .
There was a general belief that the country 's chaos would only worsen if US forces left too suddenly .
I had simply expected common consensus against the American presence .
Despite this position , nobody had any comprehensive ideas how to end the current crisis .
The Iran regularly portrayed in the western media - a Jew - hating president determined to strike Israel - is shunned by many Iranians .
Access to the internet is pervasive - around one million blogs exist in Iran and while many are for meeting boys and girls , rather than political in nature , the web has changed the dialogue - and young Iranians are very well aware of the damage being done to their country by Ahmadinjad 's ravings ( though none supported a US strike against the country ) .
Iranians appear willing to shun US foreign policy while warmly embracing the American and British peoples , despite both countries meddling in the republic .
Internet censorship is a growing problem , however .
Type in words like "" choral "" or "" queer "" into Google and both will be blocked ( the former because "" oral "" is a banned phrase . )
Google Earth is not generally accessible .
There is little international e - business because Iranians ca n't easily obtain a Visa or Mastercard , making such transactions virtually impossible ( likewise trying to purchase products on sites like Amazon . )
The mullahs have realised the potential of the internet - magazine editor and blogger Bozorgmehr Sharafedin said that the reformist movement was failing to gain international support because it translated none of its newspapers into English - and now train bloggers in the holy city of Qom .
Using the internet at Iranian "" coffeenets "" is an interesting experience .
Numerous , seemingly harmless sites are blocked -
Australian news - sites are filtered , the New York Times is not - and censorship appears to be based on certain key words appearing regularly on websites .
Like in China , where western multinationals are covertly assisting the government in building a massive filtering system , the Iranians , under Ahmadinejad and the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei , are following a similar path .
Engagement with the outside world is matched by a paranoid mentality that views many Western sources as suspect .
The surreal nature of the regime was highlighted when I spent the day at the offices of the magazine edited by Sharafedin .
He received a call from a bureaucrat inside the ministry of culture and was asked why his publication had been released without covers for the past two months .
Sharafedin explained that glossy covers had been attached to all editions , and clearly the copies that the ministry had received had been inadvertently published without them ( every publication must be submitted weekly to the ministry for their comments and criticisms . )
After a short , terse conversation , Sharafedin organised copies of his magazine to be sent to the ministry immediately .
While Iran is an authoritarian country , there is far greater political debate there than many other Middle Eastern nations ( such as , say , Syria ) .
Iranians may be the most hospitable people in the world , and yet any American or Israeli attack against the country 's nuclear facilities would be met with even - greater repression at home and rallying around the conservative leadership .
For many westerners , the concept of Islam at the heart of a prosperous nation is too much to bear .
It 's a sad indictment of many post 9/11 mindsets ."
2007-06-25,"The Iranian president today extended a surprise olive branch to his domestic critics by agreeing to meet experts who warned his economic policies risked plunging the country into financial chaos .
In a marked departure from his usual abrasive approach , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said he wants "" dialogue "" with 57 economists who criticised him in an open letter , for policies that they claimed fuelled inflation , hurt the poor and laid the seeds of future crises .
The letter earlier this month - whose signatories included former economic advisers to previous governments and an ex - head of the Tehran stock exchange - also accused the government of lavishing Iran 's oil revenues into ill - conceived projects while masking its economic failures behind falsified statistics .
"" The price of decisions that have no scientific basis is very high and irreversible , in particular for those who are worst off , "" the letter said .
Mr Ahmadinejad has dismissed those voicing similar criticisms as politically motivated and acting in the interests of corruption or foreign powers .
But in a distinct turnaround , the president 's spokesman , Morteza Ghamaravafa , said he took an open - minded view towards the letter , which followed months of public and media complaints over rising living costs . ""
The president , after being informed of this letter , expressed his readiness to provide an opportunity for direct , frank and friendly talks with its signatories , in order to gain a close - up awareness of his critics ' views , "" he said .
The offer comes as the UN security council 's permanent five members plus Germany discuss possible fresh sanctions against Iran for defying the latest deadline for suspending uranium enrichment .
Experts have expressed doubts over the economy 's capacity to cope with deepening sanctions .
The stock market reacted with panic last month after Mr Ahmadinejad ordered banks to slash interest rates to 12 % , well below inflation , unofficially estimated at 20 - 30 % .
Economists accuse the government of depleting Iran 's foreign currency reserves to fund its extravagant spending policies .
Despite oil revenues of £ 27bn last year , they also say non - oil exports have plunged since Mr Ahmadinejad took office two years ago , leading to a negative balance of payments .
Iran last week postponed for a month the introduction of petrol rationing , intended to cut the cost of providing hugely subsidised fuel to motorists ."
2007-06-28,"Iranians set fire to a dozen petrol stations in Tehran in the early hours yesterday , angered by the sudden start of fuel rationing , a step that threatens to further increase the unpopularity of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
After the violence security was strengthened at several stations , and there was calm as Iranians lined up to fill their tanks under the new restrictions , which limit private drivers to 100 litres ( 22 gallons ) a month .
The government has been warning for weeks that it would start rationing , but the announcement on Tuesday , only three hours before the measure went into effect at midnight , sent Iranians rushing to fill up .
The rationing is part of a government attempt to reduce billions of dollars in subsidies it pays to keep petrol prices low .
Iran is one of the world 's biggest oil producers , but has few refineries and imports more than 50 % of its petrol needs .
The government says money saved from subsidies can go to building refineries , improving public transportation and job creation .
But a rise in petrol prices last month and now the rationing are feeding discontent with Mr Ahmadinejad , who was elected in 2005 on a platform of helping the poor and fixing Iran 's ailing economy . ""
This man Ahmadinejad has damaged all things .
The timing of the rationing is just one case , "" said Reza Khorrami , a teacher who was among those lining up at a Tehran petrol station .
The short notice appeared to be aimed at preventing a rush to hoard petrol .
Yesterday a group of legislators tried to draft a bill for cancelling the rationing , but failed to win majority support ."
2007-06-28,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , was under pressure to perform a U - turn on petrol rationing yesterday after the restriction prompted violent protests at filling stations across the country this week .
MPs said they would press the government to alter or even scrap the plan after angry citizens set fire to at least a dozen petrol stations in Tehran and chanted slogans against President Ahmadinejad following Tuesday night 's sudden introduction of quotas .
Banks , supermarkets and fire engines were also attacked while further disturbances were reported in other big cities , including Isfahan and Shiraz .
There were unconfirmed reports that three people were killed in the violence , which led to 80 arrests .
In a sign of official concern that the disturbances might spread , the government temporarily closed the country 's mobile phone text messaging network after widespread circulation of a text urging protestors to gather in Tehran 's Valiasr Square .
The unrest was triggered by an announcement on state television on the rationing , prompting a rush by drivers to fill their tanks .
Motorists are restricted to a monthly limit of 100 litres ( 22 gallons ) for the next four months while cab drivers must not exceed 800 litres .
Iran , the world 's fourth largest oil producer , imposed rationing to try to cut the estimated £ 5bn annual cost of providing massively subsidised petrol , which has to be imported because the country lacks refinery capacity .
While parliament has already approved the plan , MPs had urged the government to delay the scheme amid fears over its social and economic impact .
However , some analysts say it has become more urgent because of the prospect of further UN security council sanctions over Iran 's nuclear programme .
Nevertheless , there was anger yesterday that the government had implemented the scheme without prior notice in an apparent attempt to prevent fuel hoarding .
Esmaeil Ahmadi - Moqaddam , the chief of police , said its implementation had even been kept secret from his officers , so there had been no time to provide extra security for the filling stations .
MPs attacked the failure to allow motorists to buy fuel at higher free market prices and said that if disturbances continued parliament might be recalled from the three - week recess that began yesterday .
Kamal Daneshyar , chairman of the parliamentary energy committee , said : "" We have told the government ... that rationing with this mechanism should not be implemented , but they paid no attention .
Petrol rationing will not last long and will be only a short - term measure .
Free - market prices should be offered sufficiently .
"" The decision has already had an impact on Tehran 's congested roads , with traffic cut as cars are left at home to save fuel .
Taxi drivers have responded by raising fares .
Issa Saharkhiz , a political analyst , suggested the impact on the fortunes of Mr Ahmadinejad 's could be equally dramatic . ""
This will damage [ him ] and the people and groups around him , maybe even the supreme leader .

2007-07-01,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad campaigned for the Iranian presidency on a slogan of "" putting oil wealth on the people 's tables "" .
Not only has a large fuel can dropped off those tables , with rationing introduced last week ; so has a once plentiful basket of fruit and veg .
Iran 's central bank says inflation is running at 14 % , but the real figure could be double that .
Unemployment could also be running as high as 30 % .
No surprise , then , that a group of 60 economists has written to the president , blaming his mismanagement for the country 's economic woes .
All this , plus the torching of petrol stations , has damaged Mr Ahmadinejad 's reputation as a champion of the poor , dented the authority of the hardline factions in the revolutionary guard and harmed the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
At this rate , Mr Ahmadinejad may struggle to rebuild his political authority , let alone get re - elected .
Supporters of stronger sanctions on Iran may be tempted to think that international pressure is having this effect .
Economic sanctions have already been imposed on Iran for refusing to halt its programme of uranium enrichment .
Now a bill proposed by a bipartisan panel in the US House of Representatives would reduce the country 's access to imported petrol .
One of the biggest oil producers , Iran 's lack of refining capacity means it still has to import more than half of its petrol .
So Mr Ahmadinejad may have imposed petrol rationing as a pre - emptive measure to guard against tightening of the economic noose .
Those negotiations with Iran on its nuclear programme are nearing a critical stage .
The latest offer represents a compromise by the group of nations ( including Britain and the US ) that are engaged in negotiations with Iran : a freeze on new UN sanctions in return for a freeze on all further development of Tehran 's enrichment programme .
This would allow Iran to keep spinning its 3,000 centrifuges , which refine uranium hexafluoride gas , while talks take place on stopping the whole programme .
There is slight cause for hope : Iran said it would answer the International Atomic Energy Agency 's outstanding questions about the last two decades of its nuclear programme .
If the current diplomatic initiative breaks down , and a third and tighter set of economic sanctions are introduced , pressure will grow to bomb Iran .
Washington is already a reluctant partner in the negotiations , and even the Israeli left regards the Iranian nuclear programme as an existential threat .
As the consequences of an air strike on Iran 's nuclear bunkers are too awful to contemplate , all effort has to be channelled into keeping diplomacy on track .
This is going to require time and a steady nerve ."
2007-07-02,"His thirst for the limelight has driven him to launch a multilingual blog and issue a string of headline - grabbing statements .
But Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , was surprisingly camera - shy when his extrovert persona drew the attention of Hollywood , turning down a request by Oliver Stone , the director of JFK , Nixon and Platoon , to make a documentary film about him .
He dismissed the American film - maker as "" part of the Great Satan "" , the Iranian regime 's standard term of abuse for the US .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's aides said Stone had requested special access to the president after contacting his office through intermediaries in the Iranian film business .
The 60-year - old director has made two documentaries about Cuba 's Communist president , Fidel Castro , whom he considers a friend , and another about the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
However , Mr Ahmadinejad , who has often criticised Hollywood as a bastion of pro - Zionist interests , was unimpressed by Stone 's radical credentials after viewing the films . ""
While it is true that Oliver Stone is considered to be among the opposition in the US , the opposition is still part of the Great Satan , "" the president 's media adviser , Mahdi Kalhor , told the semi - official Fars news agency .
"" We believe that the American cinema system is devoid of all culture and art and is only used as a device .
In the last two years , the global arrogance [ Iranian shorthand for the US and Britain ] has made a lot of effort to portray their own image of Ahmadinejad , not the one which exists in reality .
Hollywood and other Zionist media react to phenomena they do n't like through different processes . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad 's adviser , Javan Shamghadri , said Stone 's request might be reconsidered if he could secure the rights for Iranian film - makers to make a documentary about the US president , George Bush , and the CIA without harassment .
Iran has complained repeatedly about how the country is depicted by Hollywood .
Stone 's 2004 film , Alexander , a biopic about Alexander the Great , was heavily criticised because of its sympathetic portrayal of the ancient Macedonian king , who is disliked in Iran because he is held responsible for the destruction of Persepolis , seat of the Achaemenid dynasty , in 330BC .
This year , Iran protested to the UN about another film , 300 , which portrayed the battle of Thermopylae between the Spartans and Persians in 480BC ."
2007-07-04,"Venezuela is to sell petrol to Iran to alleviate its ally 's crippling fuel shortage and to bolster their common front against the US , it was announced yesterday .
President Hugo Chávez made the promise during a visit to Tehran where he pledged an "" axis of unity "" with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , according to Venezuela 's oil minister , Rafael Ramirez , who was part of the visiting delegation . ""
Yes , Iranians have asked to buy gasoline from us and we have accepted this demand , "" he told the Iranian daily newspaper Shargh , without elaborating .
The announcement came a week after Iran imposed fuel rationing which brought riots in several cities and increased anger at the government 's failure to ease economic hardship .
Iran is a major oil producer but a shortage of refineries forces it to import more than half of its domestic needs .
Rationing was an attempt to reduce consumption and the government subsidies which keep petrol prices artificially low .
Yesterday 's announcement signalled an extension of Mr Chávez 's use of Venezuela 's considerable oil reserves to forge alliances against the US . ""
The two countries will , united , defeat the imperialism of North America , "" he told reporters .
With a smile he added : "" When I come to Iran , Washington gets upset .
"" It was not immediately clear how much petrol would be shipped from the Caribbean to the Persian Gulf , nor whether Tehran would receive a discount on the grounds it was a revolutionary "" brother "" in standing up to the west .
The two presidents signed a number of other economic agreements , including for a dairy factory in Venezuela , a methanol factory in Iran and efforts to boost each other 's exports to Latin America and the Indian subcontinent .
For Tehran it is a way to reduce its international isolation - the result of US - led pressure against its nuclear programme - and for Caracas it is a way to project Mr Chávez as a global player .
He has increased oil exports to China , sent discounted oil to places as diverse as Alaska and London and taken over majority shares in drilling projects , prompting walkouts by Exxon and other multinationals .
However , Venezuela remains more dependent than ever on exports to the US and some analysts say Mr Chávez is nearing the bottom of his treasure chest ."
2007-07-06,"Wanted : photogenic tyrant Oliver Stone approached Mahmoud Ahmadinejad through his contact in the Iranian film industry , apparently , with the idea of making a documentary about him .
If the Iranian president had n't said no , it would have been the third in a long line of Stone 's political documentaries - almost enough , I think , to warrant its own genre name : dictator - docs , or , for brevity , dic - docs .
He 's already done Castro , see .
Twice .
Ahmadinejad , having no sense of flair , refused on the basis that Stone is "" part of the Great Satan "" ( capitalisation is a minefield with dictators .
Does n't Great Satan make him sound like Great Bear or Great Lakes ?
Like , something that actually exists , rather than a made - up bogeyman in red lycra with horns ? ) .
There are so many ways you could object to Stone .
It seems a shame to waste his objectionableness by just rolling it into a general objection to America , but there we go .
But still , any rebuff would have been a disappointment to Stone , who is peculiarly intoxicated by the notion of the power - crazed tyrant , even by the standards of an industry so drunk already on dictatorly charisma that it could probably survive until the end of its days on just the narrative of ancient Rome , with a smattering of Argentina .
What are they looking for , in these men ?
What is the dramatic quintessence of the dic - doc ?
Well , for starters , drama is conflict .
This is the lesson of Greek tragedy , and also of EastEnders , which if conflict were n't at the root of drama , would otherwise just be a load of working - class people shouting at each other .
There is always a lot of conflict around dictators because they are loopy , and also because they lack the corrective of being told off .
That is the second element of drama : having a lot of people around who are n't saying what they mean .
It is called "" dramatic irony "" , and you see it a lot in Molière , and also One Foot in the Grave , which is otherwise just a woman who ca n't be bothered talking to her husband because she 's bored of him .
Nobody ever says what they mean around dictators in case they get their bits chopped off .
And that 's the third element of drama : people getting their bits chopped off .
You see it a lot in Shakespeare , and also in the oeuvre of Mel Gibson .
I truly do not understand the appeal of it .
I do n't !
I was looking away for so much of Apocalypto that I missed all the subtitles and still do n't know what happened .
Naturally , dictators throw in a lot of gore , which is how they get to be at the axis of evil in the first place .
Some would say : "" Let 's bomb the bejesus out of them , "" but some equally useful lessons can be learned from observing them , day - in - the - life style .
Castro , I should add , does not chop people 's bits off .
Having delineated it , I see now that the case for the dic - doc is so strong , I 'm amazed that anybody makes documentaries about anything else .
Who cares about cockle - pickers and suspected paedophiles and polar bears ?
You 're making a documentary , people !
You ca n't make up the plot , the least you can do is pick someone who makes an interesting plot for themselves , with their world - changingly maniacal behaviour !
If he can handle advice , in his disappointed state , I would remind Stone that there is a cool dictator in Turkmenistan , who festoons the nation with brightly coloured pictures of himself , so it would all be really visual , as well as dramatic .
I know he 's not the dic - doc A - list , but you 've got to take these people where you find them ."
2007-07-09,"Allies of Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , have accused the media of trying to depose him in a "" creeping coup "" , raising fears of a fresh clampdown on opposition newspapers and websites .
The accusation , from the president 's allies , coincides with disclosures that Mr Ahmadinejad has authorised aides to establish a special team to counter "" black propaganda against the government "" .
There has been criticism from the reformist and liberal press that Mr Ahmadinejad has failed to deliver his electoral promises of prosperity and has instead presided over an ailing economy and soaring inflation .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's advisers complain he has been insulted by "" rumour - mongers "" who represent "" economic and political gangs "" opposed to his social justice agenda .
In interviews , several supporters signalled that the government was preparing to retaliate .
Mohammad Jafar Behdad , Mr Ahmadinejad 's communications adviser , said the government would "" come out of its shell "" to strike at its enemies .
"" We know our adversary and we are going to keep on defending the government against the dirty lies , "" he told Fars News Agency .
"" There are some signs of a creeping coup in the press , "" the combative culture and Islamic guidance minister , Mohammad Hossein Saffar - Harandi , told the official IRNA news agency .
"" When we say a creeping coup , it means a person is moving within a framework of an action to overthrow [ the system ] .
"" The allegation echoes charges brought against four Iranian - Americans who are accused of spying after being identified as part of a US - led plot aimed at toppling Iran 's Islamic government .
It follows the suspensions last week of a reformist newspaper , Ham - Mihan - ostensibly on a legal technicality - and of ILNA , an online news agency critical of Mr Ahmadinejad .
Activists have been arrested in a crackdown , which Iran has justified on national security grounds amid pressure from the UN over its nuclear weapons .
However , Mohammad Atrianfar , a liberal commentator and policy director of Ham - Mihan , said : "" The government is angry because the media sees the difference between its slogans and its performance .
But the number of critical newspapers is very low and can not conduct anything against the government that could be described as a coup . ""
American - Iranians facing spying charges : · Haleh Esfandiari , of the Washington - based Woodrow Wilson Centre · Kian Tajbakhsh , connected with the Soros Open Society Institute in New York .

2007-07-23,"Fuelling discontent : Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad speaking at a ceremony at the Natanz uranium enrichment facility .

Given the bloody mayhem in Iraq , and the clamour in Washington to bring the boys home from a failing war , it may seem hard to believe that any sane western policymaker could be contemplating yet another attack on another , much bigger , Muslim country .
But as Iran moves inexorably closer to learning how to build an atomic bomb , the danger that America or Israel will attack its nuclear sites is now acute .
As the Economist argues in a special report this week , Iran is now within fingertip - touch of mastering the dark arts of nuclear enrichment .
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency , the UN 's nuclear watchdog , it could by the end of this month have as many as 3,000 centrifuges spinning at the underground plant it built secretly at Natanz , south of Tehran .
Most experts say that if these ran at full speed and high efficiency for a year , they could make enough nuclear fuel for a crude atomic bomb .
Making a workable weapon would take more time .
But even the cautious IAEA now reckons that if it wanted to Iran could become a nuclear - weapons state within three years .
Iran 's denial that it has this aim is belied by the obstinacy with which it has defied two unanimous resolutions from the UN security council , ordering it to suspend enrichment and applying economic sanctions .
The fact that Russia and China removed their previous protection of Iran and supported these resolutions shows how worried even Iran 's friends and trading partners are .
But the sanctions are not working .
Despite rising inflation and unemployment , the introduction of petrol rationing , and the European Union 's offer of extensive economic help if Iran stops enrichment and comes clean about its nuclear ambitions , the centrifuges spin on .
An American or Israeli military attack on Iran would not be mad .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's fire - breathing president , has reminded the world that hostility to the Jewish state is hardwired into Iran 's revolutionary DNA .
Ayatollah Khomeini called it the duty of every Muslim to reverse the sin of Israel 's creation .
And , unlike the case of Iraq , there would be no question this time of false intelligence : the world is worried about the existence of facilities Iran boasts about openly .
Nor would there be any question of following up air strikes with an invasion : with a population of more than 70 m , Iran is just too big for that .
A case can therefore be made that a military attack would be better than allowing a self - proclaimed theocracy to acquire nuclear weapons .
This is not a private fantasy harboured only by George Bush and Dick Cheney : all America 's front - running presidential candidates , Democrats as well as Republicans , say that they would also contemplate a pre - emptive strike if sanctions fail .
Such an attack would , nonetheless , be a huge and dangerous gamble .
The Economist 's special report argues strongly against it , not least because the prickly and beleaguered revolutionaries currently presiding over a hardline crackdown on dissent in Iran would feel compelled for their own political survival to strike back .
And Iran has the means .
It could fire hundreds of missiles at Israel , harry American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan , and choke off the world 's tanker traffic through the vital Strait of Hormuz .
It is difficult to imagine any happy ending to this crisis without two immediate changes of policy .
The first is that Russia and China need to join the west in a new and much sharper sanctions resolution , directed not at Iran 's people but at the financial interests of the regime 's clerical leaders and the economic empire of their protectors , the Revolutionary Guards Corps .
The second is that America needs to overcome a phobia that goes back to the embassy hostage crisis of 1979 and promise Iran not just non - belligerency , but normal relations , once it reassures the world about its nuclear ambitions .
A deal of this kind would require a painful adjustment of ideology in Washington and Tehran alike .
But the alternative , for both countries and for the Middle East , is otherwise bleak .

2007-07-24,"A billboard of Hugo Chávez and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad looms over a motorway in Venezuela , marking the entrance to a factory designed to produce three things : tractors , influence and angst .
The tractors , lined up in shiny red phalanxes on the grounds of Veniran , a joint venture between Venezuela and Iran , are for peasants and socialist cooperatives across Latin America .
The influence , less visible but real enough , is for Mr Chávez and Mr Ahmadinejad , two presidents who hope this and other ventures will project their prestige and power .
The angst , if all goes to plan , is for Washington .
Veniran might be tucked away in the backwater provincial capital of Ciudad Bolívar
but it is part of a wider attempt by Mr Chávez to forge a common front against the United States .
The socialist radical is using Venezuela 's vast oil wealth to strike commercial and political deals with countries that challenge the US such as Iran , Belarus , Russia and China , as well as much of Latin America and the Caribbean , to rebuff what he refers to as the "" empire "" .
"" Chávez is a global player because right now he has a lot of money that he is prepared to spend to advance his huge ambitions , "" said Michael Shifter , an analyst with the Inter - American Dialogue thinktank .
"" He has worked tirelessly to upset US priorities in Latin America . ""
Cocaine Supporters say he has worked tirelessly to support the poor and marginalised , for example through a $ 250,000 ( £ 121,000 ) loan to help farmers in Bolivia 's lowlands build a coca industrialization plant , part of an effort to turn the leaf into cakes , biscuits and other legal products instead of cocaine . ""
For years we have wanted to do this but no one would support us , "" said Leonardo Choque , leader of the Chimoré federation of coca growers .
"" Then the Venezuelans come and offer us a loan with very low interest rates .
And no conditions .
"" Venezuela is also funding a new university nearby .
In contrast the US is accused of bullying Andean nations into destroying coca crops without promoting equally lucrative alternative livelihoods - a big stick and a small carrot .
Of all Mr Chávez 's alliances the one with Iran is the most striking .
Some of the estimated 180 economic and political accords signed with the mullahs over recent years are now bearing fruit - and prompting some disquiet among the small Jewish community .
The first "" anti - imperialist cars "" from a joint venture reached Venezuela 's roads this month , with the first batch earmarked for army officers .
There is now a weekly flight between Caracas and Tehran , with a stopover in Damascus , operated by the Venezuelan state - controlled airline Conviasa and Iran 's national carrier , Iran Air .
New mosques are popping up across Venezuela and universities are teaching Farsi .
Iran is to help build platforms in a $ 4bn development of Orinoco delta oil deposits in exchange for reciprocal Venezuelan investments .
The 4,000 tractors produced annually in Ciudad Bolívar are small beer in comparison but they have a symbolic value as agents of revolutionary change .
Most are given or leased at discount in Venezuela to socialist cooperatives that have seized land , with government blessing , from big ranches and sugar plantations .
Dozens have also been sent to Bolivia to support President Evo Morales , a leftwing radical and close Chávez ally , and last week dozens more began to be shipped north to Nicaragua , whose president , Daniel Ortega , is another Chávez ally and longtime bugbear for Washington .
The first batch was timed to coincide with the 28th anniversary of the Sandinista revolution .
"" The idea is to help our brothers develop the land , "" said Reza Mahboubi , an Iranian manager at the plant .
The technology was Iranian , as were the supervisors , but most of the 130 staff were Venezuelan .
Asked if the objective was also to stick a finger in George Bush 's eye , Mr Mahboubi merely smiled .
Sun and salsa A colleague who asked not to be named said the Iranians had been warmly welcomed .
"" I love it here .
It 's hot and sunny and they eat rice , just like back home .
Except here I go out salsa dancing . ""
Mr Chávez inaugurated the factory in 2005 with the then Iranian president , Mohammad Khatami .
He has struck up a friendship with his successor , Mr Ahmadinejad , and hailed their "" axis of unity "" . ""
The relationship is fundamentally geopolitical rather than economic , "" said Mr Shifter .
"" It tells the world that Iran , an international pariah , is welcome in Latin America , which is traditionally regarded as the strategic preserve or ' back yard ' of the United States . ""
The alliance has cost Mr Chávez some support .
Europe would be friendlier were it not for his embrace of a Holocaust - denying Islamist , said the Council on Hemispheric Affairs thinktank .
That may also partly explain his low popularity rating in a recent survey of global attitudes by the Pew Foundation .
However the Venezuelan leader has calculated there is more to gain than lose . ""
When I come to Iran , Washington gets upset , "" he said on a visit earlier this month , his sixth .
He has likened Iran 's Islamic revolution to his own secular revolution , a mix of socialism and ideas drawn from Simón Bolívar , South America 's 19th century liberator .
Backstory They make for an odd couple .
Hugo Chávez , big and bear - like , is a radical socialist who quotes Marx , leads a largely Catholic country and has a habit of breaking into song .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , bird - like in comparison , is a radical Islamist who quotes the prophet Muhammad and is not readily associated with fun or secularism .
Yet the two presidents have forged a personal and strategic relationship , and hold hands while touring joint ventures .
They are linked by oil - Venezuela and Iran are big producers - and aversion to the US , which both regard as a hostile , predatory empire .
Building economic and political ties , they calculate , will buttress Caracas and Tehran against Washington , the Great Satan ."
2007-08-02,"The man from the Iranian embassy spoke in awed tones as if we had won Willy Wonka 's golden ticket .
A select group of European and American journalists would be allowed to see Iran 's nuclear programme in its entirety , from the uranium enrichment plant in Natanz to the heavy water reactor in Arak .
Plus , there would be an interview with the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , on his nation 's aspirations and its response to UN sanctions .
"" This has never happened before , "" the diplomat said .
By the time we set out on July 19 , however , it was clear there was some disagreement back in Tehran over exactly what would be made public and the trip was twice postponed and then brought forward once .
Doubts began to creep in that it was going to happen at all .
Sure enough , when the group ( comprising the Guardian , the Independent , National Public Radio from the US , le Monde and le Nouvel Observateur from France ) assembled at Tehran 's Mehrabad airport two days later , this particular episode in Iranian glasnost was beginning to fade .
Natanz dropped off the itinerary first .
The uranium enrichment site there , where Iran has installed over 2,000 centrifuges , is the focus of international scrutiny .
The number of centrifuges spinning uranium hexafluoride gas will determine how quickly the country can manufacture nuclear fuel , and if it so chose , a nuclear warhead .
We were told there were "" technical problems "" at the site .
Were also informed our presence would interrupt important work at Natanz .
Either way , it was off the menu .
Arak , another controversial site because heavy water reactors are one way of producing plutonium , also faded fast from a certainty to an inshallah ( God willing ) possibility .
And it was made clear that divine intervention would also be necessary to secure some time with the president .
In the end , inevitably , neither materialised .
We protested things that this was not what had been advertised when we were told to drop everything and rush to Tehran .
But the two men from the foreign ministry shrugged and said they were trying their best .
And almost certainly they were .
The trip was a reminder that the foreign ministry carries little clout in a government that is still run like a revolutionary conspiracy rather than a public administration , and where those with links to foreigners are treated with suspicion .
For the foreign ministry , that is something of an institutional liability .
We were offered other distractions , while being driven around in a VIP air - conditioned bus with luxury revolving seats .
We were shown Isfahan , an undeniably beautiful city .
Perhaps we would like to see its splendid steelworks , we were asked .
Perhaps not , we replied .
In the end , we were shown around Isfahan 's uranium conversion plant , where uranium is transformed from a processed ore , "" yellowcake "" , to uranium hexafluoride .
It is 15 km south - east of the city , wedged up against some sandstone mountains , where commercial satellite photos have shown some new roads and possible tunnelling .
When I asked about the photos , our guides shrugged and smiled . ""
If that 's what they [ the Americans ] say we 're doing , then that 's what we 're doing , "" said an engineer , with heavy irony , weary of the constant international suspicion .
There is no mistaking the pride that surrounds the nuclear project here .
A film shown before our tour began records the production of the first uranium hexafluoride at Isfahan some three years ago .
At its climax , the then deputy head of the atomic energy organisation , Mohammad Ghanadi , can be seen running out of the plant holding the inaugural vial above his head , wiping a tear from his eye .
With a pulsing electronic soundtrack , it was reminiscent of Chariots of Fire .
The government has made something of a fetish of uranium enrichment , persuading the population it is synonymous with development and prosperity .
Four out of five Iranians support the programme , according to a recent poll .
But that public support is double - edged .
It would make it very hard for President Ahmadinejad to climb down from his adamant refusal to suspend enrichment , even if he wanted to .
Iranian officials say nuclear power generation is necessary because the country 's oil will eventually run out , and will not be able to keep an expanding economy going .
But , even if that is the case , you might expect to see more nuclear reactors being built .
At the moment there is only the power plant at Bushehr , which is supposed just to use Russian fuel .
Iran is also making few attempts to economise on fossil fuel .
Urban Iranians have a carbon footprint to challenge even the Americans .
The one - hour trip from Tehran to Isfahan is made on a 747 jumbo jet , at the cost of about £ 10 each way per person .
Petrol costs about 10p a litre , so Tehran is usually one continuous traffic jam .
On Friday there is gridlock at midnight .
And electricity is 70 % subsidised .
Seen from the air at nights , the capital burns as bright as any American metropolis .
Because petrol is sold so cheaply , it makes no economic sense to build refineries in Iran , but because of the absence of refineries there is actually a petrol shortage .
Rather than raise prices , the government has introduced rationing , handing out smart cards that limit most users to 100 litres a month .
There was an initial wave of protests a month ago when the scheme was first introduced but those have since faded .
The lull may be an illusion though .
Many people have burned through much of the four - month ration on their initial smart card in just over 30 days .
When the cards run out and people can no longer get to work , there is likely to be another bout of anger and frustration .
In a way , the artificial scarcity serves to reinforce the government 's arguments that nuclear power is essential .
Iran 's row with Russia over Bushehr ( Moscow says it has n't been paid and has withdrawn some of its workers ) also helps underscore the message that Iran can not rely on foreigners for its nuclear fuel .
We were taken to see Bushehr , which is still under construction and it was clear the Iranians and the Russians were not getting along .
The Russians keep to themselves in their own compounds in the Gulf coast port , and there is hardly any social mixing .
On the side of the reactor wall , someone had scrawled , in Russian : "" Everything passes and we will get past this . ""
Perhaps not , though .
The Iranian government is feeling beleaguered and defiant .
It believes any more sanctions will rally popular support behind it , as would air strikes .
So Tehran does not feel it has much to lose and it is calling the west 's bluff .
The failure so far to answer all the IAEA ( International Atomic Energy Agency ) questions about past nuclear activities - just like the last - minute rethink on what we were allowed to see - could mean Iran has something to hide .
Or it could just mean that the country is being run by a rather dysfunctional and indecisive government that is slightly paranoid about the outside world .
Perhaps the truth involves a bit of both ."
2007-08-04,"America 's power has been so overwhelming for so long that many think it has survived George Bush 's presidency unscathed .
That this is untrue is demonstrated by those , from Russia 's Vladimir Putin and Venezuela 's Hugo Chávez to Iran 's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe , who are exploiting America 's loss of standing and influence .
This is no cause for schadenfreude .
On the contrary , it is high time for friends of the United States , particularly in Europe , to realise that America 's weakness undermines their international influence as well .
The evidence of America 's weakness is clear enough .
At the height of America 's power , Russia had resigned itself to the apparently unstoppable encroachment of Nato on the Soviet Union 's former sphere of influence .
President Putin tolerated a US presence in central Asia to assist in the campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan and raised no serious objections when the US trashed the anti - ballistic missile treaty prohibiting strategic missile defenses .
America , eager to bring both Ukraine and Georgia into Nato , felt scant need to consider Russian concerns , convinced that the Kremlin would have no choice but to bow to the inevitable .
That was yesterday .
Today , Putin seeks to regain the influence Russia lost in previous years .
He is skillfully playing the anti - America card across Europe while putting pressure on the Baltic states , a clear warning not to extend Nato any further .
In Ukraine , political forces resisting closer strategic links to the west have gained ground .
And the Kremlin is aggressively portraying the planned establishment of a modest US missile defence installation in Poland and the Czech Republic as a threat to Russia 's vital security interests .
Or consider Iran , another power exploiting American weakness .
Only a few years ago , Iran 's government seemed sufficiently in awe of the US to inch toward an agreement on its nuclear program that would have interrupted , and perhaps even halted , its enrichment activities .
There was talk of possible bilateral contacts with the US , which , if successful , would have ended almost three decades of hostile relations .
Today , Iran 's enrichment program is going ahead despite the United Nations security council 's warnings of new sanctions , while Iranian officials publicly ridicule threats of US military action .
These examples reflect the same message : America is losing clout around the world .
The Bush administration is internationally exposed in both the arrogance of its concepts and the limits of its power .
It lacks support at home and respect abroad .
Never since the US became the world 's predominant power during the second world war has there been a similar decline in its international influence .
Even during the Vietnam war and following its humiliating withdrawal from southeast Asia , there was never any serious doubt about America 's authority and ability to deal with what was then the central strategic challenge , the cold war .
In today 's interdependent world , however , it is no longer the number of nuclear warheads that bestows influence , but a country 's ability to get others to go along with policies that it regards as serving its major interests .
Bush 's America has forfeited that influence - in the Middle East , in Asia and Africa , and in much of Europe .
Many in the US like to think that this is a temporary state of affairs that will vanish with the election of a new president and Congress in 2008 .
But they are neither sufficiently aware of the damage done nor realistic enough about the chances of Bush 's potential successors - many of whom initially supported his adventurism - to revive the trust and respect their country once enjoyed .
To achieve that will take more than a new face in the White House .
It will require years of hard work to reconcile America 's resources and requirements , and to ensure that its initiatives can once again be seen as designed not to serve narrow US ideologies , but to advance a fair international order .
The result of protracted US weakness is also a weaker Europe .
In the heyday of American dominance , European governments profited doubly : they were part of a powerful west and courted as a potential counterweight to US dominance by third countries .
If they dissented from US positions , this did not seriously impair the west 's strategic efficacy because American power was more than sufficient to compensate .
That arrangement no longer works .
If European governments today distance themselves from America , as their citizens frequently demand , they will both antagonise and further weaken the US .
At the same time , they will undermine their own international influence , allow others to play off Europe against America , destroying as well what chance remains for rebuilding the west with a reformed America .
European leaders , even when they are unhappy over US positions , therefore need to combine forceful support for the transatlantic community of interests with discrete , if firm lobbying in Washington not to strain it to the breaking point .
Whether they can successfully perform this difficult act , remains to be seen .
Fortunately , Angela Merkel , Nicolas Sarkozy , and Gordon Brown understand the challenge , and at least some parts of the Bush government seem aware of the problem .
In the long period of American weakness , European leaders will have to demonstrate statesmanship for the west as a whole .
It is a role for which decades of US supremacy have scarcely prepared them .

2007-08-06,"Authorities in Iran closed down the country 's leading reformist newspaper today in the latest stage of an offensive against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's opponents in the media .
Shargh , which has been critical of Mr Ahmadinejad , was ordered to shut after running an interview with an anti - regime poet last Saturday .
The poet , Saghi Qahraman , who is believed to live in Canada , has been accused by the country 's Islamic rulers of promoting homosexuality .
The newspaper unsuccessfully attempted to placate official anger by publishing a front - page apology today after withdrawing the offending article from its website .
It was the second time Shargh had been shut in less than a year .
It only reopened in May after being closed last autumn , ostensibly because of official disapproval over the make - up of its editorial team .
However , insiders believed the real reason was a cartoon depicting a haloed donkey - assumed to symbolise Mr Ahmadinejad - addressing the UN general assembly .
Shargh 's editor , Ahmad Gholami , suggested that Saturday 's interview was merely an excuse for the latest closure .
"" Publication of an interview is not a plausible justification for banning a newspaper , "" he said .
Some observers suggested that an additional motivation was a satirical article by Masoud Behnoud published yesterday .
Mr Behnoud , a prominent reformist , mockingly recited Mr Ahmadinejad 's most high - profile actions and statements before concluding with heavy irony that he would vote for the president at the next election .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's closest aides have accused opposition journalists of trying to topple him in a "" creeping coup "" and warned that the government will pursue outlets it believes to be guilty of publishing "" lies "" .

Earlier this year Binyamin Netanyahu , Israel 's opposition leader and the man who appears to be styling himself as scaremonger - in - chief , told us : "" It 's 1938 and Iran is Germany .
And Iran is racing to arm itself with atomic bombs . ""
Of Ahmadinejad , he said : "" He is preparing another Holocaust for the Jewish state . ""
A few weeks ago , as Israel 's military intelligence claimed - as it has been doing regularly since the early 1990s - that Iran is only a year or so away from the "" point of no return "" on developing a nuclear warhead , Netanyahu was at it again .
"" Iran could be the first undeterrable nuclear power , "" he warned , adding : "" This is a Jewish problem like Hitler was a Jewish problem ...
The future of the Jewish people depends on the future of Israel . ""
But Netanyahu has been far from alone in making extravagant claims about a looming genocide from Iran .
Israel 's new president , Shimon Peres , has compared an Iranian nuclear bomb to a "" flying concentration camp "" .
And the prime minister , Ehud Olmert , told a German newspaper last year : "" [ Ahmadinejad ] speaks as Hitler did in his time of the extermination of the entire Jewish nation .
"" There is an interesting problem with selling the "" Iran as Nazi Germany "" line .
If Ahmadinejad really is Hitler , ready to commit genocide against Israel 's Jews as soon as he can get his hands on a nuclear weapon , why are some 25,000 Jews living peacefully in Iran and more than reluctant to leave , despite repeated enticements from Israel and American Jews ?
What is the basis for Israel 's dire forecasts - the ideological scaffolding being erected , presumably , to justify an attack on Iran ?
Helpfully , as George Bush defended his Iraq policies last month , he reminded us yet again of the menace Iran supposedly poses : it is "" threatening to wipe Israel off the map "" .
This myth has been endlessly recycled since a translating error was made of a speech Ahmadinejad delivered nearly two years ago .
Farsi experts have verified that the Iranian president , far from threatening to destroy Israel , was quoting from an earlier speech by the late Ayatollah Khomeini in which he reassured supporters of the Palestinians that "" the Zionist regime in Jerusalem "" would "" vanish from the page of time "" .
He was not threatening to exterminate Jews or even Israel .
He was comparing Israel 's occupation of the Palestinians with other illegitimate systems of rule whose time had passed , including the Shahs who once ruled Iran , apartheid South Africa and the Soviet empire .
Nonetheless , this erroneous translation has survived and prospered because Israel and her supporters have exploited it for their own crude propaganda purposes .
In the meantime , the 25,000-strong Iranian Jewish community is the largest in the Middle East outside Israel and traces its roots back 3,000 years .
As one of several non - Muslim minorities in Iran , Jews there suffer discrimination , but they are certainly no worse off than the one million Palestinian citizens of Israel - and far better off than Palestinians under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza .
Iranian Jews have little influence on decision - making and are not allowed to hold senior posts in the army or bureaucracy .
But they enjoy many freedoms .
They have an elected representative in parliament , they practice their religion openly in synagogues , their charities are funded by the Jewish diaspora , and they can travel freely , including to Israel .
In Tehran there are six kosher butchers and about 30 synagogues .
Ahmadinejad 's office recently made a donation to a Jewish hospital in Tehran .
As Ciamak Moresadegh , an Iranian Jewish leader , observed : "" If you think Judaism and Zionism are one , it is like thinking Islam and the Taliban are the same , and they are not .
"" Iran 's leaders denounce Zionism , which they blame for fuelling discrimination against the Palestinians , but they have also repeatedly avowed that they have no problem with Jews , Judaism or even the state of Israel .
Ahmadinejad , caricatured as a merchant of genocide , has in fact called for "" regime change "" - and then only in the sense that he believes a referendum should be held of all inhabitants of Israel and the occupied territories , including refugees from war , on the nature of the government .
Despite the absence of any threat to Iran 's Jews , the Israeli media recently reported that the Israeli government has been trying to find new ways to entice Iranian Jews to Israel .
The Ma'ariv newspaper pointed out that previous schemes had found few takers .
There was , noted the report , "" a lack of desire on the part of thousands of Iranian Jews to leave "" .
According to the New York - based Forward newspaper , a campaign to persuade Iranian Jews to emigrate to Israel caused only 152 out of these 25,000 Jews to leave Iran between October 2005 and September 2006 , and most of them were said to have emigrated for economic reasons , not political ones .
To step up these efforts - and presumably to avoid the embarrassing incongruence of claiming Iran 's genocidal intent while thousands of Jews live happily in Tehran - Israel is now backing a move by Jewish donors to guarantee every Iranian Jewish family $ 60,000 to settle in Israel , in addition to a host of existing financial incentives that are offered to Jewish immigrants , including loans and cheap mortgages .
The announcement was met with scorn by the Society of Iranian Jews , which issued a statement that their national identity was not for sale .
"" The identity of Iranian Jews is not tradeable for any amount of money .
Iranian Jews are among the most ancient Iranians .
Iran 's Jews love their Iranian identity and their culture , so threats and this immature political enticement will not achieve their aim of wiping out the identity of Iranian Jews .
"" More important than the welfare of Iranian Jewish families , it seems , is the value of Iranian Jews as a propaganda tool in Israel 's battle to persuade the world that coexistence with the Muslim world is impossible .
For those who want to engineer a clash of civilisations , the 3,000-year - old Jewish legacy in Iran is not something to be treasured , only another obstacle to war ."
2007-08-09,"The Iranian government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is a neo - liberal , free market , pro - privatisation , anti - trade union regime .
It is the mirror image of George Bush 's neo - con US - only many times worse .
Independent unions are banned , workers have few legal rights or protections , and union activists are regularly beaten , arrested , jailed and tortured .
Today , Thursday August 9 , is the international day of action in solidarity with Iran 's embattled trade union movement .
Protests will take place in more than 30 countries across the world , including outside the Iranian embassy in London .
This day of global action is organised by the International Transport Workers Federation ( ITF ) , with the backing of many individual unions and of Amnesty International .
The protests will highlight the recent re - arrest and jailing of Mansour Osanloo , president of the Tehran bus workers ' union , Sandikaye Kargarane Sherkate Vahed .
This is the third time in less than two years that Osanloo has been put behind bars , invariably on faked charges such as "" conspiring against national security "" .
Each time he has been jailed , international campaigns have helped secure his release .
Osanloo 's latest arrest took place on 10 July .
He is being held in Tehran 's notorious torture centre , Evin prison , without charge and without legal representation .
His crime ?
Campaigning for better wages and conditions for his fellow bus workers .
Another leading Iranian trade unionist who is also suffering state victimisation is Mahmoud Salehi .
A founding member of the Saqez Bakery Workers ' Association and of the Coordinating Committee to Form Workers ' Organisations , he was originally imprisoned in 2005 for organising a workers rally on May 1 2004 in the city of Saqez .
He was sentenced to five years jail and three years internal exile .
Eventually , he and his six co - defendants , collectively known as the Saqez Seven , won their appeals - only to be slapped with new trumped - up charges in 2006 .
In April this year , Salehi was again seized and is now incarcerated in Sanandaj jail .
Despite a serious kidney condition , the Iranian authorities refused to allow him to bring his medication into prison and are not providing him with the dialysis he needs to survive .
As a result , Salehi 's health is deteriorating to the point where he is now in danger of dying , which seems to be Tehran 's desired outcome .
Ahmadinejad realises that he does n't need to shoot or hang Salehi .
Medical neglect will do the job .
It is a de facto death sentence .
Osanloo and Salehi are not isolated victims of Tehran 's union - bashing .
Eleven other worker activists were recently sentenced to three months ' imprisonment , plus flogging , merely for taking part in a May Day rally in Sanandaj city .
Anti - union repression has intensified since 2003 , when a wave of strikes and demonstrations by workers and students was violently suppressed , with over 4,000 arrests .
The following year , during a copper mine strike , police shot dead four workers and wounded 40 others in the village of Khatoonabad and the city of Shahr - e Babak , in Kerman Province .
In January 2006 , over 800 striking Tehran bus workers - and some of their wives and children - were arrested and ill - treated .
President Ahmadinejad won the 2005 election on a promise of defending the poor .
He has n't delivered .
Iran 's unemployment rate is now 15 % , compared to only 11 % in 2006 .
Of young people aged between 15 and 19 years old , a third of those who want a job do n't have one , and around 20,000 homeless youths sleep rough on the streets of the major cities .
In 2005 , lawmaker Mohammad Abbasspour calculated that "" 90 % of the population are living under the poverty line and only 10 % of the people have access to social services provided by the government "" .
In the last two years , poverty and deprivation have got worse , despite the country 's fabulous oil wealth .
The repression of trade unions is par for the course in Iran .
The theocratic dictatorship is proudly pro - business and pro - privatisation .
It regards free trade unions as un - Islamic .
Under the 1990 labour law , independent trade unions are banned in favour of state - controlled Islamic labour councils - a corporate unionism not dissimilar to the labour laws of Hitler and Mussolini .
According to Mohammad Maljoo , a lecturer in the Faculty of Economics at Allameh Tabatabae University in Tehran , the far - reaching extent of state control over officially - sanctioned worker 's organisations and representatives is evident under section 130 of chapter six of the 1990 law .
It states that "" in order to propagate and disseminate Islamic culture and to defend the achievements of the Islamic Revolution , "" workers in industrial , agricultural , service and craft establishments may establish Islamic associations whose duties , powers and functions shall be drawn up by the ministry of the interior , the ministry of labour and social affairs and the Islamic propagation organisation , and approved by the council of ministries .
In other words , no autonomy and no independence .
As if this was not bad enough , plans have been drafted to amend the 1990 labour law to make it even easier for employers to dismiss workers , including on the grounds that there is a decline in the company 's productivity and that the firm needs to restructure or technologically upgrade .
This would tip the balance of power in the labour market further in favour of capital ; leaving employees weaker and more vulnerable than ever before .
President Ahmadinejad may pose as the great anti - American crusader , but his economic and union policies are not a million miles from the far right of the US Republican Party and the neo - liberal diktats of international financial institutions .
Very Islamic , not !"
2007-08-13,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has sacked his oil and industry ministers in an apparent attempt to tighten his grip on power while deflecting blame for failed economic policies .
In a major cabinet shake - up , Mr Ahmadinejad announced he had "" accepted the resignations "" of Kazem Vaziri - Hamaneh , and Alireza Tahmasbi respectively .
But despite the diplomatic wording , there appeared little doubt that the two men had been forced out , to be replaced by interim caretakers until permanent successors are appointed .
Their departures follow widespread criticism of the president for presiding over an economic landscape of rising inflation and high unemployment , in contrast to his pre - election promises to alleviate poverty and generate prosperity .
Mr Vaziri - Hamaneh , the oil minister , may have been a victim of the introduction of petrol rationing in June , although he is not believed to have been responsible .
The start of rationing triggered widespread unrest and the destruction of dozens of filling stations by angry protestors .
Iran , the world 's fourth - largest producer but which lacks refining capacity , said the move was essential to cut the costs of importing heavily subsidized petrol .
In recent days , Mr Ahmadinejad has rebuffed pressure to allow motorists to buy fuel at market prices , saying this will further stoke inflation .
Mr Vaziri - Hamaneh was the president 's fourth choice oil minister after parliament rejected his first three nominees .
His departure gives Mr Ahmadinejad a chance to install a more favoured candidate in one of the government 's most strategically vital posts at a time when MPs will be distracted with preparations for next March 's parliamentary elections .
The exit of Mr Tahmasbi as industry minister had been widely anticipated after he tendered his resignation letter last week .
His departure is thought to have been engineered after he resisted demands to replace ministry officials with the president 's hand - picked appointees .
Saeed Leylaz , an economic analyst , said the two ministers were victims of Mr Ahmadinejad 's policies .
"" This is because the policies of Mr Ahmadinejad have failed and he has not fulfilled his promises , "" he said .
"" He has to make a lot of noise to tell people that these are the guys responsible for the failures .
At the same time , he is trying to re - arrange his government in time for the next parliamentary elections . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad may now seek a radical shake - up in the foreign ministry after telling a group of Iranian ambassadors at the weekend that its structure needed to "" change in step with [ Iran 's ] global responsibilities "" .
He is also expected to replace the governor of Iran 's central bank , Ebrahim Sheibani , after he reportedly opposed a recent presidential decree cutting interest rates ."
2007-08-14,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , audaciously signalled his determination to counter US global power today by meeting his Afghan counterpart , Hamid Karzai , in open defiance of Washington 's wishes .
Mr Ahmadinejad led a high - ranking Iranian delegation to Kabul in a demonstration of growing Iranian influence in Afghanistan , where the US , Britain and other western powers are engaged in a bitter struggle with the Taliban .
The visit - Mr Ahmadinejad 's first to Afghanistan - was tailor - made to provoke alarm within the Bush administration , which accuses Tehran of destabilising its efforts while claiming that the Taliban is being armed with Iranian weapons .
Iran , which is mainly Shia , denies helping the Taliban , whose puritanical Sunni ideology it has condemned .
Today 's trip came just a week after Mr Karzai , a key US ally , publicly disagreed with the US president , George Bush , about the nature of Iran 's involvement in Afghanistan .
Addressing a joint White House press conference last week , Mr Bush said : "" I would be very cautious about whether or not the Iranian influence in Afghanistan is a positive force . ""
Mr Karzai flatly contradicted him by describing Iran as "" a helper and a solution "" .
Departing from Tehran 's Mehrabad airport , Mr Ahmadinejad paved the way to further deepen the disagreement by saying today 's talks would cover arrangements for establishing Afghanistan 's security and independence .
Describing Iran and Afghanistan as "" two brother nations with common interests , cultures and histories "" , he told reporters : "" The present condition of the region demands more exchange and negotiations between Tehran and Kabul .
In this trip economic cooperation , especially over Iran 's participation in Afghan development plans , will be discussed .
"" The trip is intended to put the seal on a range of Iranian - led reconstruction projects as well as consolidate areas of cooperation such as combating drug traffickers .
Iranian aid - worth a total of £ 125 m - has been provided for three projects , a water research centre , a dental college and equipment for Kabul 's medical university .
Illustrative of the trip 's importance from Iran 's perspective was the presence of several senior government figures in the president 's party , including Ali Larijani , secretary of the supreme national security council , Manouchehr Mottaki , the foreign minister , and the economy minister , Davoud Danesh - Jafari .
Iran gave Washington informal help in overthrowing the Taliban government following the US - led invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001 .
Months later , Mr Bush killed any prospect of a thaw in relations between Washington and Tehran by labelling Iran as a member of the "" axis of evil "" , along with Iraq and North Korea .
Despite US suspicions , Iran - which has one of the world 's highest drug addiction rates - argues that it has legitimate interests in combating the influx of heroin and opiates from the poppy fields of Afghanistan .
More than 3,000 Iranian police and security personnel have been killed in clashes with drug smugglers along the Afghan border since 1979 .
There are also at least 2 million Afghan refugees in Iran .
The issue has caused tensions recently after Tehran forcibly sent around 100,000 refugees back to Afghanistan , arguing that they were illegal migrants and a drain on the Iranian economy .
Today 's trip comes just days after another key US protege , the Iraqi prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki , visited Tehran .
The US accuses Iran of aiding Shia and other insurgents in Iran , a charge Tehran denies .
Senior Iranian officials used Mr al - Maliki 's visit to reiterate calls for a withdrawal of American forces from Iraq .
After departing from Kabul , Mr Ahmadinejad was due to fly to Turkmenistan before going on to Kyrgyzstan to attend a summit meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation , a body created by Russia and China to address regional security threats , foster economic integration and counter US influence in central Asia .
Iran has observer status with the organisation but is trying to form closer links .
Mr Ahmadinejad is expected to meet the Russian president , Vladimir Putin , and Hu Jintao , the president of China , at the meeting ."

Russia has vehemently objected to White House plans for missile defence bases in Poland and the Czech Republic , saying the network could be used against Russia and would wreck the strategic balance of forces in Europe .
But Mr Ahmadinejad said "" these intentions go beyond just one country .

But the Revolutionary Guards have made defending the Islamic system its duty and will increase its capabilities in this regard day by day .

It has its own navy , air force and ground troops , as well as specialist wings .

2007-08-17,"This is a selection of questions for John Pilger submitted by readers in our Open Thread .
ON HUGO CHAVEZ :
1 .
After meeting Hugo Chavez , do you have any idea why he ( a self - proclaimed socialist revolutionary ) has allied himself with one of the leaders of the most backwards , totalitarian , right - wing regimes in history ( that of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ) with Iran ?
Do you ever worry about Chavez 's irrational attitude ?
He recently stated that he wanted any foreign critic expelled from the country , that is not the act of a democracy .
( Tian )
Thanks for your question .
Venezuela 's alliance with Iran is entirely rational ; it 's based on the fact that they are two of the world 's leading oil producers .
All states seek alliances of convenience , and survival .
With oil the "" stupendous prize "" sought by the US and its allies , the alliance makes sense .
After all , Britain has allied itself with numerous regimes that qualify for your description of Iran but even more so .
The Shah 's regime , for example , scored the highest on Amnesty 's register as the most brutal on earth for many years , and it was not merely an ally but a creation of Britain and the United States .
It 's Chavez 's rationality that worries those who once controlled the destiny of Latin America .
As for his remark about expelling foreign critics , this was wrong of course and not meant and not untypical of the anger he feels to those who have tried to undermine and destroy his government .
Imagine if a foreign opposition leader had delivered the tirade against the US administration , in Washington , as one did in Caracas ?
It would n't have happened .
Two standards , alas .
2 .
How do you reconcile Chavez 's image in the US media as a dictator and his recent moves to shut down a television station ?
Can this not be interpreted as one of the steps to tyranny ?
( Gimli000 )
Chavez 's "" image "" in the US is entirely predictable .
It 's pretty much the same as the "" image "" of all those who stand up to Washington .
I remember well the "" image "" of the Australian prime minister , Gough Whitlam , who dared to object to US interference in his country 's affairs , and was abused , and undermined for his modest expressions of nationalism .
Chavez frightens the US because he is building economic bridges in his region , including using Venezuela 's oil revenue to get rid of IMF slavery .
As for RCTV , he did n't shut it down .
Its terrestrial licence expired and yet it 's still broadcasting by satellite and cable .
This is the station that took an active role in overthrowing the elected government in 2002 , and yet it was not prosecuted .
Imagine the BBC taking part in a coup against the prime minister or CBS doing the same in Washington .
Beware double standards .
3 .
What are your thoughts on Hugo Chavez 's recent steps towards ending term limits in Venezuela , ie removing the limit to his own term as president ?
( blether2 )
It 's too early to assess what Chavez 's intentions are .
This of course is what Franklin D Roosevelt did during the extraordinary years of the Depression and war .
ON DEMOCRACY : 4 .
Is democracy possible in a one - party state ?
( presidentD ) Is it possible in a society without an educated electorate ?
( wkrj )
The question above all surely is : what is democracy ?
What is fascinating about developments in Latin America is that the old preserve of the western liberal elite of the concept of democracy belonging to them , and them only is being challenged .
Rousseau wrote about popular sovereignty ; these days we call it participation .
In western democracies , especially Britain and the US , there is a crisis of participation .
Liberal elites have failed in defending the most fundamental civil liberties .
Latin America has long been a source of democratic experiment ; and what we see happening in Bolivia , Ecuador , Venezuela and other countries is an epic attempt at participatory democracy .
The debate in Venezuela , which is an electoral democracy , is the relationship between the state and communities .
In other words , the communities representing grassroots democracy can be the opposition to a state assuming unaccountable powers .
As for the question about an educated electorate , in my experience education never guarantees democracy ; on the contrary it can allow the "" training "" of a particular class who are beneficiaries of power .
5 .
What level of democracy do you consider the whole of Latin America to be at ?
( Scharlach )
Again , what is democracy ?
The Chartists made clear that democracy really did n't exist unless it had three components : electoral democracy , social democracy and economic democracy .
You can substitute the word "" justice "" in all three of those concepts .
I listened to Chavez describing the Chartists ' view of democracy and I have to say I have never before heard a leading politician invoke those principles .
I believe Latin America has a long way to go before it embraces all three , but a start has been made .
It would be good if a similar start , or renewal , was made in Britain !
6 .
Which country do you perceive to be more democratic : Colombia or Venezuela ?
( Sebas ) Are you serious ? !
7 .
Why , in your thought - provoking film , was there no mention at all of Michelle Bachelet ?
You heap praise on Hugo Chavez ( even though he recently threatened to throw any foreign dissidents out of Venezuela ) but Chilean president Bachelet , who was tortured under Pinochet and became the country 's first female president , does n't even get a mention ?
( Roquentin )
The film devotes a substantial section to Chile and the Bachelet government 's position is characterised , perhaps too briefly , I agree .
I do n't think it 's a valid to compare the personalities of Chavez and Bachelet as both are the products of their countries ' recent past , nor did I "" heap praise "" on Chavez ; I described his significance as the leader of arguably the most powerful popular movement in Latin America at present .
ON IMPERIALISM : 8 .
Through the 500 years of American and British imperialism and colonialism many euphemisms have been used to describe the massacres and the stealing of the poor 's resources .
You mention "" bringing democracy "" .
Others have been : "" bringing civilisation "" , "" bringing modernity "" , and the like .
Which of these euphemisms do you detest most ?
( Zalo )
Good question .
Like you , I always suspect and try to deconstruct loaded terms like "" democracy "" , "" civilisation "" , and especially "" modernity "" .
Which do I detest the most ?
Well , "" democracy "" is a noble term , whereas "" civilisation "" and "" modernity "" are well and truly contaminated and I try to avoid them at all costs .
For example , "" civilisation "" is an imperial product , suggesting the natives are uncivilised !
9 .
Who or what are the driving forces behind US imperialism ?
( bluezebra )
The United States is the product of imperialism , which its independent leaders continued , first against the Native Americans and African Americans , then in its declaration of a "" manifest destiny "" to rule the lesser breeds of its own hemisphere .
Race and Class are the major elements of imperialism , and US history has them in spades .
I 'm always amused when I read that the US only lost its "" innocence "" after World War II - not true .
10 .
In "" The War on Democracy "" you claim the US government were involved in the April 2002 coup that removed Chavez from power for just under two days .
How exactly were they involved ?
Are they still trying to remove Chavez from power ?
( Way1 ) CIA documents released under freedom of information legislation , leave no doubt that the US knew a coup was coming and approved it .
The principal way the US was involved was the support it gave elements in the Venezuelan military and , more important , the subversive work of USAID and the National Endowment for Democracy .
These organisations have taken over from the CIA in an attempt to be rather more subtle about undermining governments Washington does n't like .
Yes , they are still trying to remove Chavez from power ; and he fears assassination .
11 .
What impact do you think the rising price of oil is having upon Latin America ?
Do you think this might lead to them eventually getting the upper hand over the US ?
( finite187 )
Perhaps Chavez 's single most inflammatory act , as far as the US was concerned , was to influence OPEC and do his best to push up the price of oil .
The Bush administration was apoplectic .
This has given Venezuela very considerable power , especially as its "" heavy "" oil reserves may be the most extensive on earth .
I ca n't really predict where this will lead .
12 .
Why is hatred of America the only principle to which the far left ( including yourself ) is prepared to stay true ?
( goonsbury )
That 's a silly question .
ON YOURSELF :
13 .
Essentially you 're in the business of exploiting a range of humanitarian crises to score book sales , and you use the system that you despise to help you get rich and known in the process - capitalism ?
Response ?
( Bethany ) Have a good day !
14 .
Is there any position that you have taken or defended in recent times that you now regret ?
( noheroes )
I never really have much time for the concept of regret .
All our lives have regrettable moments and decisions -
so I think I 'll play my Edith Piaff favourite again .
15 .
In your travels you must meet some unsung people who stand out because of how they benefit the society around them - who springs to mind ?
( misteruseless )
My first book was called Heroes and dedicated to the very unsung people you mention .
There are so many of them .
Most are people who live in extremely harsh situations , yet survive and sometimes overcome against the odds .
One comes to mind : Mavis Mendez , aged 94 , who lives in a very poor barrio in Caracas and whom I watched learning to write her name for the first time .
16 .
Would you rather be born poor in Cuba or the US ?
( notsureofmyname )
The arbitrary nature of human beings is that we do n't have a choice of where we are born and once it happens , that 's it !
Read John Pilger 's comment piece from today 's paper here"
2007-08-28,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , today said Tehran was ready to fill an imminent power vacuum in Iraq in remarks that can be seen as a direct challenge to the US . ""
The political power of the occupiers is collapsing rapidly , "" Mr Ahmadinejad said at a press conference in Tehran . ""
Soon , we will see a huge power vacuum in the region .
Of course , we are prepared to fill the gap , with the help of neighbours and regional friends like Saudi Arabia , and with the help of the Iraqi nation . ""
His remarks will do little to dispel US fears that Iran is seeking to increase its regional influence , taking advantage of Iraq 's weakened state .
Mr Ahmadinejad also accused the US of interfering in Iraq 's internal affairs after Washington said efforts by the country 's prime minister , Nuri al - Maliki , to reconcile the country 's divided Sunnis , Shiites and Kurds were not enough .
"" They rudely say ( the Iraqi ) prime minister and the constitution must change , "" Mr Ahmadinejad said .
"" Who are you ?
Who has given you the right ? ""
Mr Ahamadinejad was speaking amid a debate on the US on whether to continue the military "" surge "" that began in February .
Some senior Republicans such as senator John Warner are calling for troop withdrawals .
Others argue that the injection of 30,000 troops has produced more progress than anticipated and that the surge should continue .
A report by the US commander in Iraq , General David Petraeus , expected next month , is expected to recommend the continued deployment of large numbers of US forces in the country .
But the picture for the US has been complicated by Britain 's decision to reduce its number of troops in the south .
Jack Keane , a retired US general , said last week that the security situation was deteriorating in Basra and that the US might have to redeploy to the south if the British withdrew , a contention that the foreign secretary David Miliband today rejected .
The US has consistently accused Iran of providing help to Shia extremists in Iraq who have taken a deadly toll of American forces through sophisticated roadside bombs .
The US is considering declaring Iran 's Revolutionary Guards a terrorist force for its support of Shia militants in order to ratchet up the pressure on Iran , already under UN sanctions because of its nuclear programme .
Mr Ahmadinejad said Iran would respond to such a step .
"" They know that any action against the Iranian nation would be faced with a proper response , "" Mr Ahmadinejad , himself a former Guards commander , told reporters .
But he also said he believed it was "" highly unlikely that the American government will take such an illogical approach ...
it would be a joke I guess .
"" In his press conference , the Iranian leader reiterated that Tehran has achieved full proficiency in the nuclear fuel cycle and warned the west that dialogue and friendship - not threats - were the right way to deal with Iran . ""
Today , Iran is a nuclear Iran , "" Mr Ahmadinejad said .
"" That means , it fully possesses the whole nuclear fuel cycle . ""
He added , however , that Iran was committed to a "" peaceful path "" in pursuing its nuclear programme .
His comments followed an announcement yesterday by the International Atomic Energy Agency which said that Tehran was offering some cooperation in the agency 's investigation of an alleged secret uranium processing project linked by US intelligence to a nuclear arms programme ."
2007-08-28,"George Bush today ramped up the war of words between the US and Iran , accusing the Iranian regime of threatening to place the Middle East under the shadow of a nuclear holocaust and revealing that he had authorised US military commanders in Iraq to "" confront Tehran 's murderous activities "" .
In a speech designed to shore up American public opinion behind his increasingly unpopular strategy in Iraq , the president reserved his strongest words for the regime of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , which he accused of openly supporting violent forces within Iraq .
Iran , he said , was responsible for training extremist Shia factions in the country which it supplied with arms and weapons , including sophisticated roadside bombs .
He referred specifically to 240 mm rockets that he said had been made in Iran this year and smuggled into Iraq by Iranian agents .
"" Iran has long been a source of trouble in the region .
Iran 's active pursuit of technology that could lead to nuclear weapons threatens to put a region already known for instability and violence under the shadow of a nuclear holocaust . ""
The blunt terms in which Mr Bush portrayed the Iranian threat , and his open threat of military confrontation with Tehran involving US troops based in Iraq , elevates the increasingly tense standoff between Washington and Tehran to a new level .
His speech also contained the implicit desire on Mr Bush 's part for regime change , calling for "" an Iran whose government is accountable to its people , instead of to leaders who promote terror and pursue the technology that could be used to develop nuclear weapons "" .
Equally menacing words emanated from Tehran today , where Mr Ahmadinejad said US influence in the region was collapsing so fast that a power vacuum would soon be created .
"" Of course , we are prepared to fill the gap , "" he said .
Though the Iranian leader said he backed the leadership of the Iraqi prime minister , Nuri al - Maliki , and welcomed the involvement of Saudi Arabia , his offer to occupy the space the Americans might leave behind is unlikely to cool emotions in Washington .
He went on to deride the possibility of the US pursuing military action in Iran , saying it was in no position to do so , and claiming that Iran had already acquired enriched nuclear fuels - though they would only be used for peaceful purposes . ""
Today , Iran is a nuclear Iran , "" he said .
In a further cause of tension , Mr Bush accused the Quds force within Iran 's revolutionary guards of leading the supply chain to Iraqi extremist groups .
As the Guardian revealed earlier this month , the Bush administration is preparing to declare the 125,000-strong Revolutionary Guard Corps a "" global terrorist organisation "" - a move that would be seen as provocative within Tehran .
Mr Bush talked of his bullish determination to "" take the fight to the enemy "" in the carefully choreographed setting of a veterans ' convention in Reno , Nevada , was the second of a two - part appeal by the president to shore up public support for his flagging strategy on Iraq .
In the first speech , made last week , he controversially invoked Vietnam to argue that quitting Iraq now could put the lives of millions of innocent civilians at risk .
The president today vowed to persevere with his controversial military policy in Iraq , insisting that political and security progress was being made , despite a rising tide of dissent even from high up within his own Republican party .
"" Our strategy is this : Every day we work to protect the American people .
We will fight them over there so that we do n't have to fight them in the United States of America , "" he said .
The twin speeches were intended as preparation for a crucial series of debates on Iraq that will dominate Washington for the next few weeks .
In two weeks time , the senior general in Iraq , General David Petraeus , and the president 's envoy to the country , Ryan Crocker , will give two days of testimony in which they are likely to argue that the "" surge "" is having some beneficial impact on security levels , though political progress lags behind .
Under the current policy , US troop numbers in Iraq have risen by 30,000 to about 165,000 .
As the climax of these intense hearings , Mr Bush himself will present his latest assessment on whether a set of benchmarks mandated by Congress are being met on the ground in Iraq .
Today 's speech was the latest clear indication that he will resist any attempt to change course in the prosecution of the war , despite mounting pressure from the now - dominant Democrats in Congress and from influential Republicans .
In the most recent defection from the course dictated by the White House , Senator John Warner of Virginia , a former navy secretary , said this week that he is considering backing the Democrats in their push to force the withdrawal of troops .
Mr Bush 's latest attempt to reassure the American people that the war is moving in the right direction came on another tumultuous day in Iraq .
Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims attending a Shia festival in Kerbala were ordered to leave the city after intense fighting broke out , reportedly between warring Shia factions .
At least 35 people have been killed since Monday , mostly police officers engaging in the battle ."
2007-08-29,"One minute , he 's denouncing George Bush ,
the next he 's accepting an invitation for a biopic from Oliver Stone .
No one can accuse Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of leading a dull life .
Barely had the dust settled on the war of words between the Iranian president and his counterpart in Washington yesterday than Mr Ahmadinejad was fielding questions about his prospects in Hollywood .
To go from a pronouncement about Iran 's nuclear future to a discussion about his own potential celluloid future without stuttering was quite an achievement .
Quizzed about Stone 's desire to make a documentary about his life , Mr Ahmadinejad said : "" I have no objection , generally speaking . ""
Stone has a history of documentaries on American figures of hate .
In 2003 he made a film on Fidel Castro which was praised on the left for debunking the myth of a Cuban monster and condemned by the right for soft soaping him .
That Mr Ahmadinejad should have no objections to being the next subject of a Stone documentary comes as a surprise , as the last word heard on the matter was a rejection .
Last month the Iranian president 's media adviser said Mr Ahmadinejad was against the movie .
"" It is right that this person [ Stone ] is considered part of the opposition in the US , but opposition in the US is a part of the great satan .
We believe that the American cinema lacks culture and art , "" he said .
To accuse one of America 's most famous artists of coming from a country with no art is one thing ; to accuse him of being part of the great satan quite another .
Stone shot back : "" I have been called a lot of things , but never a great satan .
"" I wish the Iranian people well , and only hope their experience with an inept , rigid ideologue president goes better than ours . ""
Still , all that bad feeling seems to have passed , and lines of communication have been reopened .
Could there be a lesson here for Mr Bush ?"

According to reports from Baghdad last night , a group of Iranians were detained last night in a raid by US troops on a hotel in the city .
Of 10 people arrested , seven were said to be Iranian , including an employee of the Iranian embassy and six members of Iran 's electricity ministry in Iraq to discuss contracts for electric power stations .
It was not immediately clear why the men had been arrested , or where they had been taken .
The US military would only say the action was part of an on - going operation .

2007-08-30,"There is no doubt that Iran is feeling isolated .
In his first major foreign policy speech , French President Nicolas Sarkozy said that diplomacy was the only way the international community could avoid making a "" catastrophic "" choice of either "" the Iranian bomb or the bombing of Iran "" .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad dismissed the remarks by saying that Sarkozy was showing his "" inexperience "" on foreign affairs .
This week , George Bush announced , during a speech to a cheering audience at the 89th American Legion convention , that he has authorised American military commanders in Iraq to "" confront Tehran 's murderous activities "" .
American forces in Iraq acted by arresting seven Iranians in a Baghdad hotel .
Iran responded by saying that it was ready to fill the vacuum that has been created by the situation in Iraq .
I visited Tehran a few weeks ago to try to get a personal insight into the mindset of Iran 's politicians .
If the Middle East is a complex jigsaw puzzle , then Iran is a Rubik 's cube .
Yet we need to attempt to understand this puzzle .
For long periods in our history , Iran has been a close ally of the UK in the Middle East .
Even today we face many of the same challenges .
The rise of al - Qaida and its threats to the region and beyond are a major source of concern for the Iranian government .
The scourge of drug addiction , especially heroin ( Iran has several million known addicts ) is very high on the political agenda .
The continued instability in Iraq and the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan are also areas where success would be in the mutual interests of both countries .
Yet today tensions are high and relationships poor .
Iran stands accused of worsening the instability in Iraq with Iranian - made explosive devices implicated in the deaths of British soldiers and civilians .
Iran 's continued support for Hizbullah is seen as an obstacle to a settlement of the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians .
Worst of all , the insistence of the Iranian leadership on the continued programme of uranium enrichment risks bringing Iran into conflict with the entire international community .
The Conservative policy group on security , chaired by Pauline Neville Jones , recently reported that Britain was under - investing in the diplomatic and political relationships that would be increasingly important in a more multi - polar world .
It has been reported for example , that we can read the number plate of every car in Iran by satellite , yet we have a poor understanding of the internal dynamics of Iranian politics .
Yet this understanding is vital for sensible policy - making .
David Cameron has made it clear that we must seek to fully engage with those whose interests conflict with ours to ensure Britain 's national security .
Even at the height of the cold war we sought to have a full dialogue with the Soviet Union and increased our diplomatic presence in Moscow .
It was against this backdrop that I recently accepted an invitation to visit Iran , notwithstanding our anger at the way the Iranian authorities recently dealt with the Royal Navy personnel who were illegally held in the Gulf .
Arriving in Tehran , I was not sure what to expect .
The spectacular mountain backdrop to the city was a surprise , as was the dress of many young men whose baseball caps and clothing would not have looked out of place in Los Angeles .
Less of a surprise was the fact that the city looked as though it had seen better times and was in need of a good lick of paint .
Politically we were treated to a good representation of security , defence and foreign policy .
We met with deputies from religious minorities and women parliamentarians , clearly designed to give us an impression of the inclusive nature of Iranian society .
They seemed genuinely to welcome the chance to talk to someone who had been openly critical of the regime and we had what the Foreign Office would no doubt describe as "" a full and frank exchange of views "" .
We discussed Afghanistan , where the Iranian government is particularly critical of the failure to deal with the poppy crops .
In many ways their position was closer to that of the Americans who see the anti - narcotics mission in Afghanistan as being of prime importance .
On Iraq they were , unsurprisingly , in complete denial about any Iranian involvement in the insurgency .
Rather , they blamed Saudi Arabia , Jordan and Syria for their lack of commitment to a stable democratic government in Iraq .
Hizbullah , they claimed , was a legitimate part of Lebanese politics and it was clear they intended to continue their support .
It came as no surprise that the greatest disagreement between us , and the issue which took up most time , was Iran 's nuclear programme .
Throughout the visit Iranians constantly pointed out that they are spending 40 % of GDP on fuel subsidy , a situation that clearly can not continue .
Petrol prices are currently only around 10 cents per litre and even modest attempts to deal with the situation has resulted in political unrest .
This is the most common justification given for the need to create alternative energy sources .
Time and again it was pointed out that Iran has an undeniable right to follow a civilian nuclear programme under the non - proliferation treaty .
But to do so , Iran has to allow unfettered access to IAEA inspectors and to fully comply with previous UN resolutions , which have the force of law .
It is a point that William Hague has made time and time again .
When it was pointed out that the sanctions were not simply supported by Britain and the US but had been backed by Russia and China , this inconvenient fact was just ignored .
The Russians , they said , would have to finish their work on a nuclear power plant because they were contractually obliged to do so and to fail in this would dent Russian pride .
I doubt very much if this is how the situation is seen in the Gazprom - influenced Kremlin .
Everyone we met understood that it was not in Iran 's interests to see further financial sanctions introduced ; their economy would probably sustain further damage .
Yet there was an intransigence , even defiance and arrogance , which seemed destined to take them on a path that was against their national interests .
The mindset of "" the whole world is against Iran "" was palpable throughout and is unlikely to predispose to a speedy resolution of the nuclear question .
Even when it was pointed out that it would be in no one 's interests to see a nuclear arms race in the Middle East , the reply tended to be that other countries were probably already enriching uranium but , unlike Iran , they were not being victimised by the US .
The situation in Iran is difficult to interpret , as there are clearly differing signals coming from different parts of the government apparatus .
Whether these mixed signals are intentional or whether it is simply an indication of the chaotic nature of the regime is difficult to tell .
The constant desire to play the victim and to see British and American plots round every corner makes dialogue difficult .
The failure to recognise that Iran is in conflict not just with the west , but with the entire global community , over its nuclear programme , shows a worrying detachment from reality .
I really wanted to come away from Iran with renewed hope that common sense would prevail and that simmering tensions could be reduced .
There are certainly some who understand the gravity of the situation and the need to find pragmatic solutions .
It is always good to talk and it is right that we should continue .
But it was hard to leave Tehran without an enduring feeling of resignation , even pessimism .
Pity ."
2007-09-03,"Iran said yesterday an important goal had been reached in its quest for uranium enrichment , raising fears that it could have enough nuclear material for an atomic bomb within a year .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was quoted by state television as saying that despite UN economic sanctions , Iran had "" taken another step in the nuclear progress and launched more than 3,000 centrifuge machines "" .
The number of centrifuges - critical in building a nuclear bomb - is significantly higher than recent estimations by the International Atomic Energy Agency , leading to speculation that Iran may be exaggerating its capabilities for propaganda purposes .
Tehran said in April that it was operating 3,000 centrifuges but the IAEA found that only 328 centrifuges were active at the underground Natanz enrichment facility in central Iran .
Last week inspectors said the enrichment programme had slowed and the country was now cooperating .
Findings also suggested that Iran had produced only negligible amounts of nuclear fuel with its centrifuges , far below the level usable for nuclear warheads .
But yesterday 's announcement looks set to fuel growing tensions with Washington and its EU allies .
Last week President George Bush claimed that Iran 's nuclear agenda would put the Middle East under the shadow of "" nuclear holocaust "" .
Iran has faced economic sanctions and three UN resolutions for refusing to cooperate with IAEA inspectors and curtail its nuclear plans .
Further sanctions are possible when the UN security council meets this month .
Western experts say 3,000 centrifuges running smoothly for long periods at supersonic speeds could make enough enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb in about a year ."
2007-09-05,"Though the election of Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as chairman of Iran 's Assembly of Experts is a memorable event , it is unlikely to lead to power struggle between him and the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
The chairmanship was more a promotion for Rafsanjani than a new position : since the establishment of the assembly in 1982 , he had been its deputy chairman .
Even so , it is remarkable how 74-year - old Rafsanjani - whose religious title of hojatalislam ( "" proof of Islam "" ) is one rank lower than that of ayatollah (
"" sign of Allah "" ) - has bounced back from his crushing defeat in the presidential contest by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad two years ago .
This is due partly to Ahamdinajad 's failure to put oil money on the table of poor Iranians as he had promised , and partly to Iranian voters ' proclivity to rectify a lurch to extremism , be it of the conservative or liberal hue .
By securing the highest number of votes in the election to the Assembly of Experts , held every eight years , Rafsanjani recouped some of the lustre he had lost in the 2005 presidential poll .
The Assembly of Experts , with tenure of eight years , is a constitutional body authorised to elect or dismiss the supreme leader .
This invalidates the view held by many westerners that Iran 's supreme leader is elected for life .
His tenure lasts as long as the assembly .
Each new assembly must either endorse the incumbent or elect a new supreme leader .
What is more , the 86-membr Assembly of Experts appoints a committee to judge whether or not the supreme leader 's performance is within the constitutional limits , and whether or not it is generally "" satisfactory "" .
During its six - monthly sessions , which are held in the holy city of Qom and are closed to the public , the assembly discusses the committee 's report , and forms an opinion .
But neither the names of the committee members nor the contents of their reports are published .
It is vaguely assumed by the insiders that only if the committee were to find the supreme leader 's performance unsatisfactory would it be expected to issue a statement to that effect .
Under the somnolent leadership of Ayatollah Ali Meshkini , who died in July , the assembly was slack in overseeing the supreme leader 's performance .
Going by Rafsanjani 's speech before his election , that is likely to change .
He pointed out that there was no legal or Islamic barrier to the assembly interfering in "" the current issues of the country at the highest level and to be more active in various areas "" .
The title Assembly of Experts implies "" experts on Islam "" .
That is why since its inception it has consisted exclusively of clerics .
It is the Council of Guardians ( of Islam and the Constitution ) which vets the candidates for the assembly .
Often it rejects more than half of them either because they refuse to take the obligatory examination to prove their theological expertise or because they fail the test .
In 1998 , however , heeding the calls for liberalisation from different quarters , the council ruled that non - clerics , male or female , could be candidates if they met the high standards of religious expertise .
Unsurprisingly , all 37 male and nine female non - clerical candidates failed the test .
However , the principle that candidates for the assembly do not have to be mullah and male has been established .
Iran 's supreme leader is the final arbiter of authority .
He is the commander - in - chief and has the right to make war or peace .
Equally important , he is required to maintain a balance between the executive , legislative and judicial organs of the state .
Following Ahmadinejad 's election as president in June 2005 , all three state organs came to be led by conservatives .
Khamenei noted the radical change and acted to bring about some balance .
He publicly urged Rafsanjani to stay as the ( nominated ) head of the Expediency Council , a position he has occupied since 1997 .
In that capacity he acts as a mediator to resolve differences between president , parliament and the Guardians Council .
- and a consultant to the supreme leader on the formation of general policies .
Four months later Khamenei issued a decree that gave the Expediency Council a mandate to oversee the three branches of the government as well as the military and state media .
He thus enhanced Rafsanjani 's authority .
So now , as chairman of the Assembly of Experts , Rafsanjani will be expected to refrain from challenging Khamenei , directly or indirectly , while infusing some life into the Assembly of Experts ."
2007-09-19,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , suffered an embarrassing blow to his prestige when his own party attacked him for adopting a jocular tone towards inflation at a time of rampant price rises .
Now the Islamic Revolution Devotees Society , a fundamentalist grouping of revolutionary veterans co - founded by Mr Ahmadinejad himself , has added its voice to a rising chorus of economic discontent by warning the president that spiralling living costs are hurting the poor and undermining his stated goal of social justice .
The society said the government was to blame because it had embarked on extravagant state - funded projects while failing to control the money supply . ""
Unrestrained inflation increases the pressure on the weak and leads to the poor becoming poorer as owners of non - monetary assets get richer , "" it said in a newly published economic report .
"" The result is counter to the goals , plans and slogans of Dr Ahmadinejad 's government . ""
The report also accused Mr Ahmadinejad and other officials of refusing to acknowledge the problem , and of making light of it .
"" Sometimes some high - rank government officials deny the growth of prices and deal with them through making jokes , "" it said .
"" To deny the current inflation or ignore it through jokes is totally unacceptable . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad has frequently dismissed complaints of rising prices as the invention of a hostile media , and blamed "" secret networks "" for rising house prices .
This year , he responded to MPs ' protests over the rising price of tomatoes by urging them to visit his local greengrocer in Narmak , in east Tehran .
Mr Ahmadinejad also answered recent criticism of his policies by saying he took advice from his local butcher .
"" There is an honourable butcher in our neighbourhood who knows all the economic problems of the people .
I get my economic information from him , "" he said .
The latest report implicitly criticised his contemptuous view of economics by describing it as a "" specialised science "" and warning that Iran 's inflationary problems could not be solved by "" ad hoc decisions "" .
That may partly refer to one of Mr Ahmadinejad 's most controversial recent moves : ordering banks to cut interest rates to 12 % - below inflation , which is estimated at between 20 % and 30 % .
Mr Ahmadinejad , an engineer with a PhD in traffic management , is on record as saying : "" I pray to God I never know about economics . ""

2007-09-20,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has triggered a diplomatic furore over his request to lay a wreath at the World Trade Centre site to commemorate the September 11 attacks .
Even before setting foot on US soil for the upcoming UN general assembly , the Iranian leader has managed to ruffle American feathers by asking to visit what is considered a sacred site .
Mr Ahmadinejad , who is to due to arrive on Sunday to address the assembly , had asked New York city and the US secret service earlier this month for permission to visit Ground Zero .
A statement by the New York police commissioner , Raymond Kelly , that said the city was considering the application , prompted outrage from politicians , quickly resulting in a refusal .
Rudy Giuliani , who was mayor during the attacks and is now a Republican presidential candidate , branded Mr Ahmadinejad 's request "" outrageous "" and described him as "" a man who has made threats against America and Israel ; is harbouring [ Osama ] bin Laden 's son and other al - Qaida leaders ; is shipping arms to Iraqi insurgents ; and is pursuing the development of nuclear weapons "" .
Hillary Clinton , the Democratic presidential candidate , said it was "" unacceptable "" for Mr Ahmadinejad "" to visit the site of the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil in our nation 's history "" .
Mohammad Mir Ali Mohammadi , a spokesman for the Iranian mission to the UN , described the refusal as unfortunate . ""
President Ahmadinejad intended to lay a wreath at the site of Ground Zero in order to pay tribute to the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 .
We are hopeful that we can still work something out with the police department . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad is scheduled to speak at Columbia University on Monday at a forum of world leaders organised by the college 's school of international and public affairs .
It promises to be a raucous affair .
The Iranian leader has been dogged by protesters during past visits .
A year ago , after he was invited to address the same Columbia forum , the invitation was withdrawn because his appearance might not "" reflect the academic values of the event "" .
The president 's visit to the US comes amid intense speculation of a possible American strike at Iran 's nuclear facilities over Tehran 's refusal to halt its uranium enrichment programme .
The US is trying to drum up support for a third round of UN sanctions against Iran , with France on board , but with Russia and China reluctant to pressure Iran further .
Apart from the nuclear issue , Washington has stepped up accusations against Iran over its alleged support for Shia militants in Iraq who are targeting American soldiers with explosive devices .
In a television appearance earlier this week , Mr Ahmadinejad said his country wanted peace and friendship with the US , despite mounting tensions .
The US has also denied a visa to Iran 's UN ambassador in Geneva to attend next week 's general assembly meeting because he was allegedly involved in the 1979 US hostage crisis in Tehran , a UN official said ."
2007-09-20,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has suffered an embarrassing blow to his prestige after his own party attacked him for adopting a jocular tone towards inflation at a time of rampant price rises .
The Islamic Revolution Devotees Society - a fundamentalist grouping of revolutionary veterans co - founded by Mr Ahmadinejad - has added its voice to a rising chorus of economic discontent by warning the president that spiralling living costs are hurting the poor and undermining his stated goal of social justice .
The society says the government is to blame because it embarked on extravagant projects while failing to control the money supply . ""
Unrestrained inflation increases the pressure on the weak and leads to the poor becoming poorer as owners of non - monetary assets get richer , "" it says in an economic report .
"" The result is counter to the goals , plans and slogans of Dr Ahmadinejad 's government . ""
The report also accuses Mr Ahmadinejad and other officials of refusing to acknowledge the problem and of making light of it with inappropriate jokes .
It says : "" Sometimes some high - ranking government officials deny the growth of prices and deal with them through making jokes .
To deny the current inflation or ignoring it through jokes is totally unacceptable . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad has frequently dismissed complaints of rising prices as the invention of a hostile media and blamed "" secret networks "" for rising house prices .
This year he responded to MPs ' protests over the rising price of tomatoes by urging them to visit his local greengrocer in Narmak in east Tehran .
He also answered recent criticism of his policies by saying he took advice from his local butcher .
"" There is an honourable butcher in our neighbourhood who knows all the economic problems of the people .
I get my economic information from him , "" he said .
The latest report implicitly criticises his contemptuous view of economics by describing it as a "" specialised science "" and says Iran 's inflationary problems can not be solved by "" ad hoc decisions "" .
That may partly refer to one of Mr Ahmadinejad 's most controversial recent moves in which he ordered banks to cut interest rates to 12 % - below inflation , which is estimated at between 20 % and 30 % .

2007-09-21,"A request by the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , for an official tour of Ground Zero while he is at the United Nations next week met a collective response that was classically New Yorker : Fuhgeddaboutit !
The New York police department turned down Mr Ahmadinejad , citing security concerns and continuing construction at the scene of the September 11 terror attacks .
But the White House and the state department were less concerned with sparing the Iranian leader 's feelings .
"" I can understand why they would not want somebody who is running a country who is a state sponsor of terror down there at the site , "" President George Bush told a White House press conference yesterday .
The US ambassador to the UN , Zalmay Khalilzad , denounced Mr Ahmadinejad 's request as a publicity stunt : "" Iran can demonstrate its seriousness about concern with regard to terrorism by taking concrete actions .
"" The tabloid press was even blunter . ""
Go to hell ! ""
read the cover of the New York Daily News yesterday , plastering a red no - entry symbol over Mr Ahmadinejad 's picture .
It seemed unlikely from the start that Mr Ahmadinejad , who has denied both the Holocaust and the involvement of terrorists in the destruction of the World Trade Centre , would visit Ground Zero like any other dignitary .
In May last year , the Iranian leader wrote Mr Bush a letter suggesting that 9/11 was an inside job . ""
Could it be planned and executed without coordination with intelligence and security services - or their extensive infiltration ? "" he asked . ""
Of course this is just an educated guess .
Why have the various aspects of the attacks been kept secret ? ""
But on Wednesday the New York police commissioner , Raymond Kelly , said the police department was considering a request from the Iranian leader to lay a wreath at the site where the twin towers once stood .
Media commentators were aghast - and America 's top contenders for the White House in 2008 , who are both from New York , soon waded into the fray . ""
Assisting Ahmadinejad in touring Ground Zero - hallowed ground for all Americans - is outrageous , "" the former mayor of New York and Republican candidate , Rudy Giuliani , said .
Hillary Clinton , the senator from New York who is frontrunner for the Democratic nomination , said it would be "" unacceptable "" for Mr Ahmadinejad to set foot on the site .
Mohammad Mir Ali Mohammadi , a spokesman for the Iranian diplomatic mission at the UN , told the Associated Press : "" President Ahmadinejad intended to lay a wreath at the site of Ground Zero in order to pay tribute to the victims of the terrorists attack . """
2007-09-22,"Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is poised to deliver a defiant address to the United Nations general assembly this week amid a storm of opposition to his visit to New York and growing international alarm over his country 's nuclear ambitions .
On the eve of his departure from Tehran , the Iranian military yesterday showed off a new long - range ballistic missile called the Ghadr - Farsi for ' power ' .
In a speech marking the event , Ahmadinejad shrugged off US and regional concerns about Iran 's more assertive role , saying : ' Iran is an influential power in the region and the world should know that this power has always served peace , stability , brotherhood and justice . '
But with the Iranian leader expected to arrive in New York on Sunday for the annual meeting of the 192-member assembly , diplomats said that his visit was likely to raise the temperature yet again in the debate surrounding international moves to curb Iran 's nuclear enrichment programme .
Members of the UN security council have been informally consulting on the possibility of a new and tougher resolution in the wake of Iran 's refusal to abandon its ambitions to produce enriched uranium .
Last week , the French Foreign Minister , Bernard Kouchner , warned the Iranians that if diplomatic efforts failed to dissuade Iran from becoming a nuclear power , war was a possibility .
Speaking to The Observer , the British Foreign Secretary , David Miliband , played down that prospect , and interpreted Kouchner 's remarks as a move to convey to Iran ' the depth of feelings ' about ' the dangers of setting off a nuclear arms race in the Middle East ' .
Miliband insisted that Britain and its EU allies were ' 100 per cent committed to a diplomatic solution .
But when asked whether he thought the issue ' will be solved by diplomatic means ' , he stopped short of saying yes .
He replied instead : ' I think it can be solved by diplomatic means . '
Ahmadinejad 's visit has already sparked bitter opposition in New York .
He has been forced to cancel plans to ' pay respects to the American nation ' at the Ground Zero site of the 11 September terror attack on the World Trade Centre , amid protests from relatives of some of the victims .
On Monday , Columbia University is scheduled to play host to Ahmadinejad for a question - and - answer session with students and faculty - despite calls from leading political figures , including a number of US presidential candidates , for the school to cancel the event .
The university 's president , Lee Bollinger , has said he will introduce the event with a ' series of sharp challenges ' to Ahmadinejad on issues ranging from his ' denial of the Holocaust ' and his ' call for the destruction of the State of Israel ' to Iranian nuclear ambitions ."
2007-09-24,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , today appeared to be unworried about the prospect of a US or Israeli air strike on his country , dismissing talk of war as a propaganda tool .
Facing widespread protests on the first day of a visit to New York for a United Nations general assembly meeting , he told journalists any country wanting to go to war against Iran would need a good legal reason to do so and such an excuse did not exist .
Iran had not broken any international agreements by developing nuclear power , he said .
He added that the US should have learned the lesson of past mistakes , referring to the invasion of Iraq .
He dismissed the French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , who had raised the prospect of war , as immature .
Protesters gathered at all the locations Mr Ahmadinejad visited yesterday .
The Daily News declared "" the Evil has Landed "" , and the New York Post called him the "" Madman Iran Prez "" and told him to "" Go to Hell "" if he went anywhere near ground zero , as he had planned .
The centrepiece of his day was a speech at New York 's Columbia university .
Earlier , he was asked by journalists about the threat of war at the National Press Centre in Washington , in a video - conference call from New York .
He said : "" Talk of war is basically a propaganda tool .
People who talk about it have to bring a legal reason .
Officials who talk about it should be pressured about what to say and what not to say .
They should not endanger world security . ""
US and European diplomats have been privately warning over the last month that the prospect of an air strike against Iran next year has grown .
The US has said it will not allow Iran to have nuclear weapons .
Standing outside the UN , Mr Ahmadinejad , in his address to journalists , opened with a 20-minute , at times rambling , statement about God , human development and corruption .
But he put into the mix a warning to the US that it could not prevent "" the pursuit of science""- Iran 's nuclear research - adding : "" No one has the right to take this away . ""
He denied that Iran abused human rights , saying : "" People in Iran are very joyous , happy people .
They 're very free in expressing what they think . ""
To sceptical laughter from the assembled journalists , he described Iranian women as "" the freest in the world "" .
Asked about US claims at the weekend that Iran is smuggling surface - to - air missiles into Iraq for use against American forces , Mr Ahmadinejad denied it , adding that even if it were true , a few weapons would not make much difference to the US , which was already defeated in Iraq .
"" We think the military should seek an answer to its defeat in Iraq elsewhere , "" he said .
On Broadway , outside Columbia University , clusters of demonstrators and counter - demonstrators vied to win the attention of the press . ""
A man like this who 's creating tension and creating ill - will , why should be given a forum at one of the oldest universities in America ?
"" asked Albert Marshak , a 78-year - old New Yorker . ""
Let him go and speak in the streets , or in Madison Square Garden , not here . ""
A New York fireman said : "" He should n't be here .
He 's a terrorist supporter .
He 's a maniac . ""
Asked if he believed that Mr Ahmadinejad had any responsiblity for the September 11 attacks , the fireman replied : "" Anything 's possible . ""
There were as many antiwar protesters as anti - Ahmadinejad demonstrators .
A communist group had unfurled a big orange banner claiming : "" Ahmadinejad is bad .
Bush is worse .
Humanity needs another way .
No war on Iran . ""
"" This is a very dangerous situation , "" said Joan Hirsch , the group 's spokeswoman .
"" People have a responsibility to speak out on the crimes committed in our names . """
2007-09-24,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , insisted again today he did not expect US military action against his country , as he prepared to address a university audience in New York ahead of the UN general assembly meeting .
Talk of invasion was fuelled by US political imperatives and problems in Iraq , he told the AP news agency in an interview .
"" That is not how I see it , "" the president said , when asked if Washington was preparing military action .
"" I believe that some of the talk in this regard arises first of all from anger .
Secondly , it serves the electoral purposes domestically in this country .
Third , it serves as a cover for policy failures over Iraq . ""
Reaction to Mr Ahmadinejad 's presence in the US has so far been extremely negative , with New York 's Daily News carrying the front page headline : "" The Evil Has Landed "" .
The paper reported outrage among American critics , who said a Holocaust denier should not be given a platform at Columbia University , one of the most respected academic institutions in the US .
Mainstream Jewish groups were among those who condemned the university 's invitation to the Iranian leader to speak at its World Leaders Forum later tonight .
Mr Ahmadinejad can expect mass demonstrations that threaten to bring New York 's Upper West Side to a halt .
The Iranian president has spent much of his time in the US insisting his reputation is ill deserved .
"" Iran will not attack any country , "" Mr Ahmadinejad told AP , saying his nation had "" never sought to expand its territory "" , he said .
Yesterday , he told the CBS show 60 Minutes that it was "" wrong to think that Iran and the US are walking towards war "" , also denying vehemently that Iran was trying to develop a nuclear weapon .
The Iranian president , who has called for Israel to be wiped off the map , caused a diplomatic ruckus even before setting foot on US soil when he requested permission to lay a wreath at the World Trade Centre site to commemorate the September 11 attacks .
The New York police last week denied him permission after a public outcry .
Today , the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , said it would have been a travesty for Mr Ahmadinejad to visit the site , known as Ground Zero , even though Iran had nothing to do with the attacks .
"" This is somebody who is the president of a country that is probably the greatest sponsor - state sponsor - of terrorism , "" Ms Rice told the cable TV channel CNBC in an interview .
Earlier , the Iranian president met the leaders of an anti - Zionist Jewish group .
Mr Ahmadinejad , who last year upbraided the US in his speech to the general assembly , met the leaders of a the Neturei Karta International movement , which describes itself as an Orthodox Jewish group opposed to the existence of the state of Israel .
Although he has emerged as American 's biggest bogeyman , he went on a charm offensive yesterday , telling the CBS programme 60 Minutes that Iran did not need nuclear weapons and that his country was not heading for war with the US .
Asked whether Iran and the US were on a collision course over Tehran 's nuclear ambitions , he said : "" It 's wrong to think that Iran and the US are walking toward war .
Who says so ?
Why should we go to war ?
There is no war in the offing . """
2007-09-24,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , said yesterday there was "" no war in the offing "" between his country and the United States .
He told the CBS programme 60 Minutes : "" It 's wrong to think that Iran and the US are walking toward war .
Who says so ?
Why should we go to war ?
There is no war in the offing . ""
At the beginning of a week in which and he and George Bush will deliver competing speeches to the UN in the battle for international support , he repeated a longstanding denial of accusations that Iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon , asking : "" What need do we have for a bomb ? ""
After weeks of increasing speculation about the possibility of war between Iran and the US , both sides seemed anxious to calm nerves .
The head of the US central command , Admiral William Fallon , told al - Jazeera television : "" This constant drumbeat of conflict strikes me as not helpful and not useful . ""
Speeches from Presidents Bush and Ahmadinejad to the UN security council tomorrow will be scrutinised for any sign of compromise on Iran 's nuclear programme , and the "" proxy war "" for control of Iraq , which have raised fears of a direct conflict .
President Ahmadinejad is due to present a preview today at a forum at New York 's Columbia University .
The university authorities have refused to cancel the event despite protests over the Iranian leader 's views on the Holocaust and Israel .
Demonstrations threaten to bring the city 's Upper West Side to a halt .
The Bush - Ahmadinejad clash is likely to be the most dramatic moment in a highly charged week at the UN , when some of the most intractable and dangerous problems facing the world will be debated .
Yesterday Tony Blair made his public debut as a Middle East envoy , reporting to his new employers , the Quartet of world powers ( the US , EU , UN and Russia ) and appearing at a press conference , where he insisted there was new hope for Middle East peace . ""
The most important thing is that things are moving again , "" he said .
A regional peace conference the US is to host in November has provided a "" political horizon that puts credibility back into the process "" .
It was also vital to have change on the ground that "" gives hope to people , both Israelis and Palestinians , that life is going to improve "" .
While Mr Blair seeks backing for the peace process from would - be donor countries , today the focus will shift to the issue of global warming .
More than 70 world leaders will meet to attempt to build momentum for a replacement agreement to the Kyoto accord .
However , the meeting will not include George Bush , Gordon Brown or several other leaders of the big world economies and is only likely to conclude with a vague communique .
Its significance will be the pressure it puts on the US to stay within the UN framework in tackling global warming .
The US will host its own meeting of leading economic powers to discuss the issue in Washington at the end of the week , when Mr Bush will push for a much looser agreement on limiting greenhouse emissions than the deal being pursued by Europe .
His plan would allow countries to observe their own targets .
On Saturday , the UN secretary general , Ban Ki - Moon , agreed to increase the UN 's role in Iraq with the expansion of its Baghdad office , reopening of an office in Basra , and opening of one in Irbil , Kurdistan .
Yesterday it was Afghanistan 's turn , as Hamid Karzai met UN member states to appeal for more support for his embattled government in the face of a resurgent Taliban in the south .
At the end of the week , officials from Serbia and Kosovo will hold talks at the fringes of the general assembly meeting .
It will be the highest - level encounter between the two sides since the 1999 war , and the first direct meeting in this year 's negotiations over Kosovo 's future status .
Kosovo is threatening to secede if its independence is not agreed by December 10 , the UN deadline for the current round of talks to end .
Russia supports Serbia 's effort to block independence and argues that December 10 should not mark the end of diplomacy .
A senior Russian diplomat said Moscow still believed a compromise could be reached .
"" Both parties are only at the beginning of an interesting process of bridging their first asking positions . ""
The week ahead Today Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the president of Iran attends a forum at Columbia University in New York , amid heated controversy over his appearance The biggest - ever meeting of world leaders on climate change is held , intended to be a statement of collective determination to deal with the problem under the auspices of the UN Tuesday George Bush and Mr Ahmadinejad address the UN general assembly .
Friday David Miliband , the foreign secretary , addresses the UN First direct meeting for many years between senior Serbian and Kosovan officials over the Kosovo 's future Meeting between the UK , France , Germany , US , Russia and China on Iran 's nuclear programme ."
2007-09-24,"One of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's favourite tactics is to answer a question with a question .
It thrusts the responsibility for whatever danger is being canvassed back on to his interlocutor and the nation he represents .
When Ahmadinejad asks a US interviewer : "" What need do we have for a bomb ? ""
the message is that such a need could only arise if Iran was faced by the irrational enmity of a heavily armed super - power like , for example , the US .
Or by that of an Israel , which , he pledged yesterday , Iran would never attack .
The Iranian president has gone to New York determined to show that if there is any warmongering going on , it will be seen to be American , not Iranian .
When he and Bush both speak before the UN general assembly today , it will be a competition in who is not to blame for any drift towards war .
There is "" no war in the offing "" says Ahmadinejad which , decoded , means : "" We 're not going to start one .
But who knows what the US is thinking ?
"" It is a fair point .
He has done a pretty good job of rhetorical pre - emption already .
His US hosts look churlish for refusing his request to visit Ground Zero , forgetting the sympathy which distinguished the Iranian response to 9/11 .
The University of Columbia 's president , defending the decision to invite him to speak , said it was worth asking such leaders in order "" to see whether they 're fanatical , to see whether they are sly "" .
That mean - spirited sentence is an indication of how even in a US angry and rueful about Iraq , it is still difficult to suggest that Iran has arguments and interests worth considering on their merits .
Instead , recent public discussion of the Middle East in the US seesaws between blaming Britain , yesterday 's favourite , for abandoning Basra , and praising France , the new prodigal , for its hard line on Iran .
Ahmadinejad does his sabre - rattling at home , where it plays well to his supporters and even better to Arabs in the region , so his sweetness and light turn in New York has to be seen in context .
President Bush does his sabre - rattling at home , too .
His problem is that , at the UN , he is both at home and abroad .
His speech writers will be agonising over the right balance between reasonableness and toughness .
The escalating rhetoric of the last few months in both countries has similar causes .
Displacement is the key .
Bush has obvious reasons to try to draw public attention away from Iraq and shift the blame for disaster in the Middle East on to Iran .
Ahmadinejad 's equivalent disaster is internal .
His inept domestic policies have led to discontent and even the occasional riot .
In trying to regain popularity and keep the support of the real power in Iranian politics , the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , how useful to be able to shake his fist at the US , or to disarm US critics with a display of wit and quick thinking .
The hostility between the US and Iran has deeper causes than the political needs of two men at a particular moment .
A US striving to repair its loss of authority in the Middle East and an Iran with large , although probably unrealistic , ambitions in the area are on dangerously converging trajectories , even before the anxieties of Israel , and the fears of the major Sunni states , are considered .
And , as Iran comes closer to being able to develop nuclear weapons , the dangers of proliferation in a region which now has only one nuclear power but could end up with five or six are genuinely grave .
What New York should be about is creating a structure to control that hostility , such as the multiple contacts , agreements , and hotlines which kept the US and Russia from going to war until the time came when there was no longer any danger of them doing so .
Iran and the US seemed to have made a start at this with the meetings in Baghdad this summer .
That is the track they should both be scrambling to get back on to now .

2007-09-24,"During his visit to New York this week to address the UN General Assembly , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is scheduled to go to Columbia University to address faculty members and also to meet with a group of American religious leaders .
His arrival was preceded by weeks of commotion and dispute : should Ahmadinejad have been allowed to visit ground zero ?
Should Columbia have agreed to host him ?
Should he even have been granted a visa to enter at all ?
In a spasm of infantilism , Republican presidential hopefuls and the right - wing punditocracy have seized the occasion to demonstrate their toughness , decrying the Iranian leader 's mere presence on US soil .
This cacophony , as cacophony so often does , produces confusion .
In the face of this reactionary onslaught , a natural response of many on the left is to say , wait a minute - why should n't Ahmadinejad have been allowed to visit ground zero ?
Why should n't Columbia host him - are n't universities supposed to foster discussion , and why assume the encounter will be uncritical ?
( Indeed Columbia 's president , Lee Bollinger , has stated publicly that he intends to put several tough questions to the Iranian head of state . )
Are n't American religious leaders promoting cross - cultural understanding by engaging in interfaith dialogue with the president of the Islamic Republic ?
Watching Sunday evening 's 60 Minutes interview with Ahmadinejad only highlighted the problem : not unlike a Pravda reporter , correspondent Scott Pelley brazenly assumed the role of a Bush administration mouthpiece , indeed at one point even acting as courier , conveying a toughly - worded message directly from the US president to his Iranian counterpart .
At the interview 's embarrassing low point , Pelley asked Ahmadinejad if there was anything he admired about Bush , and responded with indignant incredulity when his guest failed to produce the desired answer .
The combination of unabashed American nationalism and know - nothing belligerence was almost enough to make one sympathize with Ahmadinejad , at least situationally .
And a lot of progressives did , as was evident from listserv exchanges and online discussions following the broadcast .
There 's something very wrong with this picture .
To untie this knot , it might be helpful to consider an episode from 30 years ago .
In June of 1977 , the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev made an official visit to Paris , where he was received "" with all the ceremony France reserves for her official guests , "" in the words of one historian .
A group of French intellectuals , however - Michel Foucault and Jean - Paul Sartre among them - decided to hold an alternative or shadow reception .
They invited Soviet dissidents living in Paris to gather at the same time that Brezhnev was being feted in the corridors of state power .
"" We simply thought , "" as Foucault put it , "" that , on the evening when M Brezhnev is being received with pomp by [ French president ] M Giscard d'Estang , other French people could receive certain other Russians who are their friends . ""
Those words have as much resonance today as they did when Foucault spoke them three decades ago .
As the headlines and the hubbub this week swirl around Ahmadinejad , maybe we on the left should reach out to certain other Iranians who are our friends .
Maybe our attention and sympathies should belong to the likes of Mansour Osanlou and Mahmoud Salehi , the trade union leaders currently languishing behind bars in Iran for their organizing ; to Emaddedin Baghi , the prisoners ' rights and anti - death penalty activist ; to the Iranians involved with the Million Signatures Campaign , a courageous grassroots movement for women 's rights ; to the many student activists , writers , and intellectuals currently in prison for expressing the wrong views .
While Ahmadinejad occupies center stage , we would be well served to consider another Iranian , the dissident and former political prisoner Akbar Ganji , who has just issued an Open Letter to the UN secretary general that refuses what Slavoj Zizek calls the "" double blackmail "" : Ganji describes the human rights crisis currently gripping Iran -- the severe crackdown on dissent , the crushing of progressive voices ; while at the same time he denounces the Bush administration 's saber rattling and underscores that Iran 's democratic struggle wants no financial assistance from the US ( or any foreign government ) , and is in fact put in grave jeopardy by such maneuvers .
The letter is signed by some of the preeminent intellectuals and writers in the world ( Jürgen Habermas , Orhan Pamuk , Noam Chomsky , JM Coetzee and , appropriately enough , Zizek ) .
It 's dangerously easy to become distracted by the circus surrounding Ahmadinejad 's visit , a disfigured drama in which rightwing political figures and their stenographers in the media feverishly attempt to whip up jingoistic feelings .
That rightwing assault can run an interference pattern on our thinking , where we react by protesting Ahmadinejad 's shabby treatment at the hands of a bellicose political and media establishment .
And - make no mistake about it - bellicose it most certainly is .
But let 's not allow the right - wing warmongers to do our thinking for us .
What if we looked at Ahmadinejad not through the ( inverted ) prism of the American media , but through that of Iranian dissidents , trade unionists and women 's rights activists ?
If we did that , we might discover how certain other Iranians ( including religious ones ) feel about the meetings between American religious leaders and Ahmadinejad .
( Their meeting this week follows one in New York last year , and another one in Tehran earlier this year .
Some of those American religious leaders have had admiring things to say about the Iranian leader . )
"" Given the current situation we 're facing , "" Ganji says , "" these meetings with Ahmadinejad do not help to promote democracy or human rights in Iran but rather contribute to the further subjugation and oppression of the Iranian people ...
Back in Iran , "" he continues , "" the regime will exploit these meetings to enhance its legitimacy by claiming that Ahmadinejad was warmly received by American religious groups .
These meeting are counterproductive and make our struggle more difficult . ""
Upon leaving New York , Ahmadinejad will go to Venezuela to meet with Hugo Chávez , who last year honored the Iranian president with the Collar of the Order of the Liberator ( the country 's highest distinction bestowed on foreign dignitaries ) .
Chávez 's strong affection for Ahmadinejad has been a major contributor to the widespread confusion among many of the Venezuelan leader 's leftist admirers around the world .
And it has infuriated many in Iran 's democratic struggle .
Echoing Ganji , a group of Iranian leftists issued a statement lamenting that the Chávez - Ahmadinejad love fest would "" weaken the mass movements in Iran . ""
"" To us , "" they wrote , "" it is possible for the Venezuelan government to have close diplomatic and trade relations with the Iranian government without giving it political support - particularly where domestic policy is concerned . ""
As Chávez receives Ahmadinejad in Caracas and the two leaders deepen their ties , let 's receive ( or at least think and learn about ) certain other Iranians : the trade unionists and student activists imprisoned by Ahmadinejad 's government , the women 's rights campaigners whose demonstrations are crushed by the Islamic Republic 's security forces , and the human rights activists and democratic dissidents who are endeavoring , in the face of grave danger , to bring about a more free and just Iran .
These other Iranians are a lot less likely to be in the headlines .
But their struggle is ours .
Or should be ."

2007-09-25,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's president , told Americans yesterday his country had no nuclear weapons programme , but then called his own credibility into question by insisting it had no gay people either .
The claim came in the midst of a bad - tempered occasion at Columbia University , where the Iranian leader had been invited to speak but was denounced before he began as a "" petty and cruel dictator "" by the university president .
In the course of a damning introduction , the president of Columbia University , Lee Bollinger , who had been criticised for inviting Mr Ahmadinejad told him he must be "" brazenly provocative or astonishingly uneducated "" to persist in questioning the facts of the Holocaust .
In response , Mr Ahmadinejad criticised Mr Bollinger for insulting him and "" insulting the intelligence of the audience "" by attempting to "" inoculate "" them against the Iranian leader 's views .
With demonstrators jeering outside the university buildings , he went on to repeat his calls for more research into the Holocaust , and delivered a soliloquy on the nature of knowledge and academic enquiry .
He repeated Iran 's longstanding insistence on its right to develop a nuclear energy programme , and its denial of any aspirations to build a nuclear bomb .
The issue will once more be the focus of international diplomacy today , as George Bush and Mr Ahmadinejad deliver speeches to the UN at a time of heightened speculation over the possibility of war .
It was during a short period for questions at the end of Mr Ahmadinejad 's university appearance yesterday that he was challenged over the persecution of gay people . ""
In Iran , we do n't have homosexuals .
In Iran we do n't have this phenomenon .
I do n't know who has told you we have it , "" Mr Ahmadinejad said to laughter and cries of disbelief from the audience of students and university staff .
Homosexuality is illegal in Iran , and sodomy punishable by death .
In one case , two teenage gay boys were executed in 2005 .
The Iranian authorities accused one of them of rape , but the claim was denounced as a smokescreen for persecution by human rights activists .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's outlandish claim echoed a policy of denial towards homosexuality by some Iranian clerics and political leaders , but it is likely to have undermined his public relations campaign in the US , aimed at easing pressure on Iran over its nuclear programme .
In an earlier teleconference with journalists in Washington , the Iranian president claimed to be unworried about the prospect of a US or Israeli air strike on his country . ""
Talk of war is basically a propaganda tool .
People who talk about it have to bring a legal reason , "" Mr Ahmadinejad said .
"" Officials who talk about it should be pressured about what to say and what not to say .
They should not endanger world security . ""
He told journalists any country wanting to go to war against Iran would need a good legal reason to do so and such an excuse did not exist .
Iran had not broken any international agreements by developing nuclear power , he said .
He added that the US should have learned the lesson of past mistakes , alluding to the invasion of Iraq and perhaps to the fiasco of the US attempt to rescue the Tehran hostages in 1980 .
Asked about US claims at the weekend that Iran is smuggling surface - to - air missiles into Iraq for use against American forces , Mr Ahmadinejad denied it , adding that even if it were true , a few weapons would not make much difference to the US , which was already defeated in Iraq .
Even before yesterday 's exchanges , Mr Ahmadinejad faced a hostile reception for his charm offensive .
The New York Daily News declared : The Evil has Landed , and the New York Post called him the Madman Iran Prez . · This article was amended on Thursday September 27 2007 .
Lee Bollinger is president of Columbia University , not the university dean .
This has been corrected ."
2007-09-25,"When Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's ever - combative president , provoked his latest controversy in New York this week by asserting that there were no homosexuals in his country , he may have been indulging in sophistry or just plain wishful thinking .
While Mr Ahmadinejad may want to believe that his ideal of an Islamic society is exclusively non - gay , it is undermined by the paradox that transsexuality and sex changes are tolerated and encouraged under Iran 's theocratic system .
Iran has between 15,000 and 20,000 transsexuals , according to official statistics , although unofficial estimates put the figure at up to 150,000 .
Iran carries out more gender change operations than any other country in the world besides Thailand .
Sex changes have been legal since the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , spiritual leader of the 1979 Islamic revolution passed a fatwa authorising them nearly 25 years ago .
While homosexuality is considered a sin , transsexuality is categorised as an illness subject to cure .
The government seeks to keep its approval quiet in line with its strait - laced stance on sexuality , but state support has actually increased since Mr Ahmadinejad took office in 2005 .
His government has begun providing grants of £ 2,250 for operations and further funding for hormone therapy .
It is also proposing loans of up to £ 2,750 to allow those undergoing surgery to start their own businesses .
Maryam Khatoon Molkara , leader of the country 's main transsexual organisation , said some of those undergoing operations were gay rather than out - and - out transsexuals .
"" In Iran , transsexuals are part of the homosexual family .
Is it possible that a phenomenon exists in the world but not in Iran?""she told the Guardian . ""
Transsexuality is a real disaster .
It 's a one - way street .
But if somebody wants to study , have a future and live like others they should go through this surgery . ""
In New York on Tuesday , Mr Ahmadinejad claimed that homosexuality and lesbianism did not exist in Iran . ""
In Iran we do n't have homosexuals like in your country , "" he told a questioner who accused his government of executing gay men . ""
In Iran we do not have this phenomenon , I do n't know who has told you that we have it . ""
But Ms Molkara - who persuaded Khomeini to issue the fatwa on transsexuality - said his stance was inconsistent with the state 's sex change policy .
"" They are saying homosexuality does n't exits , but they have never given me a chance to use my influence among transsexuals to prevent transsexuality from happening , "" she said .
The president 's claim was also an eye - opener to seasoned Iranian human rights lawyers , who pointed out today that the country 's Islamic legal code made full - and draconian - provision for homosexual offences by both men and women .
It also outraged international gay rights activists , who recalled numerous executions under Iran 's sodomy laws .
When Iranian legal officials announced the execution of 12 prisoners at Tehran 's Evin prison in July , they said the condemned included several "" sodomites "" .
According to campaigners , several gay men have been caught up in a wave of hangings carried out over the summer under a ruthless public order crackdown , although the claims are hard to verify .
There have been other high - profile cases in recent years , including that of two teenagers , Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni , who were publicly hanged in the north - eastern city of Mashhad in the summer of 2005 after admitting having sex .
This summer , Pegah Emambakhsh , an Iranian lesbian , was granted permission to take her case to the court of appeal in Britain after claiming she would be in danger of execution if the home office implemented its ruling to deport her to Iran .
"" Homosexuality is defined both for men and women in law .
There is a section devoted to homosexuality , "" Shirin Ebadi , the Nobel peace prize - winning human rights lawyer , said .
"" There is one part for homosexuality in men , which is called lavat ( sodomy ) , which is punishable by death .
There is another for women , which is called mosahegheh .
If the crime is committed up to three times , the penalty is 100 lashes .
On the fourth , it is execution . ""
Mohammad Mostafai , an experienced advocate , said : "" The fact that there is a penalty for lavat and mosahegheh in our criminal law means they exist .
But if such crimes happen , they are dealt with by guidance courts .
These are very closed and acting in them as lawyers is difficult . ""
It means the defendants hardly have any access to lawyers .
Most such crimes happen inside prison and in single - gender places .
As [ homosexuality ] is a crime which happens in secret , it is hard to estimate how many there are , especially among women . ""
Under Iranian law , only sexual relations occurring inside heterosexual marriages are permissible .
Sodomy is proved if a man confesses four times or through the testimony of four "" righteous "" men .
The severe penalties have driven Iran 's gay community - such as it is - deep underground .
There is no gay scene , although there are areas in Tehran where homosexuals are believed to congregate and meet ."
2007-09-25,"When you see one person and nation being demonised , you have to assume that it is for a purpose .
It is time for some perspective : why should we take it for granted that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is the supreme evil being and a super - klutz at the same time ?
The ungracious introduction to Ahmadinejad 's talk by Lee Bollinger , the Columbia University president , read more like a plea to Fox News and the ADL to give him a break for not calling off the event .
Think of all the people who took umbrage at President Bush 's intellect and morals being belittled last year .
Did Bollinger not realize that he was doing Hugo Chávez imitations ?
As the born - again atheist author of Rum , and a not infrequent imbiber , I am no great fan of Ahmadinejad .
But he was elected by a much clearer majority , with a much bigger turnout , than his equally religious , teetotalling colleague President Bush .
And for those impressed by that sort of thing , the Iranian president volunteered for the front in the war against Saddam Hussein - in contrast to Bush , who dodged the draft , and most of the present White House team , who were then enthusiastic backers of Saddam .
Iran has not invaded any other country since the Islamic revolution .
The Shah , who had his own nuclear programme , was a close friend and strategic ally not only of the US but of Israel , and apartheid South Africa .
But we forgave him his part in maintaining apartheid , just as we forgave ourselves , and indeed Israel , for arming , financing and supporting a pernicious , evil and racist regime .
So , of what is Ahmadinejad guilty ?
He supports the death penalty ?
Anyone would think he was a Texas governor .
Is the president of China ostracized for threatening to rain missiles on Taiwan , for not having elections , or for executing thousands of people a year ?
No , we give him the Olympics , and all the TV channels will be there .
The Iranian president does seem very obtuse about gays , denying that Iran had any .
But homosexual acts still carry a 15-year prison sentence in many Caribbean islands that the more innocent cruise to so insouciantly .
And only a few decades ago the US , UK and other European countries had similar penalties .
Ahmadinejad has been totally insensitive about the Holocaust , though at last in his speech , he certainly seemed to accept that it happened .
But then he asked the very legitimate question of why the Palestinians should have to pay the price for European anti - semitism .
It is a question that no one has , or can , answer satisfactorily without invoking divine sanctions .
Then there is the famous mistranslation of Israel being wiped off the map .
It has been quoted so often now that it has attained , dare we say , myth - like proportions .
But he did not say that .
The original Farsi , as several more inquisitive researchers have demonstrated , did not have that apocalyptic flavouring .
It meant that he would like Israel , as a state , to go away .
Not genocide .
Not massacring the population .
Not even putting them on boats .
At Columbia he seemed to be advocating a one state solution - which more and more Palestinians and even some Israelis are returning to in the face of Israel 's continuing avoidance of a genuine , occupation - free two state solution .
Certainly Ahmadinejad has blood on his hands - mostly Iranian .
But when Ariel Sharon came to town with the stench of sun - bloated cadavers from Sabra and Shatila lingering over him , many of the people demonstrating against Ahmadinejad had probably attended rubber chicken fundraisers with him .
And on both the death penalty and women : Saudi Arabia has the death penalty while Saudi women can neither drive nor vote .
In fact Saudi men ca n't vote in any meaningful way either .
Anti - semitism ?
Iran has 20,000 Jews who refuse to leave .
Not many Jews can get into Saudi Arabia .
But who says no to Saudi princes , oil or money , unless they support Palestinians ?
And then we come to the nuclear issue .
The IAEA Council , under ferocious American pressure , which included giving India a free pass on its overt nuclear weapons , in effect broke its own charter by saying that Iran could not refine its own uranium .
And then it went to the security council to repeat the process .
The Ayatollahs say the bomb is un - Islamic .
I would love the National Evangelical Association to declare it to be un - Christian , or the chief rabbis of Israel to declare it un - Talmudic , but then the US and Israel are nuclear states .
Iran is a member of the non - proliferation treaty and allows inspections , and the IAEA thinks that its nuclear programme is under control .
It is mystifying why the Iranians are courting disaster even if they are technically correct about their legal position .
The nuclear issue only makes sense as brinkmanship , trying to get the US to talk .
It is very dangerous and naïve , and perhaps underestimates the craziness of the people they are dealing with .
Nixon used being mad as a tactic .
Bush has made it a lifestyle option in international politics .
When we suddenly find Muhamed El - Baradei , the IAEA head , becoming an honorary acolyte of the axis of evil for Washington , it is déjà vu all over again .
Some people want war with Iran , very , very badly .
As much as they wanted it with Saddam Hussein .
Chavez is a thuggish populist , who was elected .
Ahmadinehjad , a naïve , fundamentalist one , was also elected .
I would not have voted for either of them .
But I would not vote for war on them and their peoples either - not unless I wanted to consolidate their support and power ."
2007-09-26,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad yesterday declared debate over Iran 's nuclear programme "" closed "" - signalling continued defiance of UN resolutions calling for the programme 's suspension .
In the Iranian president 's address to the UN general assembly , he said that Iran viewed its nuclear industry as an "" ordinary "" technical matter for the oversight of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
Mr Ahmadinejad shrugged off UN resolutions calling for a halt to uranium enrichment , arguing that the security council had been hijacked by major powers to pursue their own interests . ""
In the last two years , abusing the security council , the arrogant powers have repeatedly accused Iran and even made military threats and imposed illegal sanctions against it , "" the Iranian leader said .
He praised the IAEA , with which Iran agreed last month to answer unresolved questions about its past nuclear activities .
He said that attempts to politicise the issue had failed in the face of Iranian resistance , adding : "" I officially announce that in our opinion the nuclear issue of Iran is now closed and has turned into an ordinary agency matter . ""
A meeting of the security council 's permanent five members and Germany is due on Friday to debate the possibility of a third wave of sanctions on Iran as punishment for its defiance over enrichment .
However , Russia and China are expected to resist a new sanctions resolution while Iran is cooperating with the IAEA .
In his general assembly address , George Bush hardly mentioned Iran , only listing it as a "" brutal regime "" alongside Belarus , Syria and North Korea .
Instead it was the French president , Niçolas Sarkozy and the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , who singled Iran out for criticism .
President Sarkozy said that allowing Iran to arm itself with nuclear weapons would be an "" unacceptable risk to stability in the region and in the world "" .
"" There will not be peace in the world if the international community falters in the face of the proliferation of nuclear arms , "" he said ."

On the fourth , it is execution . """
2007-09-26,"Like the crowds gathered outside Columbia University , my first reaction was to laugh out loud .
Iran 's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , lecturing students in New York ahead of his UN speech , was characteristically blunt .
"" In Iran , we do n't have homosexuals .
In Iran we do n't have this phenomenon .
"" Put to one side for a minute the centuries - old tradition of homo - erotic poetry , the bisexuality of successive Iranian kings and the disco scene that was beginning to flourish just as the 1979 revolution put a stop to all partying .
If Ahmadinejad claims that there are no gay people in Iran , well , he 's either stupid or a liar .
He must know gay men and women exist , because he supports the laws used to persecute them .
In July 2005 , while Ahmadinejad 's predecessor , Mohammad Khatami , was still in power , images of the execution of two apparently gay teenagers were seen around the world .
In November that year , less than six months into Ahmadinejad 's presidency , it happened again .
Mokhtar and Ali , two men in their mid-20s known only by their first names , were executed in the northern town of Gorgan for lavat - sex between men .
These extraordinary punishments , though rare , affect the lives of all gay Iranians , raising the terrifying possibility that one day they will be made an example of .
Human nature being what it is , though , this does n't stop them living their lives , having sex and falling in love .
I 'm quite happy to argue the point with the president .
I 'm only half - Iranian
and I was born in Britain , so my own homosexuality could of course be put down to the taint of western genes .
But when I was in Tehran earlier this year , gay men certainly were in evidence .
One day , early for an appointment , I was ambling round one of the city 's many parks .
A guy sat down on the bench opposite , pretending to read the paper .
In fact , he was making rather obvious eyes at me .
After a few moments , he came over and reeled out his line : "" Do n't I know you from somewhere ? ""
( It sounds as cheesy in Farsi as it does in English . )
Offering to take me on a tour of Tehran , he made pointed references to Park - e Laleh , the city 's biggest cruising ground .
I made my excuses and hurried on to my meeting .
Now , was I cruised , or was it a figment of my imagination , Mr Ahmadinejad ?"
2007-09-26,"I am no fan of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's hardline politics which are playing straight into the hands - or more accurately the talons - of Washington hawks .
But I felt a certain twinge of sympathy for the Iranian president , and more so for the Iranian people , at his sorry bungling of his US charm offensive .
His ineptitude was almost as painful to watch as the deafening beating of war drums by the well - oiled US corporate media machine .
Decked out in his shabby and ill - fitting suit , Ahmadinejad cut less the figure of an international statesman and more one of what we call in Egypt the "" muwazaf "" : the downtrodden , underpaid civil servant , dishevelled from too much exposure to grinding poverty and tin - pot public transport , plodding home with a newspaper under one arm and a watermelon under the other .
The expression of constant dread and disorientation on his face gave the impression that some low - level functionary had been teleported to the Big Apple from his dusty cubby - hole in a Tehran ministry to speak on behalf of Iran .
And his troubles did not stop with his wardrobe .
Of course , even Alastair Campbell would 've had his work cut out spin - doctoring Ahmadinejad 's image amid the frenzied and cynical anti - Iranian "" harm "" offensive that has already conquered large swathes of America .
Nevertheless , we have to ask : does the Iranian regime have any international media and political advisers ?
If it does , were these consultants napping when Ahmadinejad accepted the invitation to Columbia University ?
It is common practice , especially in America , for politicians to prearrange the minutest details of their appearances before accepting invitations , including how they will be introduced , vetting the questions they will be asked , how much talktime they will receive , and so on .
I doubt Ahmadinejad had much foreknowledge of the tirade of abuse with which Columbia University 's president Lee Bollinger introduced him , saying the elected Iranian president exhibited "" all the signs of a petty and cruel dictator "" , among other things .
A stunned Ahmadinejad was only able to respond that he found the comments an "" insult "" .
A German friend wondered what the reaction would 've been if US president George Bush were invited to , say , a German university and then introduced as "" a war criminal and mass murder "" by his hosts .
Even the conservative Jerusalem Post was moved to observe that : "" The media had reported that this was a ' speech ' or ' debate ' , but after Lee Bollinger 's introduction , it became a trial . ""
No matter what Bollinger 's personal feelings are on Ahmadinejad 's ridiculous , insulting and ambiguous stance on the Holocaust and the Iranian regime 's human rights record , he broke both the basic rules of decorum and free debate in a disgraceful fashion .
A moderator introducing a debate should , as his function suggests , project a semblance of impartiality and give the speakers a chance to express their views , leaving the audience to decide for themselves .
Of course , there are issues that even top media consultants , if Iran had them , would not be able to put a positive spin on , such as Ahmadinejad 's farcical remark that Iran does not have homosexuals .
But then the current Iranian president is not famed for his grip on reality , such as his suggestion to a group of journalists , when discussing the racially offensive film 300 , that Iran had never invaded any country in its history .
His "" firm no "" to questions on CBS 's 60 Minutes programme regarding Iran 's suspected ambitions to build a nuclear bomb and his more articulate explanation of his motivation for wanting to visit Ground Zero were a slightly better performance , but one can not help but miss his predecessor , the reformist Mohammad Khatami , both for his more enlightened politics and his milder manner .
Elaine Sciolino , author of Persian Mirrors , was also bowled over by his dress sense and his immaculate shoes .
In Iran , he has been described as the "" man with the chocolate robe "" .
But those heady and hopeful days of striking a dialogue among civilisations and modernising Iran seem to be giving way to those who foresee an all too unnecessary clash of civilisations in Washington and Tehran .
Sadly , it would seem that Ahmadinejad 's inept attempt to charm his country out of harm 's way has backfired spectacularly and , if anything , the prospect of a reckless and destructive American attack on Iran seems ever more imminent ."
2007-09-27,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad heads to South America today in an attempt to cement relations with left - wing leaders opposed to the United States .
The Iranian president is flying from New York where on Tuesday he addressed the UN general assembly , criticising "" arrogant "" powers and defying international calls to suspend Tehran 's nuclear programme .
Mr Ahmadinejad is hoping to circumvent US and European attempts to isolate Iran by strengthening links with the Venezuelan president , Hugo Chavez , and his allies .
First on his itinerary is Bolivia , South America 's poorest country , where Mr Ahmadinejad is expected to sign an accord with President Evo Morales on the exploitation of the country 's gas reserves , the continent 's second largest .
Iran and Bolivia do not currently have diplomatic relations but Mr Morales , who considers Mr Chavez his mentor , heads a so - called "" revolutionary "" government which has hardened its attitude to the US .
Mr Ahmadinejad will later travel to Venezuela .
Alberto Garrido , a Venezuelan political analyst , said the links between Mr Ahmadinejad and Mr Chavez were becoming inexorably closer .
"" It 's Iran 's answer to the United States on its own home turf .
The United States is in the Middle East , so Iran is in Latin America , "" he said .
Connie Mack , a US Republican , said the relationship between Tehran and Caracas was similar to the old Cuba - Soviet Union axis . ""
Ahmadinejad recognises that if he can get a foothold in Latin America , he can continue to spread his hatred for the United States , "" he said .
Mr Mack said Washington had to engage more with Latin America , which many observers claim has been largely ignored under President George Bush .
Commercial ties between Venezuela and Iran , whose capitals are now linked by a direct air service , are booming .
They have signed more than 180 trade agreements since 2001 , worth more than £ 10 billion in potential investment , according to Iran 's official news agency , IRNA .
Mr Chavez is a vocal defender of Iran 's nuclear programme , which Iran insists is peaceful .
He has accused the US of fabricating concerns about possible nuclear weapons to use as a pretext to attack the country .
"" Iran is n't making an atomic bomb , not at all , "" he said on Monday .
"" They just want to develop nuclear energy .
Venezuela will do it also someday . ""
Bolivia 's vice - president , Alvaro Garcia , has insisted his government does not endorse nuclear proliferation and the two nations simply want to build commercial ties , which are practically non - existent .
Analysts say Iran alone can not give Bolivia the massive investment it needs to boost gas output in the face of potential domestic shortages .
Iran is also developing links with Ecuador and Nicaragua .
Last month Iran 's PressTV reported Tehran would for the first time open an embassy in Quito .
The president of Nicaragua , Daniel Ortega , has accepted promised Iranian funding for agricultural equipment in exchange for shipping coffee , meat and bananas to Iran ."
2007-09-28,"Red carpets , brass bands , bear hugs and a hero 's welcome :
there is at least one part of the Americas that loves Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
South America this week greeted the Iranian president as a brother and benefactor , defrosting him after his icy reception in New York .
The leaders of Bolivia and Venezuela embraced Mr Ahmadinejad and blessed Iran 's nuclear programme , underlining how much influence Washington has lost over a region it once considered its backyard .
The Iranian president signed a series of energy and trade deals during brief stopovers which extended Tehran 's foothold in South America .
In contrast to the insults heaped on him in New York , the visitor was feted as a strategic ally in the struggle against gringo imperialism .
Cuba and Nicaragua echoed the rhetoric .
Mr Ahmadinejad was received late on Thursday by Venezuela 's president , Hugo Chávez , in a pomp - filled ceremony in Caracas .
Mr Chávez , who is using oil revenues to challenge US influence , saluted "" one of the greatest anti - imperialist fighters "" .
He praised Mr Ahmadinejad 's speeches this week at the UN general assembly and at Columbia University , New York , where he faced hostility from students and the university president . ""
An imperial spokesman tried to disrespect you , calling you a cruel little tyrant , "" said Mr Chávez .
"" You responded with the greatness of a revolutionary .
We felt like you were our representative . ""
The Iranian , appearing cheerful and relaxed , responded in kind . ""
Together we are surely growing stronger , and in truth no one can defeat us .
Imperialism has no other option : Respect the peoples [ of the world ] or accept defeat .
"" This was his third visit to Venezuela .
In recent years the countries have launched joint projects worth more than £ 10bn to develop oil and make tractors , cars and bicycles .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's Islamism and questioning of the Holocaust and gay rights have not impeded an alliance which says that if anyone should be in the dock for human rights abuses it is the US for the Iraq war , Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay .
The west suspects Tehran of plotting to make atomic bombs , but to the Bush administration 's chagrin several Latin American leaders defended the regime 's nuclear programme as a legitimate attempt to make electricity , including Brazil 's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , who has good relations with the US .
Nicaragua 's president , Daniel Ortega , a long - time Washington foe who recently visited Iran , went further in his UN address .
"" Even if they want nuclear power for purposes that are not peaceful , with what right does [ the US ] question it ? ""
Before going to Caracas Mr Ahmadinejad visited La Paz on a Venezuelan government jet to establish diplomatic relations with Bolivia 's leftwing president , Evo Morales .
The two governments agreed to a five - year industrial cooperation plan with a £ 500 m investment as well as a £ 50 m plan to jointly develop technology and trade . ""
The people of Iran and Bolivia have decided to build their countries together , hand in hand , "" said Mr Ahmadinejad .
Without naming the US , Mr Morales said the Andean nation would not be bullied into shunning supposedly rogue states .
"" We will never promote war but nor do we accept that in the name of peace the criteria of the strongest prevails .
"" Some analysts play down Iran 's economic links with Latin American as more rhetoric than substance .
But when US diplomats discuss the issue it is striking how their jaws tend to clench .
A US Republican congressman , Connie Mack , said the links reminded him of Fidel Castro 's relationship with the Soviet Union .
"" You do n't want to have your enemy at your backdoor . """
2007-09-30,"John Bolton , the former US ambassador to the United Nations , told Tory delegates today that efforts by the UK and the EU to negotiate with Iran had failed and that he saw no alternative to a pre - emptive strike on suspected nuclear facilities in the country .
Mr Bolton , who was addressing a fringe meeting organised by Lord ( Michael ) Ancram , said that the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , was "" pushing out "" and "" is not receiving adequate push - back "" from the west .
"" I do n't think the use of military force is an attractive option , but I would tell you I do n't know what the alternative is . ""
Because life is about choices , I think we have to consider the use of military force .
I think we have to look at a limited strike against their nuclear facilities . ""
He added that any strike should be followed by an attempt to remove the "" source of the problem "" , Mr Ahmadinejad .
"" If we were to strike Iran it should be accompanied by an effort at regime change ...
The US once had the capability to engineer the clandestine overthrow of governments .
I wish we could get it back . ""
The fact that intelligence about Iran 's nuclear activity was partial should not be used as an excuse not to act , Mr Bolton insisted .
"" Intelligence can be wrong in more than one direction . ""
He asked how the British government would respond if terrorists exploded a nuclear device at home . ""
' It 's only Manchester ? ' ...
Responding after they 're used is unacceptable . ""
Mr Bolton , now a fellow at the conservative thinktank the American Enterprise Institute and the author of a forthcoming book called Surrender is Not an Option , was applauded by delegates when he described the UN as "" fundamentally irrelevant "" .
Defending the decision to invade Iraq , he mocked the Foreign Office 's "" softly softly "" approach to Iran 's imprisonment of 15 British sailors accused of straying into Iranian waters in April this year .
They were released after Mr Ahmadinejad announced he was making a "" gift "" to the British people .
"" They [ Iran ] got no response from the UK or the US .
If you were the Iranian leader , what conclusion do you draw ? ""
Mr Bolton said he did not really want "" to get into the specifics of your own internal politics here "" and made no comment on David Cameron 's foreign policy .
But he said that Gordon Brown 's performance under pressure had not been tested and he hoped that Britain would not withdraw from Iraq .
"" There is too much of a view in Europe that you have passed beyond history , "" Mr Bolton told delegates .
"" That everything can be worked out by negotiation ... Democrats or Republicans , we [ Americans ] do n't see it that way . ""
However , he praised the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , and his forthright criticism of Iran in recent weeks .
Raising the spectre of George Bush 's "" axis of evil "" , Mr Bolton said that Kim Jong - il 's regime in North Korea was akin to a "" prison camp "" and that he would "" sell anything to anyone "" .
Those who thought North Korea would give up its nuclear capability voluntarily were wrong , he said .
The regime had made similar promises during the past decade .
Only reunification between North and South Korea could resolve the problem .
That could be achieved "" if China were to get serious "" and cut off fuel supplies to Mr Kim , but the country feared a reunited Korea .
Mr Bolton told an inquiring delegate that he was not and had never been a neoconservative : "" I 'm not even a Reagan conservative .
I 'm a [ Barry ] Goldwater conservative .
They [ neocons ] have somewhat - I would say excessively - Wilsonian views about the benefits of democracy . ""
However , the threat to world peace did not come from neoconservatives but from the perception that "" we have passed beyond history "" , he said .
The meeting was organised by the Global Strategy Forum , of which Lord Ancram is chairman .
Earlier this month , the former Conservative deputy leader criticised the direction in which David Cameron was taking the party and for "" trashing "" its Thatcherite heritage ."
2007-10-03,"In my previous article , I was surprised by how much debate a passing remark I made about Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's ill - fitting suit sparked .
Quite a few readers accused me of preferring style over substance .
But that was missing the point entirely .
My comments on his appearance and approach were meant to illustrate how little Ahmadinejad understood and how badly he handled the carefully choreographed , glitzy , black - and - white world of American politics and media .
Besides , being unrepentantly scruffy myself , I am hardly going to be snobbish , as some accused me , about the appearance of others .
As I prefer to judge people by their substance , I have great admiration for plenty of unconventional dressers , such as Mohandas Gandhi .
Iran 's first democratically elected leader , Mohammad Mosaddeq was apparently fond of wearing pink pyjamas and had the eccentric habit of bursting into tears in parliament .
Whereas some posters claimed that Ahmadinejad 's modest attire was a sign of his moral rectitude , I am not so naïve as to read much into a politician 's wardrobe .
To his credit , the Iranian president still lives in the same modest Tehran apartment he occupied when he was the mayor of that city , but his personal thrift does not necessarily mean he has his people 's best interests at heart .
In fact , the only clear message his dress sends out in the Iranian context is that he is not a cleric , unlike most of Iran 's previous post - revolution presidents .
But that does n't make Ahmadinejad any more secular or less of an ideologue .
He is an old guard of the Iranian revolution and , lacking his own popular support base , has been almost entirely dependent on the largesse of the hardline clerics for his political survival .
The amount of admiration expressed for Ahmadinejad by certain posters surprised me somewhat .
A couple even went so far as to accuse me of being a neocon apologist .
Such remarks are symptomatic of a certain worrying trend in the Middle East .
Disillusionment at the region 's internationally pliant but domestically repressive regimes and anger at Anglo - American and Israeli militarism have combined to ensure that leaders seen to be defying the west or Israel , no matter how recklessly or for whatever selfish reasons , are elevated to the level of cult heroes in the eyes of millions - usually outside their own countries .
A reverse process is operating in many parts of the west , particularly the United States , where the same defiant figures are portrayed as irredeemably bad and irreducibly evil , while the unsightly corruption of co - operative ruling elites is airbrushed out .
The current crop of cult heroes are Ahmadinejad , Hizbullah 's Hassan Nasrallah and the late Saddam Hussein , to name the most prominent examples ( a related phenomenon is the Israeli penchant for electing leaders who shoot first and fail to ask questions later , such as Ariel Sharon ) .
But what people who subscribe to this narrative overlook is that , just because the neo - cons are the "" bad guys "" , that does not make their opponents the "" good guys "" .
If Bush and his neocon cronies are guilty of "" manufacturing consent "" , these cult heroes have been culpable of attempting to manage discontent and divert it into dissent beyond their own borders .
Nasrallah 's reckless and unnecessary provocation of an Israel itching for a fight , and the unrestrained Israeli fury it unleashed , was claimed by Hizbullah as a "" divine victory "" .
The disturbing images and descriptions of wholesale destruction my wife brought back shortly after the 2006 war - as well as the cluster submunitions that litter south Lebanon - left me wondering what the Hizb would define as defeat .
Nasrallah may have been feted in the Arab world as a hero , but it was millions of ordinary Lebanese who paid the price for his recklessness and miscalculated gamble , cynically designed to revive Hizbullah 's raison d'etre and waning popularity following the 2000 Israeli pullout from south Lebanon , and resist increasingly vocal calls within Lebanon for the shia'a militia to disarm or become part of the regular army .
Although Hizbullah 's social and charity arm has served Lebanon 's marginalised shia community well and is the de facto government of southern Lebanon , its military wing has done an enormous disservice to Lebanon as a whole - and more and more Lebanese are asking why that was .
On the other side of the border , the decision of Ehud Olmert ( who , like Ahmadinejad , is an unpopular ex - mayor ) to go to war was a cynical attempt to bolster his own slim popularity ratings with a show of military prowess which backfired dramatically against him .
Olmert 's recklessness has also set back prospects of the eventual acceptance of Israel into the Middle Eastern fold and future generations of Israelis will pay for his folly with their insecurity .
It is a testament to how badly the Bush - Blair duo 's invasion of Iraq has turned out that millions of Iraqis now look back on Saddam Hussein 's terrible years with a certain amount of fondness .
In addition , the late Iraqi dictator has a surprisingly large fan club across the Arab world .
But to forgive him his many sins and eulogise his "" faith in Arab unity [ and ] his confrontation of the Arab world 's enemies "" - as Abdel - Bari Atwan did at the time of Hussein 's execution in the London - based newspaper , al - Quds al - Arabi - is turning the tragedy he inflicted on his long - suffering people and the divisions he inflicted on the region into farce .
In the case of Ahmadinejad , rather than take the tough socio - economic reforms required to create jobs for the legions of unemployed young people and provide the two - thirds of the population who are under the age of 30 with the modern , more liberal lifestyle they yearn for , he has been grandstanding on the international stage .
The nuclear powers are certainly hypocritical in their stance towards Iran 's ambitions in this area .
But even if Iran truly intends its nuclear programme only for civilian purposes , the question still remains : why does it need an expensive and wasteful scheme of this sort ?
Would n't the vast resources being pumped into this programme be better spent boosting the country 's creaking oil - refining capacity ?
It is a sad sign of the regime 's warped priorities that this Opec member has had to introduce an oil rationing programme under Ahmadinejad 's watch because it is experiencing a shortage of refined petrol .
If the Iranian government is worried about the consequences of post - oil Iran , would n't it be a lot more sensible and less controversial to invest in solar power , given the abundant supply of sun the country enjoys ?
Concentrated solar power ( the cheap and more low - tech cousin of photovoltaic technology ) not only has the potential to produce all the electricity Iran could ever need , but also has the added advantage that it can desalinate seawater and reclaim desert land to boot .
It seems likely that the regime is engineering an unnecessary crisis to appease the hardliners and silence critics as unpatriotic at a time of national need .
Of course , Ahmadinejad 's gamble is that Washington is too embroiled in Iraq to attack Iran .
But what if this calculated brinkmanship triggers an unexpected chain reaction ?
If America decides to take military action against Iran , it will be the Iranian people who will pay for Ahmadinejad 's and Washington 's folly .
But why are recklessly defiant leaders the subject of such admiration in the Middle East ?
I believe the reason for this is the inflexible structure of the post - colonial order in this strategically important region .
The model that has prevailed since the early 20th century has tolerated repressive client states and punished , marginalised or radicalised moderate leaders who wanted to steer a more independent course .
A classic example is Mosaddeq .
A secular , enlightened and democratically elected leader , he wanted to retain more of Iran 's oil wealth to fuel the country 's development .
When the British refused to raise the royalties Iran received from the Anglo - Iranian Oil Company ( now British Petroleum ) in 1951 , Mossadeq went on to nationalise the Iranian oil industry .
This so infuriated the British that they persuaded the Americans to join them in engineering a coup - Operation Boot to the British and Operation Ajax to the Americans - to depose Mossadeq and reinstate the shah , Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , whose repressive rule paved the way to the 1979 revolution . ""
The coup that ended Iran 's independence in 1953 would provide a bitter lesson to the revolutionaries of 1979 .
If the shah was to be deposed , there would be no flirtation with constitutional rights , no half - measures , no counter - revolutionaries to restore western power in Iran , "" Robert Fisk writes in his monumental tome , The Great War for Civilisation .
At around the same time as Mossadeq , the Free Officers deposed the king and came to power in Egypt in 1952 , probably with an eye cast to the drama playing out in Iran .
The popular and populist Gamal Abdel - Nasser had started off as a great admirer of the west and wanted to build good ties with America which had even given his coup clandestine support .
For his entire term in office , he was suspicious of communism .
However , his attempts to steer a non - aligned and independent policy - along with India and Yugoslavia - angered Britain , France and the United States .
And , in the Cold War rhetoric of the time , if he was n't with the west , he was against it .
The Free Officers ' precarious position , their desire to modernise Egypt , as well as the allure of power , led them to abandon their original plans to introduce democracy in Egypt and step aside for free elections .
And Egypt , the rest of the Middle East , and the wider world is suffering the long - term consequences of short - sighted western interventionism and the radicalisation it sparks ."
2007-10-04,""" Hello Iran . ""
Photographer : David Zalubowski / AP Photo .
Following the debacle of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's visit to Columbia University in the US , an Iranian university has invited George Bush to come and answer questions from its students and teachers .
The invitation from Ferdowsi University , in the holy city of Mashhad , suggests that President Bush might like to answer questions in the same way that President Ahmadinejad did , "" despite all the insults directed at him "" .
Maybe the Iranian press will also match - or perhaps improve on - the New York Daily News headline that greeted Ahmadinejad : ""
The Evil Has Landed "" .
In the unlikely event that Mr Bush a accepts this invitation , what scenario could you envisage ?
Might Bush come up with something to top Ahmadinejad 's claim that Iran has no homosexuals , or might the Iranian people find a special place in their hearts for America 's president ?"
2007-10-04,"The high profile welcome received by Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad during his visit to Bolivia and Venezuela was a conscious rebuff to the foreign policy goals of George Bush and Tony Blair .
This is part of a long - term trend , as Latin America has moved to the left and become increasingly disenchanted with the broad thrust of western policy - making in recent years .
Indeed many of the sentiments expressed by its more radical governments are also shared by those of its moderates and underline the increasing loss of influence that Washington is suffering in what it used to consider as its "" own backyard "" .
Brazil last week pointedly supported Iran 's right to develop nuclear energy and opposed the imposition of sanctions on Burma 's military dictatorship .
While the Iranian president 's visit to Bolivia was intended to signify the opening of diplomatic relations between the two countries , Iran has already established relations with Chile , Mexico , Brazil , Ecuador and Argentina among others .
Brazil 's foreign minister , Celso Amorim , recently visited Iran and , during a joint press conference with President Bush at Camp David , Lula publicly defended Iran as "" an important trade partner "" with whom Brazil has "" no political divergence "" .
Rejecting US calls to shun the Iranian regime , Lula insisted , "" we will continue to work together on what is in our national interest "" .
Lula also defended Iran 's right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful means at the UN general assembly , while some other Latin American leaders went further .
Nicaragua 's president , Daniel Ortega , asked rhetorically : "" Even if they want nuclear power for purposes that are not peaceful , with what right does [ the US ] question it ? ""
Venezuela 's Hugo Chávez and Bolivia 's Evo Morales have both publicly insisted that Iran 's nuclear programme is purely for pacific ends .
Morales rejected claims from his domestic opposition alleging that Bolivia has promised to supply uranium for Iran 's nuclear programme .
The two governments agreed to a cooperation plan to jointly develop technology and trade .
"" We will never promote war but nor do we accept that in the name of peace the criteria of the strongest prevails "" he concluded , emphasising that no one had the right to dictate to Bolivia with which countries it should do business . ""
The people of Iran and Bolivia have decided to build their countries together , hand in hand , "" Ahmadinejad responded .
Part of this new political alignment has economic roots .
Brazil has trebled its export of goods to Iran since Lula took office and its state oil company , Petrobras , has recently opened an office in Tehran .
Iran has showered aid on poorer countries such as Nicaragua and Bolivia and plans to expand its links with the new radical government of Ecuador .
Commercial ties between Venezuela and Iran , whose capitals are now linked by a direct air service , are booming .
They have signed more than 180 trade agreements since 2001 , worth more than £ 10bn in potential investment .
However , such links pale into insignificance compared to Latin America 's economic trade with the US and clearly show that the underlying tensions are political .
The US has a history of interfering in Latin American politics and many of its current generation of political leaders are former political prisoners of US - sponsored military dictatorships .
There has been a strong reaction against the so - called "" Washington Consensus "" of economic policies foisted on them in recent years and resentment against western domination of institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund .
Reform of world trade has been repeatedly blocked by northern protectionism and there is growing frustration at the failure to meaningfully overhaul institutions of global governance such as the UN .
The countries of Latin America overwhelmingly opposed the invasion of Iraq .
Mexico and Chile resisted massive pressure from the US to vote in favour of the invasion on the UN security council .
Only one , El Salvador , has contributed any troops to the occupation force .
Latin America works within the so - called "" G77 "" block of countries which repeatedly clashed with John Bolton when he was the US ambassador to the UN .
Brazil 's foreign policy priorities were reflected in two statements from its foreign office over the last few days .
One consisted of a single sentence referring to the political crisis in Burma which simply called on all sides "" to reach a solution through dialogue "" .
A far more lengthy one dealt , again , with Brazil 's attempts to gain a seat on the UN security council , which is something of a national obsession .
It described security council reform as "" the most important remaining objective adopted by Heads of State and Government "" in the UN millennium summit of two years ago and again called for urgent action to address the issue .
Although human rights in Burma and nuclear proliferation in the Middle East should clearly not be traded against issues such as UN reform and an end to northern protectionism , it is becoming increasingly difficult to deal with each problem in isolation .
The attempts to unilaterally impose a new world order by Bush and Blair proved spectacularly unsuccessful over the last few years .
It is time for their successors to think about a new approach ."
2007-10-11,"Republican congressman Duncan Hunter has finally come up with an effort more quixotic than his fledgling presidential campaign : the Restore Patriotism to University Campuses Act of 2007 , which aims to deny Columbia University every dime in federal funding for research and education in retaliation for the university 's hosting of Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad last month .
Hunter insists that Iran is funding insurgent operations against American forces in Iraq .
Thus , Hunter argued in announcing the bill , Columbia "" openly insulted the thousands of servicemen and women serving in Iraq , most of whom are direct targets of the munitions that he is sending across the Iraq - Iran border . ""
Because the university "" welcomes a sponsor of terrorism "" while simultaneously refusing to allow military recruitment on campus , it should be denied all federal grants for research , which amounted to nearly $ 460 m in 2005 .
These vital monies fund everything from cutting - edge scientific work that may form the basis for pharmaceutical breakthroughs , to national security research that contributes to the defence of the country whose proud traditions of free speech and open debate Hunter so absurdly mocks .
Hunter 's not just lost the plot ; he also does n't seem to have paid attention to what actually went on at Columbia .
University president Lee Bollinger 's introductory denunciation of Ahmadinejad as a "" cruel and petty dictator "" to his face hardly amounts to laying out the welcome mat .
And the reluctance of Columbia and many other universities to receive military recruiters stems not from any lack of pride in the armed forces , but instead a disgust at its offensive policy of denying gays and lesbians the right to serve their country openly .
But it 's the hypocrisy of it all that really perturbs .
On his campaign website , Hunter enumerates the "" freedom of private and home education from federal regulation "" among his "" core principles "" .
Apparently , he also believes that this freedom is an ephemeral one , for if a private educational institution like Columbia does something the government does n't like , Big Brother can deny it vital research dollars .
Making scientific inquiry - the decidedly non - partisan pursuit of knowledge intended to improve the welfare and perspectives of humankind - contingent on the whims of legislators who often put selfish , short - term interests ( like generating buzz for an otherwise dud of a campaign ) above those of the nation is surely the worst idea any candidate has offered thus far in the 2008 presidential cycle .
Imagine what would result if , miraculously , the legislative sea parted and Hunter 's bill passed through : creationists in Congress could seek to cut funding to universities engaged in evolutionary work ; fundamentalists in the Senate would try to bully colleges into mandating that students take courses in conservative theology ; rightwing legislators might make dollars for scholars conditional on universities requiring that their students take courses on the glories of the Bush presidency .
OK , that last one probably wo n't happen , but the possibilities for bureaucratic suppression of free speech in the ( albeit unlikely ) event that the bill becomes law are nevertheless both endless and chilling .
There is no denying that Ahmadinejad 's views on everything from Israel to gay rights are reprehensible and offensive to rational individuals .
The man should not be occupying the presidency of the sixth largest Muslim nation in the world - let alone gracing the lecterns of America 's leading institutions of scholarship .
And one has to question the competence of the Columbia administrators who invited him : how exactly does the hosting of a delusional demagogue who believes we need "" more research "" to determine whether the Holocaust happened and denies that homosexuals exist qualify as furthering intellectual discourse ?
But with his frivolous , pathetic legislation , Hunter is pulling off the impossible : rivalling Ahmadinejad as the biggest political buffoon of 2007 ."
2007-10-17,"Vladimir Putin 's meeting with the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , during which the Russian president warned other countries against the use of force on the Tehran regime , has been interpreted in several different ways today .
The Times reports : "" President Putin forged an alliance with Iran yesterday against any military action by the west and pledged to complete the controversial Iranian nuclear power plant at Bushehr . ""
But the Independent sees it differently , writing that the US "" appears to have successfully leaned on Russia "" , citing Mr Putin 's continued withholding of nuclear fuel from Iran 's sole reactor based on "" legal and financial "" details .
The Telegraph also notes that Mr Putin gave "" modest hope that the project would be completed , but refused to give a date "" .
But , in its leader , it cautions : "" Mr Putin may come to regret the games he is at present glad to play with a serious source of instability on his southern flank . ""
Simon Tisdall , in his world briefing in the Guardian , notes : "" Mr Putin is hardly falling over himself to help Iran become a nuclear weapons state , if that is what Tehran is indeed trying to do . ""
He concludes : "" In short , Russia is playing both sides against the middle , using current tensions with the west to advance its national interest . ""
This is an extract from The Wrap , our digest of the daily papers ."
2007-10-20,"Iran 's nuclear standoff with the West seemed set to hit new levels yesterday after its chief negotiator resigned in a move that strengthened the hand of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the country 's radical President .
Ali Larijani quit as secretary of the supreme national security council after repeated clashes with Ahmadinejad over tactics .
His resignation came as a revolutionary guard commander said it will fire back thousands of rockets on ' enemy ' bases if attacked .
Iran has repeatedly refused to suspend its uranium enrichment programme - suspected by the US and its allies as a front for building an atomic bomb - in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions .
Larijani 's resignation was announced by Ahmadinejad 's spokesman , Gholamhossein Elham , who said Larijani had offered to resign several times in recent months . '
Larijani had resigned repeatedly .
Finally the president accepted his resignation , ' Elham said .
Insiders depicted the development as a victory for Ahmadinejad in a power struggle between his radical supporters and more traditional conservatives for control of the nuclear issue .
They said it reflected increasing support for the president from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader , and a determination on the Islamic regime 's part not to capitulate to UN demands .
Larijani 's resignation was tendered and accepted last week , but its announcement delayed , possibly to avoid overshadowing the visit to Tehran of Vladimir Putin , the Russian president , who last Tuesday became the first Kremlin leader to go to Iran since Stalin in 1943 .
Larijani was said to have offered to quit during a meeting in which Ahmadinejad criticised his ' semi - independent ' negotiating style .
The president told him to put it in writing .
Saeed Jalili , deputy foreign minister for European and American affairs , who is believed to have become increasingly influential on the nuclear issue , will succeed Larijani .
Elham said the new appointment would not affect policy . '
Iran 's nuclear policies are stabilised and unchangeable .
Managerial change wo n't bring any changes in policies , ' he said .
However , the change is seen as signalling an even tougher stance by Iran towards the UN . '
It shows that the confrontation between Iran and the UN will reach an even higher point and the answer to all the demands will be , we will continue on our path and we do n't care what comes out of the security council , ' Issa Saharkhiz , a Tehran - based political commentator , said .
The security council has already passed two mild sets of sanctions against Iran for failing to suspend enrichment .
A decision on a third embargo has been postponed until at least next month .
Russia and China have been dragging their feet over demands from the US , Britain and France for tougher measures .
The Bush administration has refused to rule out military strikes .
After Putin 's visit , Larijani said the Russian leader had offered a proposal for resolving the dispute , but he was contradicted by Ahmadinejad .
Larijani had gained a reputation for being willing to engage with the West , despite not wanting to abandon Iran 's nuclear activities .
However , he said that his negotiating strategy was being undercut by Ahmadinejad 's uncompromising rhetoric ."
2007-10-21,"Doubts surrounded the future of Iran 's foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , yesterday after the departure of the country 's chief nuclear negotiator appeared to signal a significant power shift to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
A day after Ali Larijani resigned as secretary of the supreme national security council , speculation grew that the foreign minister , a career diplomat , may be the next to go as the president tightens his grip on nuclear policy .
Mr Larijani quit after differences with the president over Iran 's negotiating strategy .
Despite being staunchly opposed to abandoning the country 's uranium enrichment programme - which the west suspects is designed to build a nuclear bomb - Mr Larijani favoured diplomatic engagement to relieve international pressure , in contrast to the president 's defiant approach .
Western diplomats in Tehran were adopting a "" wait and see "" approach yesterday to the appointment of Mr Larijani 's successor , Saeed Jalili , 42 , a hawk and close ally of the president .
But analysts said the president , who has declared Iran 's nuclear case "" closed "" , had gained control over the issue and predicted a more inflexible posture in the face of UN security council demands to suspend enrichment .
The foreign minister is believed to have been frozen out of major decision - making , and rumours of his impending departure have circulated for weeks . ""
Mr Mottaki has a diplomatic background , but the president is looking for people with a special military and intelligence background , "" said a political analyst , Issa Saharkhiz .
"" They plan to give a tough , uncompromising reaction to the UN security council sanctions , and for this they want people with less diplomatic backgrounds and who least believe in dialogue with western nations . ""
Mr Larijani played a key role in the release of the 15 British sailors and marines who strayed from Iraq into Iranian territorial waters last spring .
That paved the way for a secret meeting in Europe between him and Tony Blair 's foreign policy adviser , Nigel Sheinwald .
But the Foreign Office played down the significance of the move . ""
At the end of the day I do n't think it 's a question of individuals , "" a spokesman said .
"" The Iranians are quite clear on what the international community expects of them . """
2007-10-21,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , may be gaining support across the Muslim world for his fervent criticism of the United States , but inside Iran he is losing strength .
His political rivals are gaining new positions of power , and Iranians are increasingly unhappy with the economy 's continuing decline .
Since its inception , the Islamic Republic has had a weak presidency ; ultimate authority rests with the supreme leader , first Ayatollah Khomeini and now Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
The Islamic Republic 's first president , Abolhassan Bani - Sadr , was dismissed from office a year after his election .
Ever since , the regime has been intolerant of a strong president , and has repeatedly demonstrated that the office is subservient to the supreme leader .
Ahmadinejad 's election two years ago came with great expectations , with the new president pledging to "" bring oil prices to the dining table of all households in Iran "" , and to crack down on corruption .
Yet many of his first appointments were rewards to his supporters and cronies in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Basij militia , armed groups that mobilised voters on his behalf during the campaign .
For example , the Oil Ministry gave a $ 1.3bn no - bid contract to an oil company associated with the Revolutionary Guards , and Ahmadinejad appointed his brother - in - law as cabinet secretary .
Steps like these might have been overlooked in better economic times .
But the Iranian budget is now running a 15%-of - GDP deficit , and foreign reserves are shrinking , despite the oil boom .
Instead of distributing oil revenues through a programme of low - cost loans , as promised , the government has been forced to ration petrol as economic promise has given way to crisis .
Tensions have also been on the rise since Ahmadinejad fulfilled his campaign promise to enforce Islamic strictures on social life .
For two years , police have waged an intense campaign against women and young people .
Last summer , more than 150,000 women were arrested in Tehran for wearing "" bad veils "" , and barber shops have been given specific instructions on acceptable hairstyles for young men .
Demonstrations by bus drivers , school teachers , women 's rights activists , and students have been brutally suppressed , with dozens of arrests .
Photos and video clips of police beating civilians in Tehran and other cities have been disseminated on the internet .
But now Ahmadinejad 's opponents are moving to reassert longstanding constraints on the presidency .
His foremost rival , Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , a former president who Ahmadinejad defeated to win the post , has had a remarkable reversal of fortune , re - emerging as leader of the Assembly of Experts , the powerful body that elects Iran 's supreme leader and that can even remove a supreme leader from office .
Moreover , conservatives who had aligned themselves with Ahmedinejad are now criticising him openly .
Even Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who as supreme leader is also commander - in - chief of the armed forces , has taken steps to demonstrate his authority , recently firing the leaders of the Revolutionary Guard and the Basij militia .
Among Iran analysts , it is thought that these moves were intended to revitalise the military , particularly given the possibility of conflict with the US .
But experts also note that the former commanders were close to Ahmadinejad and had made a great effort over the last two years to help him implement his agenda .
While Ahmadinejad continues his verbal attacks on the US , he does not control the policy - making apparatus that will decide about Iran 's nuclear programme and its relations with the international community .
The threat of sanctions remains potent , and the Iranian business community - not to mention the public - has felt the sting of isolation .
Considering the tangled involvement of Iran 's leaders in the economy , the effect of sanctions should not be underestimated .
The economy remains the one area of Iranian life where Ahmadinejad retains considerable power .
But here his record is weak and his pronouncements only exacerbate the problem by increasing Iran 's isolation from the global economy .
So , as disputes with the west come to a head , it is important to recognise the power shifts under way inside Iran 's political system .
Ahmadinejad may be making increasingly challenging statements , but he does not have the authority to act on them .
Indeed , only a military confrontation with the US can bring him back to the centre of decision - making .
American policymakers should bear that in mind .

2007-10-22,"Saeed Jalili , who replaced Ali Larijani as Iran 's top nuclear negotiator at the weekend , is a man of strong moral views who believes spiritual values must inform political actions .
His absolute conviction of the rightness of Iran 's cause , and his loyalty to his old friend Iran 's hardline president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , may make him an awkward interlocutor when talks with the EU on the nuclear dossier resume in Rome tomorrow .
In a lengthy interview conducted in Tehran last year , Dr Jalili , then a deputy foreign minister , offered a robust worldview that simultaneously revealed a lack of understanding and experience of the west largely typical of the Ahmadinejad government .
Although his official brief covered Europe and North America , he has spent little or no time there .
Dr Jalili 's views on the nuclear issue reflected this odd mixture of moral certainty and political disingenuousness bordering on naivety .
"" We have announced time and again that we believe in the logic of negotiation .
But at the same time we will never give in to the logic of intimidation and threats , "" he said .
"" Two issues or components have to be considered .
One is the concerns of the Europeans ; the other is the inalienable rights of the Iranian nation .
"" Iran was not seeking the bomb , he said : it should be remembered that Iranians had been the victims of weapons of mass destruction , supplied by the west to Saddam Hussein during the Iran - Iraq war . ""
Even during that war , we never entertained the idea of using such weapons ourselves , "" he said .
"" We believe they are illegal and inhuman .
We believe the real might of any country relates to the relationship between the people and their government .
After years of isolation , this country continues to stand tall .
It is because this relationship exists here . ""
Dr Jalili said Iran had already gone much further , in terms of a previous two - year suspension of its enrichment research and additional inspections , than it was obliged to do under the nuclear non - proliferation treaty ( NPT ) .
"" Basically , what we are dealing with here is nuclear apartheid : some countries have rights and others are told they do not have similar rights ...
I also believe our insistence on our position helps maintain the spirit of the NPT . ""
Dr Jalili described Mr Ahmadinejad as an "" old friend of mine "" whose principal offence , in the eyes of the US and Britain , was to speak truth to the world .
The president 's political philosophy began and ended with Islam , he said .
He was leading a "" big debate "" about how to reinsert justice and spirituality into political life .
He defended Mr Ahmadinejad 's controversial threats against Israel . ""
He is saying that the state of Israel will fade away if the democratic process is observed [ a reference to Iran 's official view that all Palestinians , including those living in exile , should be given a vote ] , and they will only have themselves to blame .
"" There were no difficulties over Judaism inside Iran , he claimed , pointing to the presence of a Jewish MP in Iran 's parliament and a 25,000-strong Jewish community nationwide .
The problem lay instead with Israel and with a "" small group of people imposing their views "" on the rest of the world .
"" It is time the international community did something about this . ""
The peddling of conspiracy theories and other intolerant , fundamentalist thinking is nothing unusual in Iran .
One newspaper this weekend labelled France 's president , Nicolas Sarkozy , a "" Zionist henchman "" for his warnings about Tehran 's nuclear activities .
Dr Jalili 's unexpected elevation to the supreme national security council may afford him a significant position from which to promote his views .
But the conclusion of many western analysts that his appointment marks a major advance for the Ahmadinejad faction in Iran 's divided government may prove simplistic .
The move coincides with changes in other key portfolios , including the oil and industry ministries and , possibly , foreign affairs .
Mr Ahmadinejad is under withering fire over his failure to grow the economy , petrol rationing , and so far unsuccessful privatisation measures .
Even conservative MPs have criticised Dr Jalili 's inexperience .
There is evidence , meanwhile , that UN- and US - orchestrated financial sanctions are biting .
All this appears to indicate uncertainty about nuclear policy , growing unease over Iran 's international position , and a resulting , accelerating power struggle in ruling circles as the possibility of a reformist - pragmatist comeback in parliamentary elections next March looms large .
Dr Jalili 's advance is but one move on a much bigger board .
And the fact that the displaced Dr Larijani will still attend the Rome talks , as the personal representative of the supreme leader , suggests the struggle is growing ever more intense ."

In a lengthy interview conducted in Tehran last year , Dr Jalili , then a deputy foreign minister , offered a robust world view that simultaneously revealed a lack of understanding and experience of the west largely typical of the Ahmadinejad government .
Although his official brief covered Europe and North America , he has spent little or no time there .
Dr Jalili 's views on the nuclear issue reflected this odd mixture of moral certainty and political disingenuousness .
"" We have announced time and again that we believe in the logic of negotiation .
But at the same time we will never give in to the logic of intimidation and threats , "" he said .
"" Two issues or components have to be considered .
One is the concerns of the Europeans .
The other is the inalienable rights of the Iranian nation .
"" Iran was not seeking the bomb he said .
Iranians had been the victims of weapons of mass destruction , supplied by the west to Saddam Hussein during the Iran - Iraq war .
They regarded them as illegal and inhuman .
Dr Jalili said Iran had already gone much further , in terms of a previous two - year suspension of its enrichment research and additional inspections , than it was obliged to do under the nuclear non - proliferation treaty ( NPT ) .
"" Basically what we are dealing with here is nuclear apartheid .
Some countries have rights and others are told they do not have similar rights ...
I also believe our insistence on our position helps maintain the spirit of the NPT . ""
Dr Jalili described Mr Ahmadinejad as an "" old friend of mine "" whose principal offence , in the eyes of the US and Britain , was to speak truth to the world .
The president 's political philosophy began and ended with Islam , he said .
He was leading a "" big debate "" about how to reinsert justice and spirituality into political life .
He defended Mr Ahmadinejad 's controversial threats against Israel . ""
He is saying that the state of Israel will fade away if the democratic process is observed [ a reference to Iran 's official view that all Palestinians , including those living in exile , should be given a vote ] and they will only have themselves to blame .
"" There were no difficulties over Judaism inside Iran , he claimed , pointing to the presence of a Jewish MP in Iran 's parliament and a 25,000-strong Jewish community nationwide .
The problem lay instead with Israel and with a "" small group of people imposing their views "" on the rest of the world .
"" It is time the international community did something about this . ""
Such conspiracy theories are nothing unusual in Iran .
One newspaper this weekend labelled France 's president , Nicolas Sarkozy , a "" Zionist henchman "" for his warnings about Tehran 's nuclear activities .
Dr Jalili 's unexpected elevation to the supreme national security council could help him promote his views .
But the conclusion of many western analysts that his appointment marks a major advance for the Ahmadinejad faction in Iran 's divided government may prove overly simplistic .
The president has recently won battles over other key portfolios , including the oil and industry ministries .
But he is under fire over his failure to grow the economy , petrol rationing , and so far unsuccessful privatisation measures .
Even conservative members of parliament have criticised the choice of the inexperienced Dr Jalili .
There is evidence , meanwhile , that UN- and US - orchestrated financial sanctions are biting .
All this appears to indicate uncertainty about the wisdom of Iran 's nuclear confrontationalism , unease over its international position , and a resulting , accelerating power struggle in ruling circles as the possibility of a reformist - pragmatist comeback in parliamentary elections next March looms large .
Dr Jalili 's advance is but one move on a much bigger board .
And the fact that the displaced Dr Larijani will still attend the Rome talks , as the personal representative of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , suggests the struggle is growing ever more intense ."
2007-10-26,"Iran 's former president Mohammad Khatami has fuelled speculation of a possible comeback by bluntly accusing his successor , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , of peddling false statistics to hide rising inflation and unemployment .
Mr Khatami , who was regarded as a reformist , said Iran 's worsening economic woes did not tally with the rosy picture painted by the government , and warned that officially endorsed "" lies "" would destroy Iranians ' trust in the Islamic system .
Speaking at the financial paper Sarmayeh , he said : "" Unfortunately , it has become customary that the real issues are concealed and portrayed in some other ways .
If there is inflation ... it will not remove the reality if you say it does n't exist , or alter scientific standards to achieve a desired result .
If society feels it is being told lies , it will damage mutual trust , not only between elites and decision - makers but also between people and the authorities .
"" Central bank statistics put inflation at 15.8 % but independent economists say it is well over 20 % and official figures exclude sharp rises in housing and rent .
President Ahmadinejad , who vowed to alleviate poverty by redistributing Iran 's oil wealth , has rejected criticism about rising prices , blaming Mr Khatami 's government of 1997 to 2005 .
Mr Khatami 's comments represent his first explicit criticism of his successor and follow predictions that he might run in the 2009 presidential election .
Mohammad Ali Abtahi , a former aide to Mr Khatami , said the remarks were intended to prepare for a reformist revival at the March parliamentary elections .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's radical backers have attacked Mr Khatami , fearing his popularity among liberal voters .
Ultra - conservatives wanted him defrocked as a cleric after he was pictured shaking hands with a woman during a trip to Italy ."

2007-11-13,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's president , raised domestic tensions over the country 's nuclear policy to higher levels yesterday by labelling his opponents "" traitors "" who are working for the west and threatened to expose them in a political witch - hunt .
In an offensive that exposed the fissures within the Islamic republic 's power structure , he accused "" domestic elements "" of seeking to sabotage Iran 's uranium enrichment programme and said they had inflicted more damage than its foreign enemies . ""
If the domestic elements do not stop imposing pressure over the nuclear issue , they will be unmasked before the Iranian nation , "" Ahmadinejad told students at Tehran 's science and industry university . ""
The conditions will not remain where we sit back and watch while traitors do whatever they want .
One day , eventually , I will reveal what has happened behind the scenes on these issues .
It will serve as a lesson for future generations and show what a fierce conflict has occurred .
"" The president did not name the alleged culprits but his comments appeared directed at a circle close to Hashemi Rafsanjani , a former president and powerful establishment figure , who has accused Mr Ahmadinejad of endangering the country with his confrontational rhetoric .
Ahmadinejad 's remarks coincided with a call from Rafsanjani for national unity in the face of "" very serious "" external threats .
In an apparent reference to his differences with the president , Rafsanjani said "" division "" existed inside Iran but internal conflicts could destabilise the country . ""
The US has troops based everywhere , we have no specific information about their decisions and we do n't know what is about to happen .
Why should we be concerned over ( internal ) conflicts ?
"" he said .
"" Differing views have always existed but the Qur'an stresses the avoidance of confrontation .
God considers confrontation as a characteristic of hellish people ... those who go to hell favour quarrel and conflict . ""
His sentiments contrasted with those of Ahmadinejad , who has repeatedly dismissed the possibility of a US military strike against Iran .
Ahmadinejad claimed some regime insiders had urged the west to increase the pressure on the country 's nuclear programme while providing inside information about its political system .
"" They even sent somebody to the enemy regularly to inform them about what was happening inside the system , "" Ahmadinejad said .
"" We know about the remarks one of them made to the enemy , saying , ' Why do n't you pursue the matter ?
Why do you postpone issuing the [ UN security council ] resolution and why have you weakened your pressure ?
You should impose pressure to force them back ' . ""
Another of Ahmadinejad 's targets appeared to be Hossein Mousavian , a Rafsanjani ally and former nuclear negotiator under the 1997 - 2005 reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami , who was detained earlier this year on unspecified espionage charges before being released on bail .
"" We arrested one person due to espionage in this regard and since then the judge has come under so much pressure to acquit the spy , "" he said .
The president may also have been targeting Hassan Rowhani , Iran 's chief negotiator during Khatami 's presidency .
Rowhani , who favours compromise , angered Ahmadinejad 's supporters recently by travelling to Berlin for talks with the EU 's foreign policy chief , Javier Solana .
But he cancelled the meeting after pro - government media accused him of pursuing a parallel diplomatic agenda .
While moderates have urged compromise Ahmadinejad has declared Iran 's nuclear case "" closed "" and last week claimed it had reached the landmark of operating 3,000 centrifuges .
Last month , he appeared to have scored a victory after Iran 's chief nuclear negotiator , Ali Larijani , resigned following rows over strategy .
But Mr Larijani retains a role as representative on the supreme national security council of Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has the final say on all state matters ."
2007-11-20,"Dog is supposed to be man 's best friend
but it may not be the right mode of protection if you are a pious leader of an Islamic state with a reputation for forgoing luxuries .
So perhaps , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the Iranian president , should have known better than to allow his security team to deploy four highly trained sniffer dogs in a search for explosives before his appearance at the national press exhibition .
It hardly helped that journalists attending the event at Tehran 's youth artistic and cultural centre were ordered outside for more than two hours to enable the animals to scour the venue unhindered , before it was declared safe for the president .
The incident has put Ahmadinejad in the dog house with his critics , who point out the contradiction between the canine deployment and classic Islamic teaching that dogs are unclean .
Grumbles have also been heard about the cost of the animals , which were bought for a total of £ 314,000 .
Some complained that the dogs contradicted the president 's carefully crafted "" simple - life , justice - seeking , anti - luxury "" image , the conservative website Tabnak reported .
A contrast has also been drawn between Ahmadinejad 's decision , on taking office , to remove costly Persian rugs from his presidential quarters , in keeping with his ascetic persona .
Iran quietly broke its religious taboo on dogs several years ago when officials decided to use them at airports and border crossings for detecting drug traffickers .
However , their deployment in the protection of the head of state may be unprecedented , at least since the 1979 Islamic revolution ."
2007-11-22,"An Iranian newspaper , the Islamic Republic daily , has launched a personal attack on the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , accusing him of behaving immorally towards political rivals .
The paper , which is close to Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Khamenei , says Ahmadinejad 's behaviour is dangerous for Iran .
( Via BBC )"
2007-11-26,"When Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the Iranian president , wanted to create a forum to trumpet his populist political message without the interference of media and opposition catcalls he launched his own blog .
But he may have failed to reckon with the merciless mud - slinging and sarcasm that characterises communication in much of cyberspace .
Far from being a repository of fawning admiration , Ahmadinejad 's blog has attracted criticism as scathing as that voiced by his known adversaries .
Somewhat gleefully , the reformist newspaper Etemad reported yesterday that some respondents were venting their spleen with little regard for pleasantries .
One writer - calling himself Sadegh Al Ebrahim - sarcastically congratulated Ahmadinejad on his success in creating new jobs through last summer 's decision to ration petrol .
"" In our city before rationing there were two petrol stations , of which one was always shut .
But now , due to you , we have 3,000 petrol sellers , "" the message reads , hinting at the rampant black market .
Another , claiming to be "" on behalf of the more than 50 million people who did n't vote for you "" , berates Ahmadinejad for high unemployment and high inflation .
The writer says : "" Instead of useless provincial trips , fake propaganda on state TV and unrealistic news fed to you by your aides , you should come to the heart of the society . ""
The critical messages are counter - balanced by many others that are positive , including several that praise Ahmadinejad for his performance in September at Columbia University in New York ."
2007-11-27,"He denounces it as the "" Great Satan "" and frequently dismisses its power , but the overtures of the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , to the US seem to grow ever more extravagant .
Having failed to win a response with an 18-page letter to President George Bush or to a request to visit the site of the September 11 2001 attack on New York , Ahmadinejad has offered himself as an observer in next year 's presidential election .
The proposal came in a speech to volunteers with the Basij , a pro - regime militia .
He said he was prompted by a belief that Americans would vote against the current administration in a truly free poll .
However , the terms of Ahmadinejad 's offer appeared to betray some confusion about the potential candidates .
"" If the White House officials allow us to be present as an observer in their presidential election we will see whether people in their country are going to vote for them again or not , "" he said .
The US constitution prevents Bush from seeking a third consecutive term , while no member of his administration is expected to be in the running in next November 's poll .
Bush and international human rights groups voiced doubts about the legitimacy of Iran 's 2005 presidential election , which brought Ahmadinejad to power .
More than 1,000 potential candidates were disqualified by the guardian council , a powerful body of clerics and judges .
Some domestic critics pointed out yesterday that Ahmadinejad 's idea clashed with his government 's opposition to allowing independent observers at Iranian elections .
The interior ministry , controlled by one of the president 's most hard - line allies , has rejected pressure for party representatives to be allowed to oversee proceedings at polling stations for next March 's parliamentary poll .
The election is expected to provide a major test of Ahmadinejad 's popularity .
Leading regime figures , including two former presidents , Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami , have warned against possible attempts to rig it through mass candidate disqualifications and other measures ."
2007-11-27,"An Iranian court today acquitted a former nuclear negotiator of spying for the British government but convicted him of acting against the Islamic authorities .
The Iranian government charged Hossein Mousavian earlier this month with passing classified information to foreigners , including the British embassy , and the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , called him a "" spy "" and "" traitor "" .
"" There were three charges raised against Mousavian : spying , keeping confidential documents and propagating against the ruling system .
He was found not guilty of the first two but found guilty of propagating against the system , "" a judiciary spokesman , Ali Reza Jamshidi , said .
Jamshidi did not provide details on the possible sentence against Mousavian , who served as a nuclear negotiator under the 1997 - 2005 reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami .
The former negotiator was briefly detained in May but is currently free on bail .
Mousavian , a moderate who favours compromise over Iran 's dispute with the west , became the focus of a domestic power struggle between Ahmadinejad and the previous president , Hashemi Rafsanjani .
The attacks on Mousavian , a former ambassador to Germany , appeared to be part of a broader offensive against a coalition of pragmatic conservatives and reformists allied to Rafsanjani , who has emerged as a rallying figure for opponents of the hardline president .
Rafsanjani , chairman of the experts ' assembly , an important clerical body , has warned that Ahmadinejad 's confrontational rhetoric risks pushing Iran into a military confrontation with the US .
When the spying accusations were made two weeks ago , Mohammad Atrianfar , a political commentator and confidant of Rafsanjani , told the Guardian : "" Ahmadinejad has made stupid allegations and now the intelligence ministry is forced to back them up .
The intelligence ministry has never mentioned espionage allegations in its report against Mousavian .
"" They are singling out the British embassy because Britain and the US are close allies and British policy is subordinate to America 's .
Reacting against Britain is tantamount to reacting against America . ""
An embassy source called the spying accusations "" ridiculous "" ."
2007-11-28,"A former Iranian nuclear negotiator was cleared of spying for the west yesterday in a verdict that appeared to vindicate opponents of the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
It was announced that Hossein Mousavian had been acquitted of espionage and possessing classified documents which he allegedly passed to the British embassy in Tehran .
Mousavian , an ally of Ahmadinejad 's main rival , Hashemi Rafsanjani , was convicted of a lesser charge of "" propaganda against the system "" and given a suspended sentence .
The verdict has yet to be confirmed by Tehran 's chief prosecutor .
The president 's spokesman , Gholamhossein Elham , hinted that the government might yet seek to reopen the case .
Mousavian , who served as nuclear negotiator during the 1997 - 2005 reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami , was detained for a week last spring before being freed on bail .
The case became symbolic of a struggle for control over Iran 's nuclear policy between Ahmadinejad , who refuses to suspend uranium enrichment , and pragmatists close to Rafsanjani who favour dealing with the west .
Ahmadinejad intervened directly in the case against Mousavian two weeks ago by publicly labelling him a "" spy "" while accusing critics of the government 's nuclear policy of being "" traitors "" who were colluding with western governments .
Ahmadinejad said Mousavian 's supporters were pressuring the judge to clear him , but said he would not escape "" justice "" .
Yesterday , Alireza Jamshidi , spokesman for the judiciary , appeared to condemn the comments .
And the conservative newspaper Jomhouri Eslami , thought to have links to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , last week denounced the president 's attacks as "" immoral "" and said the courts should consider prosecution ."
2007-12-05,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , today said the US intelligence report confirming his country had abandoned its nuclear weapons programme was a "" declaration of victory "" for his people .
The National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) report , which was declassified on Monday , disclosed for the first time that Iran had not been pursuing a nuclear weapons development programme for the past four years .
"" This is a declaration of victory for the Iranian nation against the world powers over the nuclear issue , "" said a jubilant Ahmadinejad said during a visit to Ilam province in western Iran .
He addressed thousands of people who greeted the remarks with celebratory whistles .
"" This was a final shot to those who , in the past several years , spread a sense of threat and concern in the world through lies of nuclear weapons .
Thanks to your resistance , a fatal shot was fired at the dreams of ill - wishers and the truthfulness of the Iranian nation was once again proved by the ill - wishers themselves . ""
The International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , the UN nuclear watchdog , gave a more nuanced response to the NIE .
Mohamed ElBaradei , the IAEA director general , who has had prickly relations with the Bush administration , called the US intelligence report a "" sigh of relief "" because its conclusions gelled with his agency 's own findings .
While not going so far as to give Iran a clean bill of health , ElBaradei told reporters in Brasilia , Brazil , that Iran had been "" somewhat vindicated in saying they have not been working on a weapons programme , at least for the past few years "" .
The Chinese foreign minister , whose country has reluctantly supported previous UN sanctions against Iran , today ducked questions as to whether Beijing would support further measures .
Yang Jiechi told the Chatham House thinktank in London that Iran had the right to pursue peaceful nuclear energy , but said it should abide by relevant UN resolutions calling on its stop uranium enrichment . ""
China hopes all parties will work together to peacefully resolve this issue , "" Yang said .
Yesterday , the Iranian leadership called for plans for new United Nations sanctions against the country to be dropped in the face of the report .
Existing sanctions had been rendered "" illegal "" and the report showed the Bush administration 's warnings about Iran 's intentions were "" baseless and unreliable "" , said Iran 's foreign ministry spokesman , Mohammad Ali Hosseini .
The report 's conclusions have forced America 's European allies , as well as fellow UN security council members , to re - evaluate policy towards Iran .
The report will make it harder for the US , Britain and France to persuade China and Russia to impose tougher UN security council sanctions , despite George Bush 's assertion at a press conference yesterday that Iran remained dangerous .
China 's ambassador to the UN , Guangya Wang , was asked by reporters whether the report made the prospect of new UN sanctions less likely .
He said : "" I think the council members will have to consider that , because I think we all start from the presumption that now things have changed . ""
While the chances of a US military strike on Iran 's nuclear facilities are receding , the Israeli government continues to insist Tehran poses a serious danger and that the US is misreading the intelligence .
Against a background of triumphalism in Tehran , Hosseini said the findings destroyed the legal basis for last year 's decision to refer Iran 's case to the security council .
The council has passed two sets of sanctions and is debating a resolution that would impose a fresh embargo .
However , Iranian officials claimed that this was now unlikely .
The report was greeted as a vindication by supporters of Iran 's radical president , who has fought a bruising battle for control over nuclear policy with pragmatists who have accused him of pushing Iran towards a military confrontation with the US .
Ahmadinejad 's spokesman , Gholamhossein Elham , said : "" Americans should pay the price for their words .
"" Iran has said throughout the crisis that it has embarked on uranium enrichment for purely civilian purposes , to help meet its electricity and other energy needs .
But the US and Britain continue to suspect it is a step towards building a nuclear weapon .
US and European diplomats said yesterday that the new intelligence estimate would not derail the movement towards a new set of sanctions .
A senior Russian official agreed , adding that the new measures could be implemented in the next few weeks .
The British foreign secretary , David Miliband , said suspicions of Iran 's intentions would continue as long as it persisted in enriching uranium in the absence of any nuclear power stations in which the fuel could be used .
"" That 's why people have fears about what the enrichment is for .
That 's why they have fears about the dangers of weaponisation , "" the foreign secretary said .
At a meeting in Paris on Saturday , senior officials from the five permanent members of the security council and Germany - the six - strong contact group - agreed in principle on a new set of UN sanctions .
Participants said Russia and China , which had been reluctant to tighten sanctions , had given a green light to a limited range of targeted measures .
The details are being discussed in phone calls between representatives of the six countries this week .
Moscow and Beijing appeared to have softened their resistance after an IAEA report last month found that Iran had rapidly expanded its uranium enrichment .
What they said : Intelligence reports 2005 Assess with high confidence that Iran currently is determined to develop nuclear weapons despite its international obligations and international pressure , but we do not assess that Iran is immovable .
2007 Judge with high confidence that in fall 2003 Tehran halted its nuclear weapons programme .
Judge with high confidence that the halt lasted at least several years .
Department of Energy and National Intelligence Council have moderate confidence that the halt to those activities represents a halt to Iran 's entire nuclear weapons programme .
Assess with moderate confidence Tehran had not restarted its nuclear weapons programme as of mid-2007 , but we do not know whether it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons .
Judge with high confidence that the halt was directed primarily in response to increasing international scrutiny and pressure resulting from exposure of Iran 's previously undeclared nuclear work ."
2007-12-08,"Since his surprise election in 2005 , Iran 's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has widely been seen in the west as a dangerous demagogue with an alarming anti - Semitic streak , a man determined to take his country into a bruising showdown with the US .
His jarring style of anti - diplomacy has alienated virtually every country bar his declared allies in Cuba , Belarus , Venezuela and Syria .
On the one hand , his repeated collisions with the west have played to a rising wave of nationalism at home , and to the anger felt by the wider Islamic world .
On the other hand , he has also given America the potential excuse it has long sought to open hostilities .
One third of the US navy is massed in the Persian Gulf .
Whether a war were fought over Iran 's bid for a nuclear bomb or its alleged meddling in the ongoing carnage in Iraq little matters to the Bush administration .
Even a National Intelligence Estimate , published on Monday , that downplayed Iran 's nuclear weapons intentions does not really matter to the hawks
- they are ready to go .
In Europe , what was once unthinkable - backing another , potentially bloody conflagration against an Islamic power while the world is still bogged down in Iraq - has become a possibility .
Even before Bush started talking in October in Old Testament terms about a third world war being triggered by Iran , the French foreign minister had argued back in September that Iran 's nuclear programme was bringing the west to the brink : "" We have to prepare for the worst , and the worst is war . ""
Ahmadinejad , however , has suckered the west into a confrontation for his own reasons .
He has derailed Iran 's economy , squandering record oil profits and paralysing the banks .
He has alienated his core support among the poor .
He has brazenly attempted to rig clerical institutions , the machinery that turns out Shiadom 's future leaders , so as to consolidate his rule .
Such an audacious plan , from a man who could once do no wrong , has triggered a momentous fight - back from affronted clerics and senior political figures .
Those who know him best say Ahmadinejad has come to realise that it will take something momentous for him to hold on to power come the parliamentary elections next March - hence his provocations .
Vali Nasr , an Iranian - born professor of international politics at Tufts University in Boston , goes so far as to say , "" He desperately needs war with America to survive politically in a country that is as exhausted as Europe and the US is with his increasingly volatile grandstanding . ""
For a visitor , the sheer size of Iran 's capital is daunting .
Tehran is one of the modern megalopolises , twice as populous as London .
The wealthy northern suburb of Elahieh is often highlighted as proof of the emerging new Iranian society : photographs of Gucci - clad women and men in jeans are beamed around the world as evidence of change .
However , it soon becomes obvious that its influence is small .
More than 10 million poor , religiously conservative residents dominate the city .
They migrated here during the years of the Shah , when bungled land reforms allocated such small parcels of agricultural land to them that no one could produce enough food to survive .
Today they live cheek by jowl : the chadoris , women swathed head to foot in semi - circular black robes , and the basijis , men and boys who dress like their president and who have been recruited by the million to the Basij volunteer military force of the Revolutionary Guards .
They are the country 's plain - clothed ears and eyes , as well as the morality police , enforcing a rigid vision of a Shia state .
In the city warehouses are filled with workers trimming silk carpets destined for western showrooms they will never visit .
Most have never held a passport and have little interest in seeing the world .
Ahmadinejad had barely travelled , too .
He talked proudly when he stood for the presidency in 2005 of having left Iran only once , "" for a short trip to Austria . ""
He appeared to be one of the people .
In Iran what you wear is a political statement , and he sounded and dressed as they did .
Conjuring the time when he was among the disenfranchised mass who signed up to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps established by Ayatollah Khomeini , he promised to take people back to the pious values of 1979 .
A turning point in his campaign came when he released a short film showing him dining cross - legged on the floor of his simple , working - class home on Tehran 's 72nd square , his wife hidden by her chador .
Compare this with the image of his opponent , Hashemi Rafsanjani , two - time president , a wealthy ayatollah whose family owned hundreds of acres of pistachio orchards in Kerman province , and who produced ill - judged campaign ads showing him discussing the lack of entertainment options with a group of affluent , western - dressed teenagers from Elahieh .
When Ahmadinejad appeared on the international stage he seemed unconventional , even shabby , among the crowd of sombre suits ; his uniform was a crumpled jacket , buttoned - up shirt and beard , his nervous smile made him seem modest and simultaneously embarrassed .
World leaders overlooked his apparent ignorance of the niceties of international diplomacy and his street vernacular , drawn from the working - class suburb of Tehran where he grew up , the youngest son of a migrant worker .
But it soon became clear that this former student of traffic management and one - time mayor of Tehran was advancing a radical conservative agenda .
An intensely religious man , he began to sound Talibanesque in his pronouncements .
There were no homosexuals in Iran , he said ( without explaining this was because they were forced to undergo sex - change operations at the government 's expense ) .
Women belonged in the chador , he declared , as his administration published figures showing that in just two months 160,000 had been charged with being insufficiently veiled earlier this year .
Public hangings - which had not been seen in the capital for many years - returned to the city 's streets and were broadcast on live TV .
After drawing international condemnation for restarting Iran 's stalled nuclear programme , Ahmadinejad raised the temperature by sacking Ali Larijani , Iran 's vastly experienced secular nuclear negotiator , replacing him with a former militia leader .
Throughout Tehran , there are 60ft - high posters depicting Iran 's "" martyrs "" , the million soldiers who fell during the eight - year war with Iraq in the 80s .
The ghosts of the dead fill the city .
Ahmadinejad has invoked them at every stage of his political career .
He reminds people that when he was mayor in 2003 , he had martyrs ' bodies exhumed from their provincial cemeteries and reburied in the capital 's squares so that wherever people walked there were memories of loss beneath their feet .
Patriotism was only one string he pulled .
At the heart of his election message was a claim that chimed with the deeply religious poor : a divine force protected him and would help the Iranian people get closer to God , too .
In a series of national roadshows that became his political signature , he insisted that messengers from heaven had told him that the Mahdi , a messiah - like figure who Iranian Shi'ites believe vanished in AD873 , was about to return to the mortal world bringing salvation .
According to the sacred texts of Shi'ism , the Mahdi 's reappearance would establish a just Islamic society at a time of war and chaos and , citing one such text , Ahmadinejad and his spiritual advisers declared that that time was now .
It must surely rank as one of the most hyperbolic manifesto pledges ever made , but still , it got Ahmadinejad elected .
The new president then shared his vision with the UN general assembly in September 2005 .
During his address he appealed to God to "" hasten the emergence of ... the Promised One ... ""
After he left the meeting , Ahmadinejad had a conversation with an Iranian cleric , describing how he had felt the hand of God in the UN , which was recorded and uploaded on to the net : "" I felt it myself ... for 27 to 28 minutes all the leaders did not blink .
They were astonished ...
It 's not an exaggeration , I was looking . ""
But there was no point making such grand pledges if he could not provide the evidence .
Ahmadinejad began furiously investing millions of pounds to animate his claim that the Mahdi was coming .
And he chose to do it at one of the holiest places in Iran .
The city of Qom , 90 miles south of Tehran , on the edge of the Kavir desert , is the scene of frenzied building work .
According to local tradition , the Mahdi once appeared here in a vision to a shepherd watering his sheep at a well on the outskirts of the city , and devotees believe that it will be from this well that he re - emerges .
For several hundred years a small mosque , known as Jamkaran , stood on the vision site , attracting pilgrims who scribbled their innermost desires on scraps of paper that they threw into the well .
One of Ahmadinejad 's first acts in power was to have his entire cabinet sign a piece of paper that was also put down the well , a pledge to transform the mosque into a place worthy of the Mahdi 's presence .
Soon after , posters started appearing on the streets of Tehran declaring , "" He 's Coming .
"" There was talk of a fast train link to connect Jamkaran to the capital in case the Mahdi turned up without warning , enabling politicians to get to the mosque in double - quick time .
Today it resembles an Islamic Lourdes .
The modest mosque has been embellished with 100 ft minarets , blue - tiled domes and new prayer halls .
Hundreds of thousands of devout , working - class Iranians flock to the site , especially on Tuesday nights , the reputed time for the Mahdi 's reappearance .
Ahmadinejad shuttles here almost weekly , and whenever he appears he is mobbed like a rock star .
A holy of holies in an ultra - conservative country , it is out of bounds to western tourists who catch only a blur of blue tiles from their coaches as they are escorted down the motorway to the archaeological sites of Esfahan , Persepolis and Shiraz .
As the sun burns red , dozens of cranes and earthmovers move along the horizon .
Every road leading to the mosque is filled with chadoris , who run , clutching bags and children , to claim a small patch on the tarmac perimeter where they will eat , sleep and pray through the night .
Ahead , the mosque is illuminated by a hundred thousand bulbs .
Tears wash down the faces of worshippers as they catch their first glimpse of the minarets .
As the muezzin 's call wells up from deep inside the complex at 7 pm , the crowds kneel as one in prayer .
The maddah , or storyteller , takes the crowd on an emotional late - night journey . ""
Come on , come on !
I have a fear of not seeing You ! ""
he cries , appealing to the Mahdi , as the crowds sway and sob .
He tells stories of martyrs who have come back in his dreams to warn that Iran has lost its way , and that until it returns to its revolutionary roots they will not reach paradise .
Only Ahmadinejad can be trusted to carry out this exorcism , he warns .
It is a message that resounds with every family here , as all have lost brothers , sons and fathers .
"" We must follow our president who is brave and facing western aggression , "" says Farida Milani , from Yazd , who is here with her wheelchair - bound mother .
Before Ahmadinejad came along , Qom was home to one vitally important shrine , and it was not Jamkaran .
The city was world - famous among Shias as the burial spot of Lady Fatima Masuma , a direct descendent of the Prophet Muhammad , whose death here more than a millennium ago transformed a previously forlorn desert settlement into a pilgrimage site .
It became a centre of learning in the 20s , when Shi'ite intellectuals , including Ruhollah Khomeini , began gathering .
When he returned from exile in 1979 as Grand Ayatollah Khomeini , he resettled in Qom , from where he led the country 's transformation into an Islamic republic , turning the city 's seminaries into its ideological engine .
Soon there would be 300 madrasas taking in 50,000 students .
Qom was tasked with fomenting Iran 's theocratic foreign policy ; it became a place much feared by the US and Israel .
Both accuse it of being a provocative source of inspiration for students affiliated to extreme groups , including Hezbollah and Hamas , who come to study at the government 's expense .
Some have also returned to seek sanctuary , including Imad Mughniyah , Hezbollah 's special operations chief , spotted in Qom in 2001 .
He has been accused of masterminding the 1983 bomb attacks on the US embassy and marine barracks in Beirut that killed 304 , the 1985 hijacking of TWA flight 847 and numerous kidnappings of westerners in Beirut .
More recently , he was blamed for the attack on a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires in 1994 that left 92 people dead .
For these reasons Qom has been identified as a possible target in any US attack .
Ahmadinejad knew that scores of high - ranking clerics would be affronted by his manipulation of the Mahdi story , derisive of his scholarship and critical of what many saw as a cynical attempt to undermine the one man who had the authority to sack him .
His claims challenged Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's Supreme Leader and commander - in - chief , whose official title , vali - e faqih , means "" God 's jurisprudent on earth "" - a direct link with the divine that would be superseded if the Mahdi showed his face .
Although the Supreme Leader had done more than anyone to get the president elected , issuing directives to all Revolutionary Guardsmen and their families to vote for him in 2005 , relations soured after Ahmadinejad proved not to be the malleable figure Khamenei had hoped for .
Frozen out by the theocratic establishment , Ahmadinejad fought back .
He began lambasting many of the city 's septuagenarian clerics for being corrupt and soft , reminding people that some had become rich during the Iraq war trading weapons and selling ration cards .
In Qom , Ahmadinejad sought to eclipse long - established seminaries with his own to bring the city under his control .
Government money was poured into the Imam Khomeini Institute , a hardline madrasa whose scholars were charged with trawling through religious treatises to find evidence that the Mahdi 's re - emergence at Jamkaran was imminent .
Ahmadinejad placed in charge Mohammad Taghi Mesbah - Yazdi , a cleric who would soon become known as an ayatollah , a significant promotion without the normal years of study .
Mesbah - Yazdi has become Ahmadinejad 's ideological mentor .
They first met in the early 80s when Ahmadinejad attended a series of his lectures on the philosopher Martin Heidegger , who had been championed by the Nazis .
Here , Ahmadinejad found the noisy , blue - collar nationalism that he would imbue with hyper - spirituality .
He created a vision of a pious and soldierly people easing the path of the coming Mahdi .
Abbas Milani , director of Iranian studies at Stanford University in California , who has studied Ahmadinejad 's background , explains .
"" Mesbah - Yazdi forged key elements of an Islamic pseudo - fascist ideology founded on a sour brew of anti - Semitism and Heideggerian philosophy ...
This in turn has informed Ahmadinejad 's world view . ""
An enthusiastic supporter of the death penalty and public floggings , Mesbah - Yazdi was recently elected to the Assembly of Experts , the body responsible for choosing the next Supreme Leader .
He has made it clear he is eyeing the top job .
The ground floor of the Imam Khomeini Iistitute is given over to a large bookshop exclusively selling works by Mesbah - Yazdi .
His image is plastered on every wall .
Turbaned mullahs enter the building on their way to class .
Students come from all over the Muslim world - Pakistan , Afghanistan , Lebanon , Palestine ; there are even a handful from America .
A white - bearded ayatollah approaches and asks , "" What are you doing here ? ""
After a garbled explanation about wishing to study Islamic law , he introduces himself as Ayatollah Haghani , Yazdi 's director of international affairs .
He is clearly uncertain , but agrees to show the library where mullahs hunch at study stations , their turbans neatly hanging on a hat - rack in the corner .
The shelves are stacked with volumes by Marx , Popper and Russell , and in the periodicals section are anti - terrorism papers produced by Chatham House , in London .
The ayatollah 's phone trills a Qu'ranic prayer ; whoever is on the line is angry that foreigners are here .
"" You must leave , "" the ayatollah says curtly .
The elevator descends in silence and as the doors open on the ground floor three meaty security guards jump in .
Behind them is the unmistakable figure of Mesbah - Yazdi .
He brushes past , scowling , in a whirl of coffee - coloured robes .
He signals for visitors to be escorted out .
Controlling Qom was only one plank in Ahmadinejad 's strategy .
As a parvenu , wresting power from the political establishment has been equally important , and he has done it with gusto , filling the cabinet and major administrative bureaucracies with former Revolutionary Guards and intelligence officials .
His new intelligence minister is Gholam Hossein Mohseni - Ejehei , a man whom only a little digging reveals has been linked to the murders of Iranian political activists .
The new interior minister , Mostafa Pour Mohammadi , sat on a three - person committee in 1988 that ordered the execution of thousands of political prisoners .
Even the culture ministry has been turned upside down .
Its new chief is Hossein Saffar Harandi , a university buddy of Ahmadinejad and former Basij leader , whose first act in office was to call upon Iranian musicians to compose a symphony of support for Iran 's nuclear programme , and who has shut down almost every newspaper and website critical of the regime .
"" It 's not what they did in the past that matters but what they do in the future , "" the president has said in defence of his men .
This is precisely what worries Shirin Ebadi , the Nobel peace prize - winning Iranian lawyer , who told the Guardian , "" The situation in Iran has worsened considerably with these new men in power . ""
Women who complain of rape have been stoned .
The age of consent for girls has been lowered to nine .
Children have been convicted and executed for adult crimes .
Barbers have been jailed for shaving beards .
Yet , for all Ahmadinejad 's efforts to control every aspect of Iranian life , his authority has begun slipping away .
Some of Iran 's most senior clerics have questioned the manipulation of the Mahdi story .
Mesbah - Yazdi has been derided as Professor Crocodile ( the name Mesbah rhymes with temsah , the Persian word for the reptile ) , while Ahmadinejad has been accused of "" endangering the reputation of Islam and the Qur'an "" by Javadi - Amoli , an ayatollah at the Qom seminary school .
But the most damaging criticism comes from Iran 's Grand Ayatollahs , a band of 19 leaders whose spiritual authority remains unquestioned .
They , too , have become enraged by the upstart in his Revolutionary Guards suit .
At his modest headquarters , Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri , Khomeini 's former deputy , sits cross - legged , a skullcap covering his remaining wisps of grey hair .
He does not hold back .
He accuses the current regime of despotism , over - reliance on Iran 's security forces and disrespect for the seminary .
"" Power brings ignorance , and those in power now have forgotten what the revolution was for . ""
He pauses , aware of the weight of his words .
"" They have become extremists , going in a different direction . ""
The Jamkaran extravaganza has enraged the grand ayatollah .
"" People go expecting to see the Mahdi sitting there in a corner .
They are being misled .
It is wrong .
The Mahdi is very dear to our people and the politicians are taking advantage . ""
He has one more thing to add : "" Iran needs to put aside all the bad blood and America needs to stop interfering , before it creates another Iraq or Afghanistan . ""
At his Qom madrasa , Grand Ayatollah Yusef Saanei has begun to make some startling pronouncements : women having equal rights to men , non - Muslims being treated as respectfully as Muslims , listening to music being permissible , men being allowed to shave their beards .
On his wall is a framed quote from Khomeini , saying , "" I have raised Mr Saanei like a son of mine . ""
"" America thinks Iran is violent and responsible for all its ills , "" he says .
"" It is up to our leaders to show the world the difference between Sunni and Shia Islam , to show Shia Islam has never condoned terrorism and renounces terrorist groups like al - Qaida . ""
Unlike his president , he wants reconciliation . ""
After Khomeini died , the spirit of what he believed in died away , too .
If the current president continues , there will be no new generation . ""
Saanei taps his cane . ""
If the people now in power carry on , Iran will crumple from the inside and die . ""
Outside Qom , dissent is building , too .
People have begun to question how far Ahmadinejad is prepared to go with his nuclear sabre - rattling and whether the country can defend itself against US "" surgical strikes "" .
Among targets already identified by Washington hawks are Revolutionary Guards facilities , many of them in the capital .
Last month Jomhuri Eslami , an influential conservative newspaper , chastised the president in a front - page editorial for describing officials who advocated restraint in the nuclear stand - off as "" traitors and spies "" .
However , the most significant threat to Ahmadinejad is his appalling economic record .
As soon as he became president , he began increasing state control and destroying the free market .
Ministry of finance officials were replaced by clerics with no economic experience ; Ayatollah Mesbah - Yazdi was appointed Ahmadinejad 's main economic adviser .
Together they have implemented a series of disastrous reforms dictated by the principles of Sharia law .
After Mesbah - Yazdi likened banks to loan sharks , Iran 's independent banking sector was crippled by a raft of restrictive measures .
A low - interest loans scheme for small businesses , designed to encourage job creation , collapsed .
Millions have been spent on popular measures , such as the "" Love Fund "" to help poor young men meet the costs of marriage , and the minimum wage has been increased by 60 % .
But more than 20 % are now out of work and the urban poor , Ahmadinejad 's backbone , have been floored by rising prices .
Iran should be one of the richest countries in the world .
It is , after all , the fourth largest oil producer and has the second biggest natural gas reserve .
But the president has squandered windfall oil revenues on billion - dollar no ... #8209;bid contracts awarded to companies owned by friends in the Revolutionary Guards .
In the past 18 months , millions of dollars worth of oil revenue is thought to have disappeared into individual pockets as the military has moved seamlessly into building airports , producing oil and opening mobile phone networks , transforming Iran into a military state not unlike its neighbour , Pakistan .
Mohammad Ghouchani , editor of the Hammihan newspaper , says , "" Ahmadinejad likes to present himself as Robin Hood , taking from the rich to help the poor , but his scattergun and ill - conceived policies have achieved precisely the opposite . ""
Evidence that this message is sinking in came in September when a poll found that 56 % of Ahmadinejad 's supporters in 2005 would not turn out for him again .
Meanwhile , Hashemi Rafsanjani , the reformist he outwitted in 2005 , has gathered strength .
Iran 's former ambassador to the UK , Hossein Adeli , has appealed to the west to back down . ""
This country , this baby of revolution , has been living 30 years in isolation under a deep sense of insecurity , and the majority of Iranians are tired .
We are trapped in a wall of deep mistrust and suspicion with the US and UK that has now reached its peak .
Our officials and your officials sit in their respective positions issuing rhetoric for their domestic audiences .
They 're worrying about winning the next election , not communicating with the other side or seeing the ground realities .
"" Adeli should know .
Until Ahmadinejad forced him out of office in December 2005 , he had been handling secret discussions between Tehran , London and the Bush administration .
What should happen next ?
"" We have to start talking .
If we do n't , Ahmadinejad will be saved by people who have begun to loathe him .
Washington needs to stop , take breath and realise we have many common strategic interests .
Iran 's most important strength , our weapon , is our influence in the heartland of the world . ""
Instead of open hostilities , Adeli calls for investment coupled with an offer of unconditional negotiations from Washington .
He believes that would provide the impetus for some of the four million wealthy Iranians exiles who took a trillion dollars worth of capital with them to return and launch a campaign for the Islamic Republic 's first ever democratic election .
It is one that Ahmadinejad would now most likely lose ."
2007-12-08,"There are few obvious parallels between Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the religiously devout Iranian president , and Jim Morrison , the famously hedonistic lead singer of the Doors .
But now the fact that the pair are to share a cinematic bond in the form of biopics directed by Oliver Stone is generating stern disapproval in conservative circles in Tehran .
Ahmadinejad accepted the request earlier this year by the director to make a documentary about him .
A bad move , according to one of Iran 's most influential conservative newspapers , which has tried to convince him to reconsider .
Keyhan , which has links to the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , pointed to Stone 's 1991 movie , The Doors , to show that he is unsuited to film the Iranian president , whom the paper called "" an intellectual and peacemaker "" . ""
The Doors was in commemoration of one of America 's perverted and half - mad singers ; someone who urinated on the head of his fans during his concerts and enjoyed doing so , "" wrote the article 's author , Elham Rajabpour .
One scene depicts Morrison , who died in 1971 , being arrested for alleged indecent exposure during a concert in Miami .
The singer denied the charge but was convicted .
Authorities in Florida recently discussed issuing a posthumous pardon .
Former band members criticised aspects of the film as distorting Morrison 's character .
Rajabpour argued that Stone would act similarly with Ahmadinejad and invent a false portrayal to serve "" Zionist "" interests . ""
Hoping that he refrains from alterations , deliberate manipulations and damaging the honour , power and the interests of the Islamic system is an irreparable mistake which will bring us nothing but regret and remorse , "" she wrote .
As evidence , Rajabpour cited Stone 's 2004 historical epic , Alexander , about the Macedonian king , Alexander the Great , whom she calls "" a hated figure amongst Iranians "" .
The film was heavily criticised in Iran for portraying Alexander sympathetically while ignoring his role in the destruction of Persepolis , seat of the Achaemenid dynasty , in 330BC .
An Ahmadinejad aide announced this week that Stone had requested permission to travel to Iran to discuss the project .
The Tehran Times reported that the president had agreed on condition that the director uses only "" real scenes "" from his life .

2007-12-18,"No , not the primaries !
The real contest is for Time magazine 's Person of the Year , who will be revealed tomorrow .
Making the short list : Al Gore , Steve Jobs , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Condoleezza Rice , Hu Jintao , David Petraeus , Vladimir Putin , and JK Rowling .
It 's a packed field , with Rowling and Gore currently leading an online survey of Time readers .
But in this year of hard - boiled politics , expect a politician to stand out .
Gore , Rice and Ahmadinejad were all short - listed last year , so any of them could be due for a make - up call .
But Rice has largely withdrawn from the world stage this year , and that NIE report stole all the thunder that a vote for Ahmadinejad would bring .
The safe money 's on Gore .
( Of course , if you insist on focusing on those upcoming primaries , we all remember who won in 2001 . )"
2008-01-06,"As a literary journalist in Iran , I have often wondered why the country 's greed for literature abruptly ended when President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took office in 2005 .
There was a time when great Persian poets such as Hafez , Rumi or Khayyam were present in people 's daily lives , permeating their speech even in the very rural regions , but now books scarcely figure in a country once recognised by its literature .
Today , you are unlikely to see signs of literary life in Iran .
Writers face immense challenges in getting their works read .
Crackdowns imposed by Ahmadinejad 's government have plunged publishing into crisis . '
They [ the governmental authorities ] have not only made the publishers stop working , but also have put writers in a situation in which they have no inclination to write , ' says Mahmoud Dowlatabadi , author of the Persian 10-volume bestseller Kelydar , who refuses to give his next book to a publisher as a protest against the government 's clampdown .
After the 1979 Islamic revolution , the government imposed strict rules on book publishing .
Since then , the Ministry of Culture has been charged to vet all books before publication , mainly for erotic and religious transgressions .
All books , including fiction , are required to conform to Islamic law .
Iranian literature showed brief signs of resurgence during the cultural thaw that took place when Mohammad Khatami became President in 1997 .
Khatami created a more open cultural atmosphere by allowing a huge number of books to be published .
But the literary spring of Khatami 's era was fleeting .
A new regime of censorship began when Ahmadinejad took office .
The cultural ministry imposed rules requiring renewed permits for previously published books .
As a result , many books have been deemed unsuitable for publication or reprinting .
Many world classics , contemporary novels and dozens of international bestsellers have been banned , including a Farsi translation of Dostoevsky 's masterpiece The Gambler , Tracy Chevalier 's bestseller Girl With a Pearl Earring , William Faulkner 's As I Lay Dying and some books by Virginia Woolf , Marguerite Duras , Dan Brown and Woody Allen .
Recently , when the conservative website Tabnak drew attention to the plot of Gabriel Garcia Marquez 's Memories of My Melancholy Whores , the Farsi translation of the book was banned , despite having gained permission from Ahmadinejad 's cultural ministry some months earlier .
The crackdown includes Persian books , too .
The Cock , a novel written by Ebrahim Golestan , a renowned Iranian writer and film - maker based in Britain , is banned even though it had previously been granted permission by the ministry of Khatami 's rule .
Moreover , almost all books by Sadeq Hedayat , the internationally renowned author of The Blind Owl , have been refused publication .
The tortuous process of getting official approval for publication is another reason why Iranian writers are becoming reluctant to publish new works . '
It 's almost nine months since my translation of Kurt Vonnegut 's A Man Without a Country was given to the ministry .
Since then we have had no response , ' says Mojtaba Pourmohsen , whose interview with Saghi Ghahraman , an Iranian lesbian poet based in Canada , published in Shargh Daily , became an excuse for the government to close down the most prominent reformist paper of the country .
' I 'm too tired now .
I have no energy to go on with literature in Iran . '
There is nothing in Kurt Vonnegut 's book that needs censorship , ' he adds , claiming that the ministry grants permission apparently arbitrarily .
Pourmohsen 's own collection of poems , One Man Tango , has also been waiting to get official approval for the past six months .
Lengthy waits are not the only problem for Iranian writers .
The novelist Yaghoub Yadali was recently illegally imprisoned for 40 days by the government for several passages from his novel Mores of Unrest , a book which had ministry permission .
He was eventually charged with dissemination of falsehood and sentenced to three months ' imprisonment , as well as being required to write three mandatory articles .
This led to an outcry among many Iranian writers , who believe that the government is invading the imagination .
Reza Ghassemi , an important Iranian novelist based in France , recently published his new novel , The Abracadabra Murmured by Lambs , on the internet in a free ebook PDF format instead of facing government censorship and the formal permission procedure .
His enovel has been reviewed and welcomed by the huge Iranian blog community much more warmly than if it had been published on paper .

2008-01-15,"President George Bush was last night working to persuade Saudi Arabia to maintain its support for a revived , but fragile , Israeli - Palestinian peace process and to confront Iran across the Middle East .
Arriving in Riyadh on the penultimate stage of his regional tour , Bush went into talks with King Abdullah as the administration prepared to notify Congress of a $ 20bn ( £ 10.2bn ) arms package for the Saudis - satellite - guided weaponry and other high - tech munitions - highlighting the oil - rich kingdom 's privileged relationship with Washington .
As on his previous stops in the Gulf , the president was given a red carpet welcome , but no public engagements are planned in a country where a recent poll found that his popularity rating was just 12 % - less than that of Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , or the al - Qaida leader and renegade Saudi , Osama bin Laden .
US officials say Saudi support is crucial as the Israeli - Palestinian talks re - launched at the Annapolis summit last November get under way , with the hugely ambitious target of a peace treaty by this time next year .
But King Abdullah is unwilling to do anything that could be interpreted as the "" normalisation "" of relations with Israel , without seeing substantial progress towards a peace agreement .
Talks on the most sensitive "" core "" issues - borders , Jerusalem and refugees - were held yesterday between Tzipi Livni , Israel 's foreign minister , and Ahmed Qureia , the chief Palestinian negotiator , in line with the Annapolis timetable and Bush 's visit to Israel and the West Bank last week .
But Livni and Qureia agreed only to continue talks in private . ""
When negotiations are conducted [ in front of ] the cameras , this results in the adoption of more extreme positions , the distortion of what is said in the negotiating room , the raising of expectations , followed by disappointment and violence , "" Livni said .
Separately , Ehud Olmert , Israel 's prime minister , told the Knesset foreign affairs and defence committee : "" I am not sure we can reach an agreement and I am not sure we can reach implementation , but I would be betraying my job and the state of Israel if I did n't give it a chance . ""
Oil and weapons supplies are both crucial elements of the US - Saudi relationship .
But the kingdom 's political clout , and its Arab and Muslim legitimacy , are as important as its financial reach : thus the effort made to persuade its foreign minister to go to Annapolis .
Riyadh also brokered a key deal between the PLO and the Islamists of Hamas last year , only to see it collapse when Hamas took over the Gaza Strip .
The Saudis have consistently demanded that Israel halt all settlement activity as a sign of its seriousness about peace .
Olmert makes a distinction between "" illegal outposts "" and other larger settlement blocs , which he hopes to keep under a peace deal .
Bush 's talks in Riyadh were also expected to deal with Iranian policy in the region , including Tehran 's nuclear ambitions and its support for radical groups such as Hamas , Hizbullah in Lebanon , and Shia militias in Iraq .
Iran was the main focus of the president 's keynote speech of his trip in Abu Dhabi on Sunday .
Stephen Hadley , Bush 's national security adviser , said democracy and human rights in the Arab world were also being raised in every meeting .
"" I think they would say they are pursuing the freedom agenda , "" he said of Bush 's Arab interlocutors .
"" Obviously they have different political systems from us , different history , different cultural context .
But these folks ... are on board with the freedom agenda and they are pursuing it in their own fashion . ""
Battle of bedtime Visiting seven countries in as many days is taking its toll on an American president who famously likes to be tucked up in bed by 9.30pm but finds that Arab leaders - used to escaping the searing heat of the day - like to do business into the small hours .
In what correspondents are calling "" the battle of the bedtime , "" Bush was forced to eat a formal dinner at a Saudi palace around the time he is normally getting into his pyjamas .
Briefing aboard Air Force One suggested this may be the latest meeting the president had ever had .
"" This is a matter of great sensitivity , "" a Bush administration official said with a smile .
Bush 's late night was at an encampment where Abu Dhabi 's crown prince , Sheik Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan , raises horses and prize falcons ."
2008-01-16,"Only one man can rescue the embattled Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , from his growing domestic unpopularity .
That man is George Bush .
Ahmadinejad faces elections in March and an increasingly disaffected clergy , but he feeds on Bush 's antagonism .
This week Bush has duly obliged .
He has raced round the Middle East drumming up support for his Iranian foe .
Bush has denounced Ahmadinejad at every turn .
He has offered to sanction him , embargo him , isolate him , even bomb him .
He has portrayed him as a monster of evil and "" leading sponsor of terror "" .
He has showered the Saudis and the Gulf states with $ 20bn of weapons to confront him "" before it is too late "" .
When Ahmadinejad thanked "" divine intervention "" for making him president in 2005 , he should also have thanked God for having first selected Bush .
To have Washington as your enemy in these parts is to have every man your friend .
The dwindling raggle - taggle army of neocons is currently trying to portray US strategy in the region as a success after all .
This is entirely based on news from Iraq , where General David Petraeus has reduced the death rate of Americans and Iraqis from the astronomical to the merely appalling .
Since this conflict is far too dangerous to report properly , world opinion is reliant on a notional monthly kill rate to measure progress .
Petraeus , or at least the exhausted citizens of Iraq , have thus offered the White House a respite from horror .
The tactics are exactly those that Petraeus 's predecessors rejected in the past four years of mayhem .
He has encouraged and armed local militias , good and bad , to defend their communities .
In Anbar province , this has meant backing Sunni sheikhs and former Ba'athist gangsters , styled "" the awakening "" , to face down the al - Qaida mafia .
This was suggested by British MI6 agents in 2003 and rejected by the Pentagon .
In Baghdad , the tactic has meant building fortified and ethnically cleansed ghettos , mostly in Sunni areas , and arming them against the former campaign of slaughter by the Shia militia / police , many of whom work for the interior ministry .
Within the ambit of American protection , this has meant a modified return to normality .
Petraeus has proved a wise commander .
His men do not go kicking their way into women 's bedrooms , shooting family parties and shelling villages , which was Donald Rumsfeld 's way of winning hearts and minds .
There is also a limit to how long any citizenry can remain in a state of medieval siege .
Markets will struggle to operate .
Schools will try to reopen .
Elsewhere , old habits die hard .
Last week the biggest bombing raid since the invasion was unleashed on a populated area in Diyala , north - east of Baghdad , causing as yet unrecorded devastation .
On Monday one of Iraq 's most distinguished judges was left unprotected and was assassinated .
Water and power supplies to the capital are said to be worse than ever .
No effort has been made to stave off the conflict likely to envelop oil - rich Kirkuk , let alone a simmering war on the Kurdish - Turkish border .
In other words , it remained unthinkable that Bush 's lap of honour round the region last week might include the city he supposedly "" liberated "" .
Sooner or later the Americans must withdraw from the enclaves they have de facto partitioned .
A new , homegrown , home - fought balance of power will be found in Iraq .
Petraeus 's strategy is certainly the best yet tried by the coalition , but it offers no long - term surety of law and order because it is backed by no political settlement .
It is worth noting that Basra , from whose civil chaos British troops withdrew in despair last year , has dropped from the radar .
It is strange what happens when alien forces withdraw from occupied lands .
Stripped of its post-9/11 retribution , bombast and militarism , American policy towards the Muslim world has been to promote democracy as the one sure means to prosperity and peace .
Condoleezza Rice and others declared in 2005 that "" the bad old days of favouring stability over democracy are over "" .
Even friends such as the Egyptians and the Saudis were mildly rebuked for turning a deaf ear to this message .
As policy , this was noble .
If America ( and Britain ) were ill - advised to call it a crusade , there are certainly worse causes to promote .
Yet Bush and Tony Blair were unaware of how their inevitably "" neo - imperial "" wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , coupled with American support for Israel 's expansionism , would render their crusade hopelessly hypocritical .
Muslim democracy is a moot concept , but it has made a sort of imprint on Iran , Palestine , Lebanon and even Iraq and Pakistan .
Yet it was not these leaders that Bush graced with a visit this past week .
He went to Kuwait , Abu Dhabi , Saudi Arabia , Egypt and Bahrain , where he was feted with gifts of gold , rubies , emeralds and diamonds .
It sure beat a walkabout in downtown Baghdad .
In Pakistan , Bush continues to back dictatorship and must suffer the resulting Taliban "" blowback "" in Afghanistan .
In Palestine he ignores the winner of an election , Hamas .
He appeases Hosni Mubarak 's dictatorship in Egypt and is craven to the autocrats of Saudi Arabia .
His spokesman , Steve Hadley , challenged on what such rulers contribute to democracy , could only bumble that "" these folks are on board with the freedom agenda , and are pursuing it in their own fashion "" .
Stability trumped democracy after all .
Insofar as any strategy lay behind the Bush trip , it was a hope that the monarchs of the Gulf might support the US in military action against Bush 's pet hate , Ahmadinejad .
Yet if there is one lesson these rulers know , it is to live at peace with the wilder regimes to their north and east .
Indeed , keeping them wild suits them fine .
Dubai is built on the funk money of the region .
The last thing the Gulf intends to do is help the US to yet another war , least of all with Iran .
Meanwhile , Bush can not even see the final irony .
The one thing that might unseat Ahmadinejad is a poor showing against the moderates in the half - free parliamentary elections in March .
If his party does badly , there is a chance of a more reasonable regime taking over , reasonable on anything from Iraq to nuclear weapons .
At least it is worth waiting .
Yet Bush does everything to generate the paranoia on which Ahmadinejad bases his electoral appeal .
He threatens him with the constraint of war , and thus dilutes the constraint of democracy .
Does Bush not realise how attack from outside helps an embattled leader ?
Has he forgotten 9/11 ?

2008-01-21,"The political authority of the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , suffered a serious blow today after the country 's most powerful figure sided with MPs by ordering him to supply cheap gas to villages undergoing power cuts amid an unexpectedly harsh winter .
In a humiliating rebuff , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader who has the final say over all state matters , ordered the enactment of a law requiring the government to provide £ 500 m of gas supplies from emergency reserve funds .
Ahmadinejad had refused to implement the measure , accusing parliament of exceeding its powers in passing the bill in response to plummeting temperatures and gas cuts , which have left many areas without heating during the country 's coldest winter in years .
At least 64 people are reported to have died after gas supplies were turned off in sub - zero temperatures .
The cuts , belying Iran 's status as possessor of the world 's second biggest natural gas reserves , have provoked public outrage and threaten to turn a mood of rumbling unhappiness into a winter of discontent for Ahmadinejad .
The president , who was elected on a platform of economic justice for the poor , rejected parliament 's measure on budgetary grounds and blamed the gas cuts on neighbouring Turkmenistan , which has stopped supplies to Iran over a payment dispute .
But in a letter to the parliament 's speaker , Gholamali Hadad - Adel , Khamenei unceremoniously overruled Ahmadinejad , writing : "" All legal legislation that has gone through [ the required ] procedures stipulated in the constitution is binding for all branches of power . ""
Khamenei 's intervention is the latest in a series of recent signals that he is losing patience with a president to whom he once showed staunch loyalty , defending him whenever he came under fire from political opponents .
The supreme leader once described Ahmadinejad 's government as Iran 's best since the 1979 Islamic revolution , but in a speech this month in the central city of Yazd , he conspicuously refrained from praising it .
Instead , he put it on a par with previous administration , saying that "" the government has certain unique characteristics , but like any other government there are mistakes and shortcomings "" .
Reports from inside Iran suggest Khamenei has grown increasingly disenchanted with Ahmadinejad 's economic record , which has been marked by surging inflation and dramatic rises in basic food and housing costs .
Such misgivings have been given added piquancy by a report last month from 16 US intelligence agencies concluding that Iran abandoned its nuclear weapons programme in 2003 .
The report appeared to ease the threat of American military strikes against Iran 's uranium enrichment activities , which Ahmadinejad had used to silence opponents and clamp down on domestic dissent .
The diminishing external threat appears to have emboldened the president 's opponents in the run up to parliamentary elections on March 14 .
It may also have removed the need for Khamenei to keep his displeasure quiet .
Previously the supreme leader had condemned criticism of Ahmadinejad as undermining national unity in the face of "" enemy "" threats .
But in a possible sign of his changing attitude , Khamenei recently appointed Mohammad Zolghadr as deputy head of the armed forces for Basij just weeks after Ahmadinejad sacked him as deputy interior minister ."

2008-01-24,"President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is set to become the first Iranian leader since the revolution to visit Baghdad after the Iraqi foreign ministry announced he had accepted an invitation , at a time of high tension in the Gulf .
The visit was confirmed by the Iranian president 's office , but no firm date has been agreed .
The visit would mark a breakthrough in relations between Iran and Iraq , which fought an eight - year war in the 1980s that cost hundreds of thousands of lives .
It would also represent a challenge to American influence in Iraq , at a time when the US and Iran are vying for regional supremacy .
US warships in the Gulf have fired across the bows of Iranian patrol boats once and come close another two times over the past two months .
Adding to the tension , there will be a security council debate next month on a new sanctions package aimed at forcing Iran to suspend uranium enrichment .
A draft resolution , agreed by the council 's five permanent members and Germany at a meeting in Berlin on Tuesday , marginally increases sanctions imposed last year .
It adds a few names to a list of Iranian officials subject to a travel ban because of their links to the nuclear and missile programmes , diplomats said yesterday .
The threat of new sanctions was shrugged off yesterday by the chief Iranian negotiator , Saeed Jalili , who insisted that Iran had the right to develop a nuclear industry .
"" We need 20,000 megawatts of nuclear electricity and for this we have to build 20 nuclear power plants , "" Jalili said .
In a string of earlier resolutions , the security council has ruled that Iran has not done enough to persuade the international community of its peaceful intentions .
The International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) has given Iran until mid - February to resolve outstanding questions about its past nuclear activities , and the agency 's report could have an impact on the timing and severity of the final sanctions resolution .
Jalili held talks last night with the European foreign policy chief , Javier Solana , who has served as a negotiator on the issue for the major powers .
A US national intelligence estimate published in November concluded that Iran had suspended a covert nuclear weapons programme in 2003 , but George Bush has said that Iran remains a threat ."
2008-02-04,"Iran graphically signalled its ambition to join the elite group of countries in space today by claiming to have reached orbit with a rocket capable of carrying satellites .
In a move that drew criticism from the Bush administration , Iranian television beamed footage of a rocket called Explorer-1 being fired after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad gave the launch order .
Officials in the control room were heard chanting "" God is great "" as it lifted off .
State TV said the rocket had reached "" space "" , generally defined to begin at 100 km ( 62.5miles ) above Earth .
Ahmadinejad hailed the launch as a major landmark .
"" We need to have an active and influential presence in space .
Building and launching a satellite is a very important achievement , "" he told a televised ceremony at which he officially opened Iran 's first space centre .
A White House spokesman , Gordon Johndroe , condemned the test , saying : "" It 's unfortunate Iran continues to test ballistic missiles .
This regime continues to take steps that only further isolate it and the Iranian people from the international community . ""
Today 's launch was a forerunner to the anticipated firing of Iran 's first satellite , Omid ( Hope ) , scheduled for early next year .
Iranian scientists have reportedly spent 10 years developing the satellite .
If fired successfully , Iran will become the 11th nation to have its own satellite in orbit since the Soviet Union launched Sputnik in 1957 .
A satellite jointly developed by Iran and Russia was launched on Russian soil in 2005 .
Iran insists the satellite will be used to improve telephone and internet services while also monitoring natural disasters .
But some analysts say it will also give the Islamic regime the capacity to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles , which are guided using satellite technology .
Bhavini Rama , a research fellow with the Centre for Defence and International Security Studies , said Iran had not released enough detail about its satellite to assess whether it could be used for such purposes .
"" It 's probably going to be an observation satellite and could be used for intelligence purposes , "" she said .
"" This is a big step for Iran but it still has a long way to go in terms of catching up with the US and other space powers . """

2008-02-05,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's populist , attention grabbing president , has reportedly accepted an official invitation to visit Egypt - new evidence of an accelerating rapprochement between the Islamic Republic and the most populous country in the Arab world .
In recent months , Ahmadinejad has being busy wooing the pro - western Arab countries , crossing the Gulf to the United Arab Emirates and going on the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia ; he is also due to visit Baghdad shortly , the first Iranian president to go to the Iraqi capital since the 1979 revolution .
By traveling to Cairo to see the president , Husni Mubarak , he will be significantly improving relations between Iran and the Sunni Arab world , badly strained by the view that Iran has been the greatest beneficiary of the US - led war in Iraq and has fomented sectarianism across the Middle East .
But Tehran municipality - which Ahmadinejad once headed - will have to make an important domestic decision before he can fly off to see the pyramids .
In the heart of the capital , close to the Valiassr Mosque , is a serious sticking point in Egyptian - Iranian relations : a huge mural commemorating Khaled al - Islambouli , the Egyptian army officer who assassinated President Anwar Sadat in October 1981 .
Egypt executed him and three of his co - conspirators by firing squad soon afterwards .
The four - story mural on the Imam Khomeini building depicts the "" martyr "" Islambouli behind bars ; the adjacent street bears his name , despite several promises to change it .
It serves a similar purpose to Bobby Sands Avenue ( formerly the more flattering Winston Churchill avenue ) near the British embassy , which commemorates the eponymous IRA hunger striker : thus do ideology and provocation go hand in hand .
Relations between Tehran and Cairo have been bad since the 1979 revolution , when Khomeini swept to power and the deposed Shah Mohamed Reza Pahlavi was granted asylum in Egypt , where he died later ( and was given a state funeral by Sadat ) .
In 1980 , fearing the export of Iran 's revolutionary ideas , and preferring Ba'athists to mullahs , Egypt backed Iraq in its bloody eight - year conflict with Iran .
Egyptian soldiers fought alongside Saddam Hussein 's forces and held back the Iranian revolutionary guard in Basra for weeks in 1986 .
Since 2003 , Egypt , like the other Sunni states , has been deeply unhappy with the Shia ascendancy in Baghdad , Iran 's support for the country 's Shia militias , for Lebanon 's Hizbullah and the Palestinian ( Sunni ) Islamists of Hamas .
In recent months the Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip and the Israeli and international blockade has brought alarming instability to Egypt 's back door .
Iran 's nuclear ambitions are another worry - Cairo wants to see the Middle East as a nuclear - free zone .
Last week , Mubarak and Ahmadinejad held an icebreaking phone call before Egypt issued the formal invitation via the Iranian parliament speaker , Gholam Ali Haddad Adel .
But Tehran says there are no immediate plans for a visit and there are distinct signs of reticence on the Egyptian side , a sense that Tehran 's charm offensive has not been quite as successful as the Iranians like to suggest .
Mubarak , warned the al - Hayat columnist Abdullah Iskandar , should beware "" sugarcoated Iranian words in the Land of the Pharaohs "" .
The burgeoning thaw between Cairo and Tehran has already attracted critical attention from both the US and Israel .
Egypt is the second largest recipient of US aid after Israel ; it was also the first Arab country ( in that landmark year of 1979 ) to sign a peace treaty with the Jewish state - one of the reasons Sadat was gunned down by Islambouli and his fellow jihadists , some of whom went on to help set up al - Qaida .
Analysts say the rapprochement has been facilitated by last November 's controversial US intelligence community finding that Iran is no longer working on a nuclear weapons programme , as Washington long claimed .
And Mubarak is said to be pleased to have an opportunity to irritate the Americans .
Iran , meanwhile , is trying hard to play down the significance of the Islambouli mural .
In Tehran , as elsewhere , all politics is local : a previous attempt by reformers to remove the mural and/or change the name of the street brought protests from groups anxious to preserve the memory of "" one of the heroes of Islam 's international movement , "" as the hardliners put it . ""
The issue is solvable , "" insisted Gholam Ali Haddad .
"" It is one of the issues under discussion but it is not an important issue . ""
But the symbolism - "" glorifying terrorism , "" as the Egyptians complain - remains powerful .
Something will clearly have to give ."
2008-02-11,"On the occasion recently of the 75th anniversary of Hitler 's takeover of power in Germany on January 30 , 1933 , the renowned British historian Ian Kershaw asked the often - discussed question : "" Could something like it happen again ? ""
Among the possible contemporary parallels , Kershaw described Iran 's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as the perhaps most worrying case .
While Kershaw came to the conclusion that "" what happened in Germany in 1933 , and its aftermath , will remain a uniquely terrible episode in history "" , he also emphasised that what happened in the 1930s should serve as a reminder of "" the need for international cooperation to restrain potential ' mad dogs ' in world politics before they are dangerous enough to bite "" .
It is this lesson of history that many Israelis fear Europe , and , most disappointingly , Germany , has not quite learned ; and it is therefore this lesson in history that Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert will try to impress on his German hosts during his visit in Berlin this week .
To be sure , Germany 's efforts to confront its past clearly deserved the praise expressed by some commentators on the anniversary of Hitler 's takeover of power , and few would disagree with the former Israeli ambassador to Germany , Avi Primor , who acknowledged "" the bravery and the humility "" that it took for Germany to build "" memorials to immortalise its own shame "" .
Yet when it comes to the potentially existential threat that Iran 's nuclear ambitions pose for Israel , Germany seems curiously oblivious to the lessons of history .
In an article that was also published in a German newspaper , the American historian Jeffrey Herf has recently criticised "" Germany 's strange silence on Ahmadinejad "" .
When tougher sanctions against Iran were discussed last fall , a Jerusalem Post editorial asked , "" Where 's Germany ? "" , and Ha'aretz featured a piece on "" Germany 's Iranian secret "" .
Noting the sharp contrast between the "" tough political rhetoric "" of Germany 's chancellor , Angela Merkel , and "" the pricey business deals German firms have closed with the Tehran regime , to the tune of $ 5.7 billion in 2006 "" , the article pointed out that Germany was actually "" Iran 's most important trading partner in the European Union "" .
According to a recent report , Germany also remained the European Union 's biggest exporter to Iran in 2007 , with a total trade volume of € 3.5bn of goods , including almost € 1.5bn - worth of engineering products and hi - tech equipment that could be classified as "" dual - use technology "" , ie products that can be used either for non - military purposes or for the creation of nuclear weapons .
Notwithstanding the recent American national intelligence estimate ( NIE ) which asserted that Iran had suspended its nuclear weapons programme in 2003 , Israeli intelligence assessments indicate "" that Iran will attain offensive nuclear capabilities within three years "" .
Moreover , Israeli defence officials continue to believe that Iran "" remains the central strategic threat to Israel , not only because it is striving for the attainment of nuclear weapons but also because of its influence on more imminent threats - such as Hamas , Hizbullah and Syria "" .
While German exports to Iran in 2007 reportedly declined , compared with previous years , there was at the same time "" a dramatic 50 % increase of business going in the opposite direction , with Iranian exports to Germany totalling € 580 m - trade that entails more than just Iranian pistachio nuts "" .
It is thus hardly surprising that a German business paper noted "" growing resistance among the German business class against sanctions "" .
The profitable trade relations between Germany and Iran obviously go a long way towards explaining Germany 's reluctance to get tough with the regime in Tehran .
But Israeli writer Yossi Klein Halevi has suggested that there might also be "" another reason for German blindness on Iran "" .
He argued : "" Germans and Israelis approach the use of force with very different sensibilities .
World War II taught us opposite lessons : for Germans , to suspect power as immoral ; for Jews , to regard powerlessness as untenable . ""
Klein Halevi therefore concluded that it might be a "" misplaced sense of contrition "" that led Germans to believe that they were just "" keeping faith with the lessons of their history "" if they insisted that "" [ all ] problems should be peacefully resolved ; no aggressor is irredeemable "" .
This is , of course , a lesson that most definitely is not validated by the history of the 1930s .
Kershaw may have made a good case to answer no to the question ""
Could something like it happen again ? ""
at the end of January 2008 , 75 years after Hitler took power , but the question will be asked again at the end of September 2008 , 70 years after Neville Chamberlain declared : "" I believe it is ' peace for our time ' . """

In a statement Human Rights Watch said that the religious police who interrogated Fawza Falih and the judges who tried her in 2006 did not give her the opportunity to prove her innocence in the face of "" absurd charges "" .
An appeal court ruled that Falih could not be sentenced to death for witchcraft as a crime against God because she had retracted her confession , but the lower court reimposed the sentence on a "" discretionary "" basis , the statement said .
Associated Press in Beirut Pentagon to shoot down rogue spy satellite
The Pentagon is planning to fire a missile at a rogue spy satellite that was due to fall to earth next month .
US defence officials did not specify why they intend destroying the satellite , but it could be from fear that sophisticated surveillance equipment could end up in the hands of a military rival .
The satellite , which has not worked since its launch , would also pose a danger if it crash - landed as it is the size of a small bus and has hazardous chemicals on board .
The US criticised China for shooting down one of its satellites just over a year ago , seeing it as a hostile action .
Ewen MacAskill in Washington"
2008-02-26,"How far does Iran 's radical president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , live up to his meritocratic principles ?
Not very , according to Amir Farshad Ebrahimi , an opposition blogger exiled in Turkey who - as a former revolutionary guard and Islamic regime insider - once shared Ahmadinejad 's radical outlook .
After taking office in 2005 , Ahmadinejad decried former governments for widespread corruption , cronyism and nepotism .
He promised a root and branch clean out and appointments based solely on competence rather than blood relation .
But in his blog , Goftaniha ( which translates in English as Things To be Said ) , Ebrahimi identifies a list of individuals who owe their positions to family ties to the president .
For example Ahmadinejad 's brother , Davood , heads the powerful president 's inspections unit - which has intrusive investigative powers over a raft of government agencies - while his sister , Parvin , is a Tehran city councillor .
The president 's brother - in - law , Hossein Shobeiri , chairs Mehr - e Reza fund , a charity set up by Ahmadinejad to encourage young people to marry , while Ali Akbar Mehrabian , his nephew , was recently appointed industry minister .
While the 1979 Islamic revolution , which toppled the Pahlavi monarchy , was trumpeted as the death - knell to political dynasties in Iran , close family ties between senior officials is strikingly common inside the Islamic regime .
For instance the daughter of Gholam Ali Haddad - Adel , the current parliamentary speaker , is married to Mojtaba Khamenei , son of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
There are many other family links knotting high - ranking officials into a tightly - bound inner circle .
In promoting his relatives , Ahmadinejad has behaved in line with that political environment .
But in so doing , he appears to have turned his back on the ideals he once loudly and proudly proclaimed ."
2008-02-28,"If you ever wonder who may have the credibility to be a leader of the diverse global Muslim community , there may be a tendency to consider the firebrands who attract headlines .
Would it be Hassan Nasrallah , whose campaign against Israel made him the pin - up of choice from Cairo to Marrakech ?
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , whose defiance of UN sanctions and bellicose rhetoric is popular outside Iran ?
Or even Osama bin Laden , the self styled "" Sheikh "" , whose hate - filled campaign of terror is seen by some as a just jihad against the hegemony of the west ?
But such poster - boys of hate reflect reality less accurately than they do prejudices against the Muslim community .
It should go without saying that the majority of Muslims , whether they live in Karachi or Kuala Lumpur are moderates .
And one of the leaders of this moderate majority is the prime minister of Malaysia , Abdullah Badawi .
Precisely because he is a quiet moderate , many will have heard nothing of his leadership of the Muslim community .
But by the middle of March , Badawi will have completed Malaysia 's four - year stint as chairman of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) , the second largest intergovernmental organisation after the UN .
It comprises 57 Muslim states , ranging from Saudi Arabia and Indonesia to Morocco , and describes itself as "" the collective voice of the Muslim world "" .
Malaysia goes to the polls on March 8 2008 .
The west should take a little bit more notice of this moderate Muslim leader because Badawi , as prime minister and chairman of the OIC , has been playing an important role in building bridges between the Muslim world and the west , and in trying to make real improvements to the lives of people living in Islamic countries .
His contribution - like his personality - has been made in a modest , thoughtful and deliberate way , but that should not detract from the efforts he has put in .
Unlike Iain Duncan Smith , he is a "" quiet man "" politician who has actually achieved something .
Another stereotype that is important to break down is that the Muslim world is populated by universally oil - rich , resource - rich countries .
Of the 57 countries in the OIC , some 31 are classified as among the world 's least developed ; the bottom five of the list are all Muslim countries .
Together , the OIC accounts for 20 % of the world 's population but only 5 % of global GDP .
Badawi refuses to accept as "" inevitable "" that unemployment rates in Muslim countries are double the global average , that nearly one third of the populations are illiterate , and that women continue to face many disadvantages .
Quite apart from the increasing importance of trade from and among Muslim nations as a result of globalisation , Badawi 's argument has been that the cause of much of the social unrest , terrorism and extremism lies in the poverty , ignorance and squalor of much of the population of the Muslim world .
Tackling these threats to peace , progress and stability have been central to Badawi 's tenure at the OIC .
As a result , the OIC agreed a new development agenda in December 2005 with the signing of the Makkah Declaration .
The declaration focused firmly on the need for economic and social development in the Muslim world to help resolve the challenges of poverty , illiteracy and backwardness , and to promote quality of life issues , prosperity , peace and stability .
The Makkah Declaration is a success for Badawi 's moderate and mainstream brand of progressive Islam .
That said , Badawi has not had it all his own way .
Insufficient progress has been made towards achieving the declaration 's objectives .
Of course , there are criticisms that he should have gone further and faster on anti - corruption measures .
Badawi needs to renew his push toward eliminating corruption - something that features in his election manifesto .
Indeed there are ongoing concerns about corruption , in the police , for example .
But compared with its neighbours , such as Thailand , Indonesia and the Philippines , Malaysia has made progress .
Addressing the annual meeting of the World Islamic Economic Forum ( WIEF ) , held in Kuala Lumpur last year , Badawi asserted that there is a need for a clear and shared commitment to eradicate poverty , illiteracy and unemployment across the Islamic world .
Badawi was the driving force behind the creation of the WIEF , which brings together government , business leaders , academics and other leaders to promote greater commercial links between Muslim states and identify best practice in business development and trade .
The emergence of a new economic agenda for the Muslim world rests on three pillars , according to Badawi : enhancing economic and commercial links within the Muslim world , advancing a modern progressive interpretation of Islam , and - crucially - improving cooperation between the Muslim world and the west .
But Badawi has also been at pains to make the case that development of a new economic agenda also requires reform within the Muslim world and the emergence of an Islam with a progressive worldview .
This is not a one - way street .
There is a strong recognition that in order to gain improved cooperation with the west , there has to be an understanding in the west that Islamic countries should not be stereotyped , when some are modern , progressive and even liberal democracies .
In his opening address to the WIFE , in May 2007 , Badawi took a stand by saying that poor governance was still a regrettable feature of many Muslim countries .
Quite bravely , he argued that tackling corruption and the abuse of civil and political liberties are central to creating a literate and informed society . ""
[ The ] Muslim world will progress farthest when it unlocks and develops this potential , through quality education at all levels , "" he argued , stressing that this "" will never be achieved if some Muslims continue to neglect the right to education and work for women "" .
Badawi 's vision of a progressive Islam has also been at the heart of his engagement with the west .
He advocates a theory known as Islam Hadhari , or "" civilisational Islam "" , which argues for a positive relationship between Islam and economic and technological development .
In January , Badawi was a key participant in the Alliance of Civilisations forum , hosted by the Spanish prime minister , José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , in Madrid .
As Dr Farhan Ahmad Nizami , director of the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies , has said , Malaysia 's leadership in this dialogue is crucial :
This is one of the most important issues of the modern world : better understanding between the Islamic world and the west .
What is needed is really the building of bridges between Muslim and western societies , bridges which are strong enough to carry the weight of differences and that can cover the divide that separates them .
It is therefore important that a prosperous , self - confident nation like Malaysia is playing a pivotal role in this dialogue .
It was this argument that Badawi made to the international community at Davos recently .
He used the opportunity of a shared platform with Tony Blair and other leaders to make a proposal that there should be a new era of building bridges between east and west , that it was crucial to develop concrete initiatives for inter - faith cooperation , and that only with real partnership rather than rhetoric could the world hope to tackle extremist tendencies .
Such leadership can be dangerous in the face of a radical Islamist minority viewpoint - of the kind espoused by Nasrallah , bin Laden and the like .
The bold and imaginative approach taken by Badawi to build bridges with the west , drive a progressive Islam , and tackle corruption and poor governance in the Muslim world , has not always made him friends at home .
In fact , in the election campaign he is currently fighting , the challenge comes from an alliance of opposition parties led by a conservative Islamic party committed to introducing Sharia law .
Despite this , Badawi has stuck firmly and resolutely to his own vision of Malaysia as a modern , progressive Islamic country , a multiracial , multicultural and multiparty democracy that looks outwards to the rest of the world and rejects the insularity and isolationism of the extremists .
It is time we in the west recognised and supported this brand of moderate leadership ."
2008-03-03,"The presence of foreign powers in Iraq was a "" humiliation "" to the region and they should leave , the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , said today .

He is the first Iranian leader to visit Iraq since the two countries fought an eight - year war in the 1980s .
Describing the presence of foreign forces in Iraq as an "" insult to the regional nations and a humiliation "" , Ahmadinejad said : "" We believe that the major powers who have come to the region … should respect the will of nations and leave this region .
That 's the best service they can offer these nations .
"" The US is expected to cut its troop levels to about 140,000 by July after last year 's military surge .
General David Petraeus , the top US commander in Iraq , has indicated that he wants to hold off making additional troop - cut recommendations until the security situation is assessed .
The additional troops that began arriving in Iraq in early 2007 have been credited with temporarily quelling sectarian violence , especially in Baghdad .
Apart from being at loggerheads over Iraq , the US and Iran have clashed over Tehran 's nuclear enrichment programme .
Today , the UN security council is expected to adopt a third round of sanctions against Iran for its failure to comply with UN resolutions to halt enrichment , which can produce fuel for nuclear power plants or atomic weapons .
The resolution calls for more travel and financial restrictions on certain Iranian individuals and companies and makes some restrictions mandatory .
Two earlier sanctions rounds were approved unanimously in December 2006 and March 2007 .
The new sanctions represent a moderate tightening from the two previous rounds .
Diplomats said the Bush administration had failed to get tougher measures through after a US intelligence report confounded expectations in December by saying that Iran had scrapped its nuclear weapons programme in 2003 .
In a report last month , however , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) said that while it had made progress with Iran on past nuclear activities , the country had not responded properly to intelligence forwarded by the US and its allies purportedly showing nuclear weapons technology being developed by Iran .
The head of the IAEA , Mohamed ElBaradei , last week said Iran 's denials on the development of nuclear weapons were not good enough and he confirmed that Iran was pursuing , and even expanding , its uranium enrichment , in violation of UN demands ."
2008-03-03,"At least 23 people were killed and more than 50 wounded when two bombs exploded in Baghdad today .
The attacks came despite increased security measures being put in place across the Iraqi capital prior to a visit by the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
In the deadliest , 21 people , including a police officer , were killed and 43 injured when an Iraqi army patrol was hit by a car bomb in the central Bab al - Muadham area , police said .
Another four were killed when a suicide car bomber rammed an army checkpoint at Ghadeer , in the east of the city .
Two soldiers were among the dead , and the blast destroyed three houses and injured a further 10 people .
Earlier , a roadside bomb in northern Baghdad wounded three civilians , police said .
Ahmadinejad 's visit is the first of its kind by a leader from the region since the US - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
It is the first by an Iranian leader since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
There was no immediate indication of who was responsible for today 's bombings or whether they were directly linked to the visit .
Yesterday , US soldiers discovered 14 bodies - all thought to have been members of the Iraqi security forces - in a mass grave around 60 miles north of Baghdad .
Officials said the victims had their hands tied behind their backs and had been shot in the head ."
2008-03-03,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the Iranian president , pledged a new chapter in relations with Iraq yesterday as he ignored the huge US military presence in the country and arrived to a red - carpet welcome in Baghdad on the first visit of its kind since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
Symbolically , it was also the first fully fledged state visit to Iraq by any foreign head of state since the US - led coalition overthrew Saddam Hussein 's Ba'ath dictatorship in 2003 .
Ahmadinejad held hands with his Iraqi counterpart , Jalal Talabani , as their national anthems were played , underlining Iran 's regional clout and influence with the Shia - dominated Baghdad government , many of whose leaders lived in exile in Tehran during the Saddam era .
"" This visit will open a new chapter ... and it will help the atmosphere of cooperation in the region , "" declared Ahmadinejad .
"" A visit to Iraq without the dictator is a truly happy one . ""
Talabani , a Kurd who speaks fluent Farsi , spoke of a "" new era "" of friendship between the two countries , which fought a war that cost a million lives from 1980 to 1988 .
Ahmadinejad 's visit is seen as a calculated snub to the US , which regularly accuses Iran of backing Iraqi Shia militias , as well as seeking to develop nuclear weapons and supporting terrorism elsewhere in the Middle East .
But Ahmadinejad was defiant : "" We tell Mr Bush that accusing others without evidence will increase the problems in the region , "" he said at a news conference with the prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki , in the US - guarded Green Zone in Baghdad .
"" Iran has no need to intervene in Iraq , "" he retorted on Saturday .
"" It is friendly to all groups in Iraq .
Is n't it ridiculous that those who have deployed 160,000 troops in Iraq accuse us of intervening there ? ""
Unlike Iran , Arab countries which sympathise with Iraq 's Sunni minority have been reluctant to open fully fledged embassies in Baghdad .
Vice - president Tareq al - Hashemi , a Sunni , was conspicuously absent from the arrival ceremony .
Heavy security was in place as Ahmadinejad 's motorcade took the Baghdad airport road to Talabani 's palace , eschewing the safer helicopter trip usually taken by other visiting dignitaries .
The contrast with the US was painfully obvious .
The last time Bush visited Iraq he stayed a few hours at a remote airbase in western Anbar province , flying in unannounced to avoid insurgent attacks .
Western analysts believe Iran wants a stable Iraq but at the same time wants to make life difficult for US forces .
Expert opinion is divided over its role in persuading Moqtada al - Sadr 's Mahdi army to call two ceasefires , which have helped reduce violence during the US troop "" surge "" .
Politics apart , Iran is also advertising its growing trade and economic ties to Iraq , especially loans for infrastructure projects .
Millions of Iranian pilgrims now travel to the Shia shrines in Iraq , and Iran is building an airport for pilgrims to fly directly to Najaf and Karbala ."
2008-03-04,"· Just what has Britain ever done for us , bewildered Iraqis ask as Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad continues his tour - or is it a recce - in their country ?
It 's a fair question .
MPs have been asking it too .
What military equipment have we gifted Iraqi security forces since 2003 , asked MP Nick Harvey , and the Ministry of Defence gave him the list : 2005 's highlights include 6,500 AK47 assault rifles , 5.3 m rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition , 25,058 sets of body armour , 5,666 9 mm pistols , 438 underslung grenade launchers and 774 light machine guns .
In 2006 we gave the Iraqis more useful stuff , including 90 Dshka 12.7 mm heavy machine guns , 6,300 more 9 mm pistols , 85 medium machine guns , 12 Dragunov sniper rifles - and , to help with security at Basra Palace , 300 of our best hand grenades .
We are equipping them to blast the place apart but also to put it back together .
The ying and yang of nation building .
Ahmadinejad , beat that ! ·
And this is how we will beat global warming .
No fuss .
No panic .
Phil Woolas is one of those in charge .
The government already has a commitment to a 60 % cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
Experts are virtually united in saying that this is not enough , and that the figure should be closer to 80 % .
But Woolas , speaking to the Institute of Economic Affairs and Marketforce - and riding , some say , a carbon - efficient coach and horses through the government 's strategy thus far - says we should not get too exercised about this .
There is a limit to the effect we can have .
Worldwide agreements are the most pressing thing .
"" I find the debate whether it 's 60 or 80 % an intellectually bankrupt argument , "" said the minister of state for the environment .
""
Sixty or 80 % of what ? ""
And if he does n't know , we ca n't tell him . ·
But then we do approve of plain speaking .
Another government honcho we like is Lord West of Spithead , the undersecretary of state ( security and counter - terrorism ) who was asked by the Earl of Onslow to share what is known about those who have absconded from terrorism control orders .
"" My Lords , so far as I am aware , we have no information whatever about them , "" he said .
Candid , clueless , admirable . · Steve Wright , the depraved killer of at least five Ipswich prostitutes , is many things , but one thing he is not is the Bishop of Norwich .
Good then
, that the Eastern Daily Press , which managed to caption the bishop 's picture thus yesterday , realised its mistake , apologised and quickly handed a donation to the Magdalene Group , which works with sex workers in the town .
So easy to cause misunderstanding . ·
So HSBC has written off £ 8.7bn .
But it 's "" the world 's local bank "" .
How could it do so badly ?
Well last week we mentioned its unfortunate habit of leaving branch doors open
overnight - there were three occurrences in two weeks .
That could be part of the answer .
One of the incidents occurred in the Suffolk town of Sudbury , where newsagent Alan Devereux found the doors wide open .
By some miracle nothing had been taken .
He stood guard until the authorities arrived .
Amazingly public - spirited , thought the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Phillips of Sudbury .
What thanks have you had from the bank , he asked Mr Devereux days later ?
I 've heard nothing from them , Mr Devereux said .
Why do n't you write to the newsagent , Lord Phillips then inquired of the branch manager .
I ca n't , it has to come from head office , she replied .
The bank has since sought to retrieve the situation by sending its saviour a bunch of flowers .
But if this is how its processes work , is it any wonder things are bad ? ·
And then to Prince Harry , who has taken to calling himself Spike Wells to conceal the depth and breadth of his cyber - conversations with his young lady Chelsea .
For the most part this is charming , but if you were the real Spike Wells , a top British jazz drummer still playing the pubs and clubs and festivals , might you not call it ID fraud ?
Poor Harry , feted one moment , pursued by the authorities the next .

2008-03-16,"Religious conservatives in Iran - who had been guaranteed a strong showing in the country 's new parliament following the barring of many Reformist candidates from standing in Friday 's elections - appeared last night to have secured up to 70 per cent of seats .
Despite the strong inherent bias towards the conservatives - or ' Principalists ' - who had vowed to protect the values of the country 's Islamic revolution , some of those conservatives also included strong critics of the leadership of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Critics , including some among the Basij militia which supported his election as president , say Ahmadinejad has failed in efforts to fix the economy of this oil - rich nation .
They blame him for high inflation , surging unemployment and fuel shortages .
They also blame him for the worsening stand - off with the West , bringing UN sanctions over Iran 's nuclear programme .
In the 115 of parliament 's 290 seats decided so far , pro - Ahmadinejad hard - liners won 42 seats and Reformists 16 , according to results announced by state television and the official news agency Irna and reports from local officials .
A slate of conservative critics of Ahmadinejad had seized 28 seats so far .
Another 29 winners were independents whose political leanings were not immediately known .
Reformists were hoping at least to form a minority bloc larger than their approximately 40 seats in the outgoing parliament .
But the results so far pointed to how deeply the movement was hurt when Iran 's hardline clerical leadership threw many of its candidates out of the race .
Before Friday 's voting , the unelected Guardian Council used its powers to disqualify 1,700 candidates on grounds of insufficient loyalty to Islam or Iran 's 1979 revolution .
As a result , Reformist candidates were running in only about half of the races nationwide and many of them were little known to the public .
The results so far did not include Tehran , where reformist sentiment is strongest .
More than 65 per cent of Iran 's 44 million eligible voters cast ballots on Friday , Interior Ministry spokesman Hasan Khanlou said .
That was up from 51 per cent in the 2004 election when hardliners took parliament from Reformists , after many liberals were barred from running .
Before the vote , supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei - who has the final say in all state matters - appeared to give his support to the Ahmadinejad camp . '
The next parliament will definitely be more critical of Ahmadinejad and they will try to expose him more , ' said an Iranian political analyst , who did not wish to be named .
The analyst said splits had opened up among conservatives jockeying for position before the 2009 race for the presidency .
While no official results were available , the semi - official Fars news agency said early indications showed more than 70 per cent of seats had gone to ' Principalist ' candidates .
Challenges to Ahmadinejad might emerge even from a conservative - led assembly as politicians manoeuvre before next year 's presidential vote and home in on his economic policies .
which are blamed for inflation , the biggest gripe for ordinary Iranians .
Fars said Ali Larijani , a conservative seen as a potential rival to Ahmadinejad , had won 76 per cent of the vote in his Qom constituency south of Tehran ."
2008-03-17,"Religious conservatives yesterday claimed victory in Iranian parliamentary elections , deepening the divide between Tehran and the west .
With just over half the seats decided last night , official reports said that supporters of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and other hardliners had won 120 , against 46 for their reformist challengers , who had been barred from standing in many constituencies .
Tehran 's 30 seats had not been declared , but conservatives were also claiming to have won a clear majority in the capital .
The Iranian leadership portrayed the vote as an act of popular defiance in the face of international sanctions over the country 's nuclear programme .
The possibility that Iran might suspend its enrichment of uranium , in line with UN security council demands is now negligible , Iranian political analysts said .
The EU presidency issued a statement yesterday expressing "" its deep regret and disappointment that over a third of prospective candidates were prevented from standing in [ the ] elections .
As a result , the election was neither fair nor free .
"" Iran 's interior ministry said the turnout had been 60 % , although some opposition members and political observers expressed scepticism .
Many polling stations witnessed just a steady trickle of voters during Friday 's vote .
Ahmadinejad is now well positioned for next year 's presidential elections .
He is expected to tighten his grip on the media further , with the support of Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who is constitutionally supposed to be above party politics , but who dropped any vestige of impartiality to praise the president in the last days of the election campaign ."
2008-03-29,"It 's become quite fashionable for journalists to report on the diminishing popularity of the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ( for example in the Independent , the Herald Tribune and the New York Times ) , especially focusing on the consequences of his economic policies , which were seen as one of the main reasons he was elected .
But facts on the ground suggest Ahmadinejad is as popular as ever .
Indeed , his allies have won six consecutive elections in the past six years : the Tehran council 's election in 2002 when all big figures of the reformist parties were allowed to run ; the controversial parliament elections in 2003 which , one has to admit , was not competitive due to the disqualification of many reformists ; the presidential elections in 2005 with the presence of three strong reformist rivals ; the city council 's elections in 2006 where reformists were again allowed to compete but won a small percentage of seats ; the recent parliament elections , with strong rivals from both his former allies and also reformists .
One may argue that these results are not truly representative , but how about the results of a recent American survey by Terror Free Tomorrow , a non - partisan research organisation that boasts John McCain , Lee H Hamilton , William H Frist , and Thomas H Kean on its board ?
Satisfaction with Ahmadinejad 's economic policies , the poll results show , has nearly doubled since last June :
42 % now think that "" economy is headed toward the right direction "" , up from 27 % last June .
Even in terms of inflation and unemployment , more Iranians now think Ahmadinejad 's government is doing a good job , and 42 % now think his policies "" have succeeded in reducing unemployment and inflation "" , whereas in June only 33 % thought so .
The most striking aspect of the anti - Ahmadinejad reporting is that the Iranian economic experts who are usually quoted are not only close allies of Ahmadinejad 's rivals , such as former president Akbar Hashemi , but also differ deeply in their free - market , minimal government approach to power .
Ironically , one critic , Saeed Leylaz , editor of a financial daily newspaper called Capital , or Sarmayeh .
Laylaz also happen to have been an economic adviser to Rafsanjani .
Which should we believe - journalists or elections and polls - when they are drawing such different conclusions ?
Is there a chance that journalists are falling into a trap laid by politicians , who are turning their hopes into facts ?"
2008-04-08,"Iran has begun installing 6,000 new centrifuges at its uranium enrichment plant in Natanz , the country 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , announced on state television today .
Centrifuges are machines used to enrich uranium , either to a low level to produce nuclear fuel or to a high level for use in a weapon .
Iran already has about 3,000 centrifuges at Natanz and news of the expansion will be seen as a further snub to the US and its allies , who allege the country 's uranium enrichment programme is a cover for building nuclear weapons .
It is not clear what kind of centrifuges are being installed in Natanz .
More advanced centrifuges can enrich uranium at a much faster rate .
Iran says it needs to boost its domestic energy supply and is simply exercising its right to enrich fuel for nuclear power under the Nuclear Non - Proliferation treaty .
The UN security council imposed a third round of sanctions , targeting the nuclear and military sectors , on Iran last month ."
2008-04-14,"The head of Iran 's nuclear programme has cancelled a meeting scheduled for today with the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
Gholam Reza Aghazadeh , the Iranian vice - president , gave no reason for calling off talks with Mohamed ElBaradei , who was expected to use the meeting to investigate claims that Tehran had attempted to develop nuclear weapons .
Diplomats said the meeting was likely to have dealt with last week 's announcement by the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , of a major expansion of the country 's capacity for uranium enrichment , in defiance of UN security council demands .
The talks were seen as a test of Iran 's willingness to cooperate with the IAEA 's demands for greater openness surrounding what Tehran maintains is a civilian nuclear programme .
Iran is under three sets of security council sanctions for its refusal to comply .
Last week , Ahmadinejad announced the installation of 6,000 new centrifuges – central to the process of uranium enrichment – which would double Iran 's current capacity .
He said a new model , which was five times faster than current equipment , was being tested .
The US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , said the claim could not immediately be substantiated .
Diplomats close to the IAEA said Iran had suffered problems operating existing centrifuges and was exaggerating its progress .
One diplomat said Ahmadinejad 's claims alluded to a centrifuge known as the IR-2 , which the agency admitted Tehran had begun testing months ago .
It is believed to be up to three times faster than Iran 's existing centrifuges .
Iran claims to be planning an expansion of its uranium enrichment to 54,000 centrifuges , and maintains its only interest in the process is to provide nuclear fuel for electricity generation .
US intelligence agencies say Tehran was developing nuclear weapons until at least 2003 , and reports to the IAEA 's 35-nation board have detailed a number of allegations .
These include the linking of uranium conversion to the testing of high explosives , the design of a missile re - entry vehicle , and Iran 's possession of a 15-page document on forming uranium metal into the shape of a warhead ."
2008-04-16,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has intervened on behalf of the country 's leading human rights campaigner , the Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi , by ordering police to investigate death threats made against her and give her protection .
The move came after Ebadi , a lawyer and frequent critic of the government 's human rights record , released details of a recent spate of threats , claiming that police had failed to respond to her complaints .
Ebadi , 60 , who was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2003 , said a note had been left at the door of her office which read : "" Shirin Ebadi , your death is near . ""
One letter threatened to kill her daughter and accused Ebadi of having links to the Bahais , a minority religious sect regarded as heretics by the Iranian authorities .
"" We told you to give up your un - Islamic and Bahai - based faith , but you have continued serving the foreigners and the Bahais , and even your daughter is involved .
So we will kill her , so you understand , "" the hand - written note allegedly read .
Another , pinned to the door of her office , told Ebadi to "" watch your tongue ... or you will be avenged "" , she said .
Some threats also warned her against making speeches abroad .
Colleagues of Ebadi said she ordered the letters to be released while on a three - week lecture tour of the US , after police did not follow up her reports .
In an accompanying statement she said : "" The threat against my family and I has recently intensified .
Those who wish me dead do not have any personal animosity .
They are those who are against my ideas , so finding the person or people who sent me the threatening letters is not a difficult task . ""
The resulting publicity appears to have embarrassed Ahmadinejad , who is not noted for his pro - human rights sentiments and whom campaigners have accused of overseeing a systematic crackdown on opponents and dissidents .
"" It is the police 's duty to preserve the security and safety of all Iranian citizens , "" state radio quoted him as saying .
"" The issue should be investigated and violators should be handed over to the judiciary .
"" Ebadi has complained in the past of death threats and official harassment aimed at intimidating her from acting for defendants who have fallen foul of the regime .
In her memoir Iran Awakening , published in 2006 , she describes investigating the murder of two dissidents and discovering the transcript of a conversation in which a minister is quoted as telling a member of an officially - backed death squad : "" The next person to be killed is Shirin Ebadi . ""
Her relations with the authorities were strained further after she agreed to act for Haleh Esfandiari , a detained Iranian - born US academic who was accused of acting against national security .
Esfandiari was later bailed and allowed to leave Iran ."
2008-04-28,"Napoleon is said to have observed that geography is destiny .
Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , will be emphasising the truth of the emperor of France 's words in the next two days as he makes surprise appearances in Pakistan and India .
The president 's visits will last just a few hours and are likely to set in train big changes for the region .
Sensing that the clock is ticking for the Bush administration , Iran wants to press ahead with a long - proposed 1,700-mile pipeline to deliver gas to Pakistan and India , at a cost $ 7.5bn .
Buying oil and gas is never just about cash ; the deals are political acts .
Understanding that such a project would see a shared strategic interest develop between three nations straddling the world 's main oil and gas artery , the US has been chipping away at it for the past two years .
Washington instead peddles a rival scheme : the $ 7.6bn gas pipeline from Turkmenistan 's Dauletabad field through Herat and Kandahar in Afghanistan to Multan in Pakistan , and finally into India .
Both may go ahead but it is Iran 's proposal that has momentum .
Oil ministers met in Islamabad last week and agreed to sign a bilateral agreement and to start construction of the pipeline by 2010 .
India also wants to put back on track a floundering $ 25bn deal for getting 5 million tonnes of liquefied gas from Iran every year for the next 25 years .
In recent months , it has become increasingly clear that the US has been unable to crack the Persian puzzle .
The Byzantine world of Iranian politics , heavily influenced by the Islamic republic 's Shia clergy , has proved more than a match for the apparently blundering Americans .
The US 's attempts to ostracise Iran over its nuclear programme have so far yielded little .
Washington 's sanctions strategy has also been undone , principally by China 's announcement that it would develop oil and gas fields in southwestern Iran for $ 2bn late last year .
None of this has gone unnoticed in Delhi and Islamabad .
Pakistan has had a fractious relationship with Iran in recent years , partly due to Islamabad promoting Sunni revivalist cults that have attacked Shias .
Pakistan also has close links to Saudi Arabia , Iran 's rival in the middle east .
India 's dealings with Iran have been bedevilled by baubles dangled by the US : principally a deal that would legitimate Delhi as a nuclear - weapons power in return for the inspection of civilian atomic energy plants .
So far the deal has been blocked by Indian communists and the Hindu nationalist opposition to score political points at home .
But this has not soothed Iran .
To Tehran 's annoyance , India voted with the US and against Iran 's nuclear programme twice - in October 2005 and February 2006 - at the International Atomic Energy Agency .
The Indians are likely to be seeking to make amends with President Ahmadinejad in a big way .
Nukes have long been at the centre of Iranian dealings with south Asia .
Ever since Iraq used chemical weapons on Iran and the world stood by and watched , Tehran has hankered for the ultimate deterrent : atomic weapons .
Pakistan 's A Q Khan famously sold Iran nuclear know - how .
Delhi , too , has dabbled .
The US successfully lobbied to end a deal signed in 1991 between India and Iran for the supply of a 10-megawatt research reactor .
India has never shared Washington 's assessments of Iran as an aggressive regional power .
In 2003 , Delhi feted the country 's last president and signed a "" strategic partnership "" with Tehran .
The Iranian navy has undergone training with its Indian counterpart and New Delhi and Tehran have agreed to "" join hands "" in the reconstruction of Afghanistan .
India 's reason is simple : my neighbour 's neighbour is my friend .
Hence it sees Iran as offering a road to central Asia - a key Indian concern - that bypasses Pakistan .
To this end New Delhi has been building up Iran 's Chahbahar port and constructing roads that skirt Pakistan 's border .
India and Iran 's energy , strategic and diplomatic ties , likely to be revived this week , may also see more private sector dealings between the two nations .
In the past this has led to revelations of Indian transfers to Iran of high - technology goods that could be useful for Iran 's atomic programme .
These transactions appear not to be part of Indian government policy but spin - off deals between companies .
In 2004 , the US slapped sanctions on two former former heads of India 's nuclear power corporation who allegedly passed to Iran nuclear technology .
The truth is that in the past few months , Tehran has emerged as the Gulf 's main power centre .
In Iraq , Tehran has outfoxed competitors , gaining influence at their expense .
Iran 's intervention a few weeks ago to end a bloody Shia conflict on the banks of Iraq 's Tigris did not go unnoticed in Washington .
In Afghanistan both Indian and Pakistani diplomats have noted that the west 's position is becoming seriously eroded , leaving Iran to shape the debate .
This means they have to take seriously President Ahmadinejad 's recent questioning of Nato 's legitimacy in Afghanistan .
There is also a feeling that the western alliance has become lopsided : the US has accepted it will need to airlift more troops because the Europeans will not .
If America ends up as the sole defender of the Kabul regime then the attacks on the "" coalition "" can be construed as a resistance army fighting an occupier .
All this comes at a time when the Northern Alliance , the former rebels in Kabul over which Iran has considerable influence , have been talking to their arch - rivals the Taliban , something that is anathema to Washington .
However much the Americans might wish otherwise , the reality is that no one can ignore Iran .
Involved in bloody imbroglios in Afghan and Iraq , Tehran calculates the US would not use force against Iran , even if it pursues its nuclear ambitions .
To reinforce this point Iran recently announced that 6,000 new advanced centrifuges were up and running at the Natanz uranium enrichment facility .
President Ahmadinejad plainly enjoys the taunting the US .
This is an Iranian luxury , afforded by geography and geology , that neither India and Pakistan have ."
2008-05-15,"President George Bush used a visit to Israel today to denounce Democratic offers to negotiate with America 's enemies in the Middle East as comparable to appeasement of Hitler .
Although Bush did not name any Democrat , Barack Obama has offered to open negotiations with the Iranian leader , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and with the Syrian president , Bashar Assad .
Obama and other Democratic leaders expressed outrage at the comparison with Nazis , especially during a visit to Israel .
They also condemned he president for breaking a long - time convention against using foreign visits to make domestic political points .
Obama described it as a "" false political attack "" , saying he had never advocated talking to terrorists , while Joe Biden , Democratic chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee , said : "" This is bullshit . ""
The Democratic leader of the House , Nancy Pelosi , described Bush 's comments as "" beneath the dignity of his office "" .
Speaking during a visit to the Knesset , where he was attending celebrations to mark Israel 's 60th anniversary , Bush said it was a foolish delusion to think it was possible to negotiate with extremists and terrorists . ""
As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939 , an American senator declared : ' Lord , if only I could have talked to Hitler , all of this might have been avoided . '
We have an obligation to call this what it is - the false comfort of appeasement , which has been repeatedly discredited by history .
"" Bush did not say whether he was referring to Obama 's offer to meet the Ahmadinejad or former president Jimmy Carter 's meeting with Hamas .
The White House spokeswoman , Dana Perino , denied that it was directed at Obama but , asked if the president 's comments included Obama , she said that was for Bush to answer .
Obama 's campaign team accused Bush of abusing his office to help the Republican White House candidate , John McCain .
McCain , in a conference call with bloggers , used similarly emotional language as Bush and repeatedly accused Obama of being naive in his willingness to negotiate with the Iranian leadership . ""
If Senator Obama wants to sit down across the table from a country that calls Israel a stinking corpse and comes to New York and says he wants to wipe Israel off the map , what is it that he wants to talk about with them . ""
McCain said .
Earlier , McCain bowed to anti - war sentiment by setting a date for withdrawal of US forces from Iraq in 2013 in an attempt to boost his chances of winning the White House .
The withdrawal date marked a U - turn for McCain , who had based his run for the White House on his willingness to keep US forces in Iraq for up to 100 years .
McCain 's setting of a date for withdrawal came in spite of having berated his Democratic rivals for the last 12 months for demanding a firm withdrawal date from Iraq , saying it would lead to chaos and genocide .
But McCain 's strong support for keeping US troops in Iraq was proving costly for his campaign , with feelings against the war running as high as 63 % in a USA Today - Gallup poll last month .
Obama has promised to have most US troops out of Iraq by December next year .
McCain rolled out his new vision for Iraq in a speech in the swing state of Ohio .
He anticipated that by January 2013 , "" America has welcomed home most of the servicemen and women who have sacrificed terribly so that America might be secure in her freedom . ""
The Iraq war has been won .
Iraq is a functioning democracy , although still suffering from the lingering effects of decades of tyranny and centuries of sectarian tension .
Violence still occurs , but it is spasmodic and much reduced . ""
The address was part of a concerted effort by McCain to win over independent and moderate Democratic voters by distancing himself from the unpopular policies of Bush .
Republican fears that they could lose both the White House and Congress in November rose on Tuesday when they were defeated in a previously safe congressional seat in Mississippi . ""
John McCain will not be elected on Republican votes alone .
He is going to have to defeat Obama decisively with independent voters as well , which is why he is beginning to talk about a date certain for withdrawal , "" said Frank Luntz , a Republican strategist who has warned his party they face disaster next November .
Judith Kipper , a Middle East specialist at the Washington - based Institute of World Affairs , said that McCain 's reference to 100 years in Iraq was a "" phrase that is going to haunt him throughout the campaign "" and said that his speech yesterday was designed to provide a position that was more acceptable to the electorate ."

Obama described it as a "" false political attack "" , saying he had never advocated talking to terrorists , while Joe Biden , the Democratic chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee , said : "" This is bullshit . ""
The Democratic leader of the House of Representatives , Nancy Pelosi , described Bush 's comments as "" beneath the dignity of his office "" .
Speaking during a visit to the Knesset , where he was attending celebrations to mark Israel 's 60th anniversary , Bush said it was a foolish delusion to think it was possible to negotiate with extremists and terrorists . ""
As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939 , an American senator declared : ' Lord , if only I could have talked to Hitler , all of this might have been avoided , ' "" Bush said .
He added : "" We have an obligation to call this what it is - the false comfort of appeasement , which has been repeatedly discredited by history . ""
The president did not say whether he was referring to Obama 's offer to meet Ahmadinejad or to former president Jimmy Carter 's meeting with Hamas .
The White House press spokeswoman , Dana Perino , denied that the comments were directed at Obama .
Obama 's campaign team accused Bush of abusing his office to help the Republican White House candidate , John McCain .
McCain , in a conference call with bloggers , used similarly emotional language as Bush and repeatedly accused Obama of being naive in his willingness to negotiate with the Iranian leadership . ""
If Senator Obama wants to sit down across the table from a country that calls Israel a stinking corpse and [ whose president ] comes to New York and says he wants to wipe Israel off the map , what is it that he wants to talk about with them ? ""
McCain asked .
Earlier , McCain bowed to anti - war sentiment by setting 2013 as the date for withdrawal of US forces from Iraq , in an attempt to boost his chances of winning the White House .
He said he expected the war to be over by that date .
The comment marked a U - turn for McCain , who had based his run for the White House on his willingness to keep US forces in Iraq for up to 100 years .
McCain 's retreat came despite having berated his Democratic rivals for the last 12 months for demanding a firm withdrawal date from Iraq , saying it would lead to chaos and genocide .
But his strong support for keeping US troops in Iraq has proved costly for his campaign , with feelings against the war running as high as 63 % in a USA Today - Gallup poll last month .
Obama has promised to have most troops out of Iraq by December 2009 .
McCain rolled out his new vision for Iraq in a speech in the swing state of Ohio .
He anticipated that by January 2013 "" America has welcomed home most of the servicemen and women who have sacrificed terribly so that America might be secure . ""
The Iraq war has been won .
Iraq is a functioning democracy , although still suffering from the lingering effects of decades of tyranny and centuries of sectarian tension .
Violence still occurs , but it is spasmodic and much reduced . ""
The address was part of a concerted effort by the presumptive Republican nominee to win over independent and moderate Democratic voters by distancing himself from Bush 's unpopular policies .
Republican fears that they could lose both the White House and Congress in the November election increased on Tuesday when they lost a previously safe congressional seat in Mississippi .
Frank Luntz , a Republican strategist who has warned that the party faces disaster in November , said : "" John McCain will not be elected on Republican votes alone .
He is going to have to defeat Obama with independent voters as well , which is why he is beginning to talk about a date certain for withdrawal . ""
Judith Kipper , a Middle East specialist at the Washington - based Institute of World Affairs , said that McCain 's reference to 100 years in Iraq was a "" phrase that is going to haunt him throughout the campaign "" , and that his speech yesterday was designed to provide a position that was more acceptable to the electorate ."
2008-05-21,"Barack Obama has begun to edge away from his offer to pursue talks with Iran 's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad after being hammered by Republicans as an "" appeaser "" .
Now on the cusp of securing the Democratic nomination , Obama yesterday continued to attack John McCain , his likely Republican opponent in November , over his hawkish foreign policy . ""
He has spent his last week describing his foreign policy as who he wo n't talk to , "" Obama told a rally in Florida yesterday .
After Tuesday 's primaries , in which Obama lost badly to Hillary Clinton in Kentucky but won well in Oregon , he is now just 65 delegates away from the Democratic nomination .
But with the November election in his sights , Obama backed away from his promise last year to meet Ahmadinejad without preconditions during his first year in the White House .
His campaign has stopped mentioning Ahmadinejad by name , and noting that there must be "" preparations "" for such an encounter . ""
He wants to talk to the Iranian leadership , "" Bill Richardson , the New Mexico governor and Obama supporter told Fox television yesterday . ""
But he wants diplomatic preparation before doing that .
"" On Tuesday , Obama 's foreign policy adviser , Susan Rice , told CNN that he did not necessarily mean he would meet Ahmadinejad when he offered to open talks with Iran . ""
He has n't named who that leader will be , "" she said .
"" It may , in fact be that by the middle of next year , Ahmadinejad is long gone . ""
The emerging position is much more guarded than Obama 's pledge during a YouTube debate last July to meet the leaders of Iran , Syria , Venezuela , Cuba and North Korea without preconditions during his first year in the White House .
It comes as Obama diverts his energies from the three remaining Democratic primary contests - in Puerto Rico , South Dakota and Montana- to building up the coalitions he needs to win key swing states .
Obama 's three - day tour of Florida followed Tuesday 's primaries .
Clinton thrashed Obama in Kentucky , taking 65 % of the vote against Obama 's 30 % .
But the senator for Illinois racked up a big win in Oregon , with 58 % of the vote against 42 % for Clinton .
Obama and Clinton did not campaign in Florida whose primary contest , along with Michigan 's , was held in defiance of the Democratic national committee .
Day one of the Florida tour was aimed at winning over Obama 's most reliable supporters - African - American voters as well as young people - and reaching out to constituencies he will need to take the state : Orlando 's Puerto Rican community as well as Jewish and elderly voters .
Obama is scheduled to meet Cuban - American exiles on Friday , considered the most faithful Republican supporters .
He is now poised to embark on a rigorous campaign tour through battleground states to win over the white working - class voters who so far have backed Clinton .
His campaign is also rolling out a voter registration drive to increase the turnout among African - Americans who have voted overwhelmingly for Obama as well as secondary school students who are about to turn 18 and will be voting for the first time ."
2008-05-28,"The Iranian parliament has elected the country 's former chief nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani as its speaker .
Larijani , a conservative heavyweight who is seen as a potential rival to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , quit his position last year due to his differences with the president over how to handle the nuclear row with the west .
He has often been critical of Ahmadinejad , who beat him in the 2005 presidential election .
Minutes after becoming speaker today , Larijani told parliament that a new report by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) was "" deplorable "" .
The harsh report , issued on Monday , said Iran might be withholding information needed to establish whether it tried to make nuclear weapons . ""
Should this behaviour continue , the parliament will set new limits on cooperation with the IAEA , "" said Larijani .
His comments drew chants of "" God is great "" and "" death to America "" from the chamber .
The UN security council has imposed three sets of sanctions against Iran for its refusal to stop the enrichment of uranium , a process that can be used to generate electricity or make nuclear arms .
Iran , one of the world 's biggest oil exporters , says the enrichment is aimed at generating power not building nuclear weapons .
The position of parliamentary speaker gives much power to Larijani , whose previous posts include state broadcasting chief and culture minister .
Larijani won 232 votes out of a total of 263 cast in parliament , Iranian news agencies reported ."
2008-06-04,"Aside from the small matter of the world food crisis , the United Nations summit in Rome this week has been dominated by the appearance of two controversial national leaders .
First , Robert Mugabe arrived and used the opportunity to defend his land reforms , which are widely regarded as having crippled Zimbabwe 's agricultural industry , and to deliver a stinging riposte to the UK government and other critics for trying to force "" illegal regime change "" by their condemnation of his rule .
Then , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran treated the assembled world 's media to a trademark diatribe against the "" devilish motivations "" of the west , whose greed he castigated as responsible for the food crisis ; he went on to predict the demise of Israel , describing it as a "" fabricated entity ... doomed to go "" .
The presence of these two heads of states who , albeit for different reasons , are regarded by many other members of the international community as , at best , persona non grata and , at worst , pariahs has comprehensively upstaged the intended focus of the summit .
So when , this morning on the BBC 's Today programme , the journalist and writer Adam LeBor , argued that the UN should be willing and able to expel members whose record on human rights makes them "" rogue states "" , he may have struck a chord .
So , should the remit of the United Nations extend to this kind of moral policing of its membership ?
And if so , how should such measures be determined - by the security council or by the general assembly ?
And by simple majority vote or some higher threshold ?
And what would be achieved if countries such as Zimbabwe or Iran were suspended or expelled from the UN ?"
2008-06-06,"An Israeli minister has said an attack on Iran 's nuclear sites will be "" unavoidable "" if Tehran refuses to halt its alleged weapons programme .
In the most explicit threat yet by a member of Ehud Olmert 's government , Shaul Mofaz , a deputy prime minister , said the hardline Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , "" would disappear before Israel does "" .
"" If Iran continues with its programme for developing nuclear weapons , we will attack it .
The sanctions are ineffective , "" Mofaz , who is also Israel 's transport minister , said in comments published today by the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper .
"" Attacking Iran in order to stop its nuclear plans will be unavoidable . ""
Iranian - born Mofaz is a former army chief and defence minister .
He is a member of Olmert 's security cabinet and leads regular strategic coordination talks with the US state department .
Iran denies trying to build nuclear weapons and has defied western pressure to abandon uranium enrichment .
The leadership in Tehran has threatened that if attacked the country will retaliate against Israel - believed to have the Middle East 's only nuclear arsenal - and American targets in the region .
Ahmadinejad has repeatedly called for Israel to be wiped off the map since becoming president .
On Monday , he said Israel was "" about to die and will soon be erased from the geographical scene "" .
Olmert met the US president , George Bush , on Wednesday to discuss concerns over Iran .
The Israeli prime minister , who is being pressured to resign over a corruption scandal , has said that Iran 's nuclear threat "" must be stopped by all possible means "" .
Israeli planes bombed Syria in September , destroying what the US administration said was a partly built nuclear reactor using North Korean help .
Syria denied having any such facility .
UN inspectors announced this week that they would be visiting Syria to investigate the American claim ."
2008-06-11,"The US president , George Bush , raised the possibility today of military action against Iran , saying his first choice was for a diplomatic solution to the standoff over Tehran 's nuclear programme , but that "" all options are on the table "" .
The prospects of a diplomatic breakthrough looked slim , however , with Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , labelling his US counterpart a "" wicked man "" whose policies had failed .
Bush 's comments came a day after a US - EU summit in Slovenia threatened new sanctions against Iran if it fails to end its uranium enrichment programme .
He was speaking after talks with the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , who appeared to support the US view .
"" The first choice is to solve it diplomatically and that 's exactly what we 're doing , "" Bush told reporters in Meseberg , a German government rural retreat north of Berlin . ""
The message to the Iranian government is very clear .
"" Germany is Bush 's second stop on a final visit to Europe before he steps down as president .
He wants Iran to halt uranium enrichment in a verifiable way , claiming the nuclear material is intended for atomic weapons .
Iran insists its nuclear programme is for purely civil purposes .
Merkel , a strong US ally , reiterated Germany 's support for possible new sanctions against Iran if it does not suspend enrichment . ""
The offer has been put to Iran , but ... if Iran does not meet its commitments , then further sanctions will have to follow , "" she said .
"" We again said we want to give diplomacy a chance , but we also have to stay on that particular issue . ""
The two leaders also discussed climate change , Afghanistan , rising food prices and the tortuous progress of World Trade Organisation talks .
Bush is in Rome tomorrow for talks with the Italian prime minister , Silvio Berlusconi , ahead of a meeting the next day with Pope Benedict XVI .
After a stopover for more talks in Paris he heads to London on Sunday followed by Belfast .
With Bush 's presidency winding down rapidly before he leaves office in January the trip has attracted relatively little media interest and – unlike previous occasions he has been in Europe – almost no protests .
Addressing a crowd in the central Iranian city of Shahr - e - Kord , Ahmadinejad mocked Bush as a lame duck leader whose time "" has come to an end "" . ""
This wicked man desires to harm the Iranian nation , "" he said .
"" [ Bush ] made plans , moved into Afghanistan and then Iraq , and announced that Iran was the third target .
"" I tell him your era has come to an end .
With the grace of God , you wo n't be able to harm even one centimetre of the sacred land of Iran .
"" Iran would remain implacable against international pressure , he insisted .
"" If the enemy thinks they can break the Iranian nation with pressure , they are wrong .
With God 's help , we have achieved victory and the enemies can not do a damned thing . """
2008-06-15,"A nuclear deal proposed by the major powers appeared yesterday to have widened rifts among Iran 's ruling conservatives but seemed unlikely to lead to a quick diplomatic breakthrough .
The proposal , made by the five permanent members of the UN security council as well as Germany , and made public yesterday , offered help building "" light water "" reactors , the "" provision of legally binding nuclear fuel supply guarantees , cooperation with regard to management of spent fuel and radioactive waste "" in return for Iran 's suspension of uranium enrichment and reprocessing .
A spokesman for the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , rejected the conditions as "" unacceptable "" and "" not debatable at all "" .
President George Bush said the Iranian government had "" rejected this generous offer out of hand "" .
However , Tehran has made no formal response to the package , which was delivered by the EU foreign policy chief , Javier Solana and a team of senior international diplomats .
Iran 's parliamentary speaker , Ali Larijani , gave it a warmer welcome . ""
The parliament will carefully study the package , "" Larijani told the parliament , or Majlis .
He said Iran would welcome negotiations but would not forget its sovereign rights .
Alaeddin Boroujerdi , the head of the national security and foreign policy committee in the Majlis , told the Iranian news agency IRNA that "" we can reach an agreement over common points "" .
The British representative accompanying Solana , Mark Lyall Grant , the foreign office 's political director , stayed on in Tehran yesterday for bilateral talks .
British officials said before the Solana mission that they did not expect the package to be accepted - it is similar to a proposal rejected in 2006 - but hoped it would stimulate a debate among conservative Iranian politicians over the economic costs of pursuing enrichment and reprocessing , which the UN security council wants suspended because of the risk of proliferation .
However , a senior British source said Iran would be given only about a month to make up its mind before new EU sanctions were imposed , targeting Iran 's biggest bank , Bank Melli .
Talks over a fourth wave of sanctions for Iran would also start at the security council .
Russia and China are resistant to tougher sanctions , arguing that they risk driving Iran deeper into isolation and defiance .
As a consequence , the US may seek to assemble a "" coalition of the willing "" for direct action , possibly including a naval blockade of Iranian shipping in the Persian Gulf or a ban on exports of equipment and technology for Iran 's oil industry .
President Bush also refuses to exclude the option of using military force before he leaves office next January .
Israeli officials have said their country might carry out military action against Iran 's nuclear facilities rather than accept its emergence as a nuclear rival in the region .
Alongside the nuclear proposals in the Solana package , were offers to lift all restrictions on trade with Iran , including the export of airliner spare parts that Iranian aviation badly needs , and support for Iranian membership of the World Trade Organisation ."
2008-06-21,"British special forces operating on the border between Afghanistan and Iran have uncovered fresh evidence that Tehran is actively backing insurgents fighting UK troops .
Documented proof that Iran is supplying the Taliban with devastating roadside bomb - making equipment has been passed by British officials to Tehran , prompting fears that the war in Afghanistan may escalate into a regional armed conflict .
Days after Prime Minister Gordon Brown warned President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that Britain would freeze the assets of Iran 's largest bank to discourage Tehran from developing nuclear weapons , Whitehall sources revealed that they had forwarded ' documentation ' that the Iranian authorities were supplying enemy forces in Afghanistan . '
We have given Tehran documentation of things that we are concerned about , but of course they have denied it , ' a Whitehall source said .
Nato spokesman James Appathurai echoed concerns that elements in Iran are providing support to insurgents fighting British troops .
He said : ' Weapons of Iranian origin have turned up in Afghanistan in significant numbers . '
The situation is so serious that the UK government is believed to have asked Russia and India to raise the issue with Tehran , and to emphasise its wider implications .
Evidence found by UK special forces is understood to concern the supply of the same bomb - making equipment Iran provides to insurgents in Iraq , namely components for explosively formed projectiles , or EFPs .
Senior Whitehall sources said they were concerned about Iran 's ' nefarious ' influence in the supply of ' lethal aid ' in the form of EFPs , which are capable of penetrating the strongest British armour and have killed at least 17 British soldiers in Iraq .
EFPs work by concentrating explosive force through a concave copper plate , which is projected as a molten missile through a vehicle 's armour .
EFPs are so effective they have even penetrated a British Challenger 2 tank in Iraq .
A sophisticated machining process traced to Iran is needed to manufacture their components .
It is not clear whether the bomb that last week killed four British SAS reservists in Helmand province was such a device , although British military commanders fear that increasing Iranian involvement in Afghanistan may render irrelevant attempts to increase the number of armoured vehicles in the conflict .
Yesterday four coalition soldiers were killed by a bomb in the province of Kandahar .
Ideological differences between Iran , a Shia Muslim state , and the Taliban , a Sunni militia , are thought to have been settled in light of the shared aim in attacking coalition forces .
Meanwhile , as investigations continue into the use of Snatch Land Rovers in southern Afghanistan in which the four UK troops died last week , new figures obtained by The Observer reveal that more than 700 armoured vehicles that could be deployed to protect British personnel in Helmand are out of action .
In total , 712 of the 2,136 Warrior and Saxon vehicles , as well as highly mobile types such as the Scimitar , owned by the armed forces are either being repaired or have been destroyed .
Nick Clegg , the leader of the Liberal Democrats , said the punishing environment of Afghanistan and need to cannibalise vehicles for parts was partly to blame .
A spokesman for the MoD said : ' The safety of our personnel is a prime concern .
We have done a lot in the last two years to ensure that commanders have a variety of vehicles with different capabilities at their disposal . '"
2008-07-08,"Iran kept up a barrage of conflicting messages over its nuclear programme yesterday , threatening to strike the US navy and "" set Israel alight "" if it was attacked .
But Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the president , dismissed the threat of war as a "" silly joke "" , even as he again rejected the idea that Iran halt uranium enrichment - the key demand of the international community repeated at the G8 summit in Japan .
The strongest language came from Ali Shirazi , an aide to Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has ultimate say over the most sensitive issues .
"" The first US shot against Iran would set the United States ' vital interests in the world on fire , "" said Shirazi , a cleric who is Khamenei 's representative to the elite Revolutionary Guards naval forces .
""
Tel Aviv and the US fleet in the Persian Gulf would be the targets that would be set on fire in Iran 's crushing response , "" he said , the Fars news agency reported .
Analysts said that while Iran has often warned of a crushing response to any aggression , specific warnings of this kind are unusual .
The phrase echoed threats made by Saddam Hussein against Israel on the eve of the 1991 Gulf war .
It was the latest in a series of now almost daily exchanges over Iran 's nuclear programme including signals from Israel and the US that they would not tolerate a nuclear - armed Iran .
Washington and its allies accuse Iran of secretly working to develop a nuclear weapon .
Tehran says it has no military ambitions and is simply seeking to generate power for civil purposes .
Shirazi 's remarks came as Revolutionary Guard missile and naval units began war games - codenamed
The Great Prophet III - aimed at "" improving the combat capability "" of the forces .
The Guards are responsible for Iran 's most significant ballistic missiles including the Shahab-3 , whose range puts Israel and US bases in the Gulf within reach .
Ahmadinejad told a news conference in Malaysia that he hoped to see a fresh approach by the next US administration to make up for the "" domineering hegemony "" of George Bush . ""
I assure you that there wo n't be any war in the future , "" he said , predicting that Israel 's "" regime "" would collapse without the need for Iranian action .
He dismissed the idea of war as "" a silly joke . ""
The US was no longer in a position to attack Iran . ""
In the US , his wise scholars will not allow Mr Bush to commit political suicide and of course the economic , political and military situation will not allow Mr Bush to do that , "" he said .
Ahmadinejad also told the leaders of the G8 that their policies would "" accelerate them along the road to a precipice "" and reiterated he would not accept demands to stop enriching uranium , which can be used as fuel for nuclear power plants and to make warheads if refined to a higher degree .
Despite these comments , diplomacy is still being actively pursued .
Javier Solana , the EU 's foreign policy chief , is to return to Iran for talks with its top nuclear negotiator , Saeed Jalili , before the end of the month , Nicolas Sarkozy , the French president , told reporters at the G8 summit .
Solana presented Iran with a revised package of economic , technical and political incentives last month on behalf of the five permanent members of the UN security council , plus Germany .
Crucially , the package includes an offer of assistance with civilian nuclear technology that has been widely publicised in the Iranian media and appears to have helped stimulate a lively internal debate among the country 's leaders .
Solana described Tehran 's weekend response as a "" complicated and difficult letter that must be thoroughly analysed "" .
French officials said the Iranian document failed to mention halting uranium enrichment or a reciprocal "" freeze for freeze "" which would halt sanctions against Iran .
"" There is no give on the substance whatsoever , "" said one diplomat ."
2008-07-20,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , described Saturday 's international talks on his country 's nuclear programme as a "" step forward "" yesterday , although western officials said the negotiations ended in deadlock .
Ahmadinejad told Iranian state radio that his government 's official response would be announced soon .
His remarks offered a glimmer of hope after talks in Geneva ended with no sign of a resolution of the nuclear standoff between Iran and the UN security council , despite the direct participation for the first time of a senior US official .
Iran has repeatedly rejected security council demands for it to suspend uranium enrichment , despite three waves of UN sanctions .
On Saturday , a six - nation team led by the EU foreign policy chief , Javier Solana , flew to Geneva to hear Iran 's response to an interim proposal : for Iran to stop the expansion of its enrichment programme in return for a moratorium on added sanctions .
In response , Iranian delegate , Saeed Jalili , presented a paper at the meeting that outlined a three - stage process .
According to the Iranian document , the first stage would involve three meetings to talk about "" modalities "" for further talks .
In the second phase , there would be a freeze on sanctions but Iran would only have to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency , something Iran already claims to be doing .
In the third phase , all sanctions would be dropped and Iran would "" implement the agreed action "" , but the action was not specified .
"" There 's nothing in it to be honest , "" a western participant at the talks said .
"" What they appear to want to do is spin out the first phase , which Solana told them we have been in for at least the past three years . ""
Solana gave Jalili two weeks to consult Tehran and get back to him , and told journalists that it had been made clear to the Iranian government "" today and every day "" that it faced further international sanctions if it did not agree to the plan .
"" Iran 's strategic options are rapidly foreclosing , "" a European source at the talks said .
Some officials from the Solana team still held out hope that Jalili might return to Tehran and convince the Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that the international community remained united in its determination to force the suspension of uranium enrichment , and force a change of heart . ""
If the plan was to string this along , they would have got the message that 's not going to work , "" a western official said .
"" To be honest I 'm not optimistic .
Although maybe they are waiting for a change of administration in Washington before they signal some kind of flexibility . """
2008-07-23,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad today claimed that US participation in the latest round of talks was recognition of Iran 's right to acquire nuclear technology .
And he added that Iran would not "" retreat one iota "" over its disputed nuclear ambitions .
The talks ended on Saturday with no sign of a resolution of the nuclear standoff between Iran and the UN security council , despite the direct participation for the first time of a senior US official .
US involvement had raised expectations of a compromise formula , under which Iran would agree to stop expanding its enrichment activities .
In exchange , the six powers engaged in the talks — the US and five other world powers ( UK , China , Germany , Russia and France )
— would hold off on adopting new UN sanctions against Iran .
Washington and its western allies feared Iran was seeking to acquire nuclear weapons and demanded it freeze its uranium enrichment .
Iran said its nuclear programme was confined to generating domestic energy .
The enrichment issue was key to the dispute over Iran 's nuclear programme because the activity can produce either fuel for nuclear power stations or material used in the fissile core of warheads .
Iran already defied three sets of UN sanctions over its uranium enrichment activity .
But recent pronouncements suggested Tehran was looking to improve ties with the US .
Iranian officials spoke positively of deliberations by the Bush administration to open an interests section in Tehran after closing its embassy decades ago .
Ahmadinejad said the US undersecretary of state , William Burns , who was present at the Geneva talks , "" spoke politely and in a dignified manner "" .
He also described the US 's decision to attend the talks as a "" positive step forward , "" which would help repair America 's image in the world .
Adressing thousands of supporters in the southern town of Yasouj , Ahmadinejad said : "" You [ the US ] took a positive step .
It was a step toward recognising the rights of the Iranian nation , toward justice , toward repairing your image in the world , toward cleaning 50 years of crimes you committed against the Iranian nation . ""
Rice said all six nations were serious about a two - week deadline for Iran to agree to freeze suspect activities and start negotiations , or be hit with new penalties .
She accused Iran on Monday of not being serious about the negotiations .
Ahmadinejad urged the US to continue its "" positive "" attendance in the talks .
"" I advise you not to ruin the positive step you took through irrelevant words and claims . """
2008-07-23,"The Guardian has revealed that the United States plans to establish a low - level diplomatic mission in Tehran , for the first time in nearly three decades .
"" We will receive favourably any action which will help to reinforce relations between the peoples , "" a conciliatory Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told reporters .
Striking an equally conciliatory note , US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice said last month : "" We are determined to reach out to the Iranian people . ""
In addition , undersecretary of state William Burns is attending nuclear talks with Iran this weekend .
So , can we all breathe a sigh of relief and will a special interests section be enough to keep the hawks at bay ?
I certainly hope so , for everyone 's sake , but I am not holding my breath .
After all , none of the points of contention between Iran , on the one side , and the US and Israel , on the other , have yet been resolved – and Iran and Israel , with US backing , have been incredibly reckless in their brinkmanship .
Of course , Iran insists that it is a law - abiding global citizen and that its nuclear ambitions are civilian , and hence within the scope of international law .
In fact a House of Common 's investigation concluded that : "" We do not believe that the United States or any other country has the right to dictate to Iran how it meets its increasing demand for electricity . ""
Nevertheless , is a civilian nuclear programme worth the prospect of war and why does n't the country develop less controversial technology to get itself out of the fix ?
The doubters see in this defiance a confirmation that Iran is working on a covert nuclear weapons programme , although those who advocate this view have not yet come up with a shred of convincing evidence .
Given the "" logic "" of nuclear proliferation , if Iran were in fact building a bomb , it would have , in theory , sound strategic reasons for doing so , hemmed in as it is by the US army on two fronts , and within striking range of nuclear - armed Israel , Pakistan and India .
But surely Tehran must know that before they have finished building a reactor , Israel , like it did in Iraq in the 1980s , or the US , would level it , although it would n't be quite the cakewalk it was in Baghdad .
Assuming the programme is civilian , a rationalist and pragmatist might well ask : why develop a technology you can ill - afford and for which you have no domestic capacity ?
Moreover , what is the need in an inflamed situation for bellicose pronouncements and dangerous sabre - rattling ?
As a sceptic , I would say that President Ahmadinejad and the hardline clerics who now have the upper hand are exploiting the classic politics of fear and patriotism in a bid to hold back the liberalisation Iranians demand , and to divert domestic attention away from their dismal socio - economic and human rights record .
This captures part of the picture , but we must not overlook the deeply ingrained suspicion and even paranoia that underpins and undermines Iran 's relationship with the Pax Americana .
Although most ordinary Iranians do not share the regime 's strident anti - westernism and admire much about the west , they do harbour a great deal of distrust .
Iranians , like many Middle Easterners , feel that their aspirations to determine their fate and to become members of the modern world have been partly stifled by western interference : from engineered regime to change to propping up the corrupt and oppressive shah , to arming its arch rival Iraq .
There are also plenty of internal reasons .
Such a sense of weakness is painful for Iran , which was a major imperial power in ancient times until the Arab conquests , and the Safavid dynasty , although not Persian in origin , restored some of that lost sense of power .
In addition to suspicion and fear , another issue is pride .
Given Persia 's status as the cradle of modern science , Iran has made numerous efforts to revive that legacy , which could partly explain the current regime 's nuclear obsession , and the Shah 's before it .
But Iran is not alone in these sentiments .
Much of the Middle East is still reeling from centuries of foreign domination , whether Muslim or European , and this has led to an identity crisis that can manifest itself as a sense of paranoia towards the outside world .
In fact , as I 've argued before , western insensitivity to local sensibilities and its unreasonable demands for completely pliant "" client rulers "" is partly behind the rise of hardline leaders .
It is high time for the US to rethink the client state model .
Even Israel , which many regard as being somehow outside the Middle East , suffers , in its own way , from the same malaise .
Although Israelis did not suffer from colonialism in the classical way , ie as strangers in their own land , they have spent many centuries perceived as strangers in other lands .
Like Ahmadinejad , Ehud Olmert , who has been on the back foot domestically , has tried to use the sabre - rattling with Iran and the disastrous invasion of Lebanon to deflect criticism of his government 's record .
However , with their perception of being surrounded by enemies and the still - fresh trauma of pogroms and the Holocaust , many ordinary Israelis are in a true panic over Iran 's nuclear programme , and believe its official designation as an "" existential threat "" .
In addition , the "" tough Jew "" mentality that still dominates Zionist ideals is one of the factors behind Israel 's own sabre - rattling and brinkmanship .
So , what 's to be done about all this deep - seated distrust in a volatile region ?
Well , I propose that a campaign is started to encourage all Middle Eastern countries to sign a mutual non - aggression pact .
After that , a regional security council should be set up where Arab , Israelis , Iranians and Turks can discuss directly their security concerns .
Then efforts to transform the region into a WMD - free area should be re - started in earnest ."

Media ' add to strains on health of princess '
Doctors have warned that intense media scrutiny of Japanese Crown Princess Masako could worsen a stress - induced ailment from which she is suffering .
The condition has kept the 44-year - old princess , who married Crown Prince Naruhito , 48 , in 1993 , from most of her official duties at home and abroad for several years .
Pressures to produce a male heir and conform to palace traditions are thought to have made her condition worse .

2008-08-05,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , was always going to have a problem paying homage to Mustafa Kemal Ataturk , founding father of modern Turkey and a leader synonymous with secularism .
But in a move that has revived criticisms of its alleged Islamist sympathies , Turkey 's ruling Justice and Development party has got around the difficulty by inviting the Iranian leader to Istanbul , the former Ottoman capital , instead of Ankara , the Turkish capital and site of the Ataturk mausoleum .
Ahmadinejad said he was unwilling to go to the late leader 's mausoleum in Ankara , a courtesy which protocol demands of all visiting foreign leaders .
As the architect of the modern Turkish state that consciously subjugates Islam , Ataturk was the antithesis of everything the devout Iranian president represents .
He was also an ally and role model of Reza Shah , father of Iran 's last shah , Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , who was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution that brought the theocratic regime to power .
Turkish officials have tried to gloss over the exceptional arrangements by describing Ahmadinejad 's visit next week as a "" working "" trip .
He will meet the Turkish prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , and President Abdullah Gul for talks likely to be dominated by Iran 's nuclear programme , an issue on which Turkey has tried to establish itself as an intermediary between Tehran and the west .
However , pro - secularist Turkish newspapers have overlooked the subject matter to focus on the perceived snub to Ataturk , prompting Turkey 's foreign minister , Ali Babacan , to accuse them of risking the visit 's success .
"" Iran is a very important country that is on the active agenda of the entire world , "" he said .
"" I consider these discussions concerning the details of the visit ... irrelevant in the context of such an important process .
They will cast a shadow over the essence of the visit . ""
Ahmadinejad 's arrival follows Babacan 's attendance last week at the non - aligned movement talks in Tehran , where he met Iran 's nuclear negotiator , Saeed Jalili , and Manouchehr Mottaki , the foreign minister .
It is the latest phase in an intense round of Turkish - led diplomacy which yesterday saw Erdogan host the Syrian president , Bashar al - Assad , in an effort to resolve the long - running dispute with Israel over the Golan Heights .
US officials played down a report in one Turkish newspaper which suggested that the Bush administration had objected to Ahmadinejad 's trip ."
2008-08-11,"King Abdullah of Jordan became the first Arab head of state to visit Baghdad since the 2003 invasion yesterday , responding to US pressure to normalise ties with the Shia - dominated Iraqi government .
The king , a close ally of Washington , went straight into talks with the prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki , though the symbolism of the meeting was more important than the substance .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the Iranian president , visited Baghdad in March , but Iraq 's Sunni Arab neighbours have been slow to come to terms with post - Saddam realities .
Premature publicity caused Abdullah to postpone a visit planned for last month .
Jordan has also announced that it is returning its ambassador to Baghdad , as have several small Gulf states .
"" The parties discussed the progress made by Iraq and especially that of the Iraqi government 's success in security and future reconstruction projects , "" said a joint statement .
Abdullah 's visit - lasting less than four hours - was agreed during a visit to Amman by Maliki in June to renew a 2006 agreement to sell discounted oil to his cash - strapped neighbour , which relies on Iraq for most of its fuel needs .
Washington has been pressing its Arab allies , notably the regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia , to write off Iraqi debt and send their envoys back to Baghdad .
But Sunni suspicions have been slow to fade .
In 2004 , Abdullah famously warned against the emergence in Iraq of a pro - Iranian government that would be part of a "" Shia crescent "" linking Iran , Iraq , Syria and Lebanon - a blunt formulation the normally careful king came to regret ."
2008-08-12,"When sceptical MPs questioned the eligibility of Ali Kordan to be Iran 's interior minister , he believed he had the perfect riposte ; a law degree obtained from one of the world 's most elite institutions , the University of Oxford .
He even flaunted a graduation certificate on university - headed paper purporting to award him an "" honorary doctorate of law "" for "" opening a new chapter "" in comparative legal studies .
Now Kordan 's extravagant claims have landed him in hot water and severely embarrassed the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad after the university denied ever having awarded him a degree .
Less than a week after being confirmed in his post , he is facing calls to resign after Ali Larijani , the speaker of Iran 's parliament , the Majlis , ordered a committee to investigate the authenticity of his academic qualifications .
Kordan , a former revolutionary guard and university lecturer , was approved against strong opposition in a parliamentary vote after Ahmadinejad , in a highly unusual step , told MPs that his nomination had the personal backing of Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
But pressure on him grew after media outlets followed up allegations by some MPs that his claims to Oxford alma mater status were fantasy and that his academic qualifications amounted to no more than a mid - level college diploma .
Amid a flurry of speculation , Kordan released a copy of his Oxford "" certificate "" in an attempt to lay the matter to rest .
Dated June 2000 , the certificate said Kordan had "" shown great effort in preparing educational materials "" and bore the signatures of three professors , Edmund Rolls , Alan Cowey and PE Bryant in a awarding him a degree from the university 's "" faculty of the college of law "" .
Rather than quell the controversy , however , the document only fuelled it further after the news website , Alef - linked to Ahmad Tavakoli , head of the parliament 's research centre and a critic of Ahmadinejad - passed it to the University of Oxford , which disavowed it .
In a statement , the university said : "" The University of Oxford has no record of Mr Ali Kordan receiving an honorary doctorate or any other degree from the university . ""
Professor Edmund Rolls , Professor Peter Bryant and Professor Alan Cowey have all at some stage held posts at the University of Oxford .
However , none of them work in the field of law , and none of them would sign degree certificates .
""
A spokesperson said the university generally awarded honorary degrees to distinguished scholars .
Alef posted the statement on its site alongside Kordan 's "" certificate "" , in which it gleefully pointed out several grammatical and spelling errors , including a misspelling of the word entitle as "" intitle "" .
The government hit back yesterday by blocking internet access to Alef , a tactic it has used against other critical sites .
Ahmadinejad - who is not considered close to Kordan and only nominated him as a compromise candidate - has publicly defended him by saying he should not be judged on a "" piece of torn paper "" , a phrase he has often used to dismiss UN security council resolutions against Iran 's nuclear programme ."
2008-08-14,"Turkey delivered a humiliating snub to Iran 's visiting president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , yesterday by backing out of a lucrative energy deal under pressure from the US government , which feared it would enhance Iranian nuclear ambitions .
Signing the £ 1.87bn agreement to provide Turkey with Iranian natural gas - on which memoranda of understanding had already been agreed - was to have been the crowning achievement of Ahmadinejad 's two - day visit to Istanbul , which Turkish officials had agreed to after intense Iranian lobbying .
Iran is Turkey 's second - biggest energy supplier after Russia and has been seeking to woo Turkish investment in its South Pars gas fields .
But as Ahmadinejad met his Turkish counterpart , Abdullah Gül , at Ciragan Palace in Istanbul , it emerged that US intervention had effectively torpedoed a deal .
Rather than unveiling the expected landmark agreement , a press conference by the two leaders last night merely yielded a joint statement in which the countries "" reiterated their desire for on - going cooperation "" .
Turkish officials had earlier cited Iranian pricing and investment conditions as a reason for stalling .
However , that appeared to be a smokescreen aimed at disguising Turkish deference to American demands .
A western diplomatic source told the Guardian that Turkey had pledged not to sign any major energy deals with Iran in return for Washington 's blessing for Ahmadinejad 's visit after Bush administration officials privately criticised it . ""
Steve Hadley ( the US national security adviser ) voiced objections to Ahmadinejad 's trip when he visited Ankara a month ago , "" the source said .
"" The attitude was , we 've allowed them to host [ Manouchehr ] Mottaki and [ Saeed ] Jalili ( respectively , Iran 's foreign minister and chief nuclear negotiator ) , but having Ahmadinejad was sending the wrong signal . ""
However , the Turks explained that he had been pressing for a visit to Turkey for a while and that they could n't say no any longer .
To meet American reservations , they promised they would n't sign any major energy deals , apart from maybe something on electricity , and would pressure Ahmadinejad to accept the UN security council incentive package in exchange for suspending uranium enrichment . ""
Amid suspicions that Iran 's nuclear programme is aimed at building an atomic bomb , the US and the security council 's four other permanent members - Britain , France , Russia and China , plus Germany - have pressed Tehran to suspend it through a combination of sweeteners and sanctions .
Iran refuses and insists the programme is for peaceful purposes .
In recent weeks , Turkey - a Nato member and ally of the US and Israel - has used gradually improving bilateral ties to engage senior Iranian officials on the dispute .
Turkey says it is opposed to a nuclear - armed Iran but has encouraged cooperation on other issues , including military action against Kurdish rebels .
However , Ahmadinejad 's trip has generated criticism at home and abroad , including from Israel , which said it was "" disappointed "" at the invitation .
Turkey 's authorities have responded by downgrading the visit to "" working "" status and hosting it in Istanbul rather than the capital Ankara , a decision which enabled the religiously devout Iranian leader to avoid visiting the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk , founder of the modern secular Turkish state .
Cengiz Aktar , professor of EU studies at Istanbul 's Bahcesehir university , said the absence of an energy deal meant Ahmadinejad 's visit had been of little value to Turkey . ""
Turkey can not treat Iran as the westerners do .
"" It is our neighbour after all .
It 's realpolitik -
we are obliged to this evil . """
2008-08-25,"Ayatollah backs second term for Ahmadinejad President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has received a major boost to his political authority after Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader , told a cabinet meeting that he should prepare for a second term in office in advance of June 's presidential election . ""
Do not think this year is your final year , "" Khamenei was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA .
His support is key to the re - election chances of Ahmadinejad , whose economic policies have been widely criticised .
Khamenei controls loyalist groups , such as the revolutionary guard , which can spearhead voter mobilisation efforts .

At least 25 people are feared dead after Sudanese security forces raided one of Darfur 's largest camps for displaced people .
Witnesses said government forces massed outside Kalma camp near Nyala in south Darfur before dawn yesterday , reportedly to search for illegal weapons and wanted persons .
Several hours of gunfire ensued .
The aid agency Médecins Sans Frontières said it had 65 wounded people , mainly women and children , in its clinic .
One of Darfur 's main rebel movements accused the government of trying to force the camp 's 90,000 residents to return home .

2008-08-27,"This blog is Deadline USA , not Deadline Iran , so we do n't usually comment on Iranian politics .
However , in light of McCain 's new advert that rattles the sabre on Iran and distorts Obama 's position on the country , I thought I would link to this story from the German edition of the Financial Times , via Reuters , via the conservative Jerusalem Post .
The story shows that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , lunatic and bellicose as he is , is n't the only force in Iranian politics and that reformers are ready to take him on , should the US give them breathing space . ""
Ahmadinejad is not complying with the will of the people , "" The Financial Times Deutschland quoted Grand Ayatollah Bajat Sanjani as saying .
"" This is a major threat , a big danger , "" the cleric added in an unusually direct personal attack ."
2008-09-17,"Hillary Clinton has backed out of a planned rally against the Iranian government after learning that protest organisers also invited Sarah Palin .
The rally in New York on Monday is sponsored by a coalition of US Jewish groups angered by Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's presence at the opening of the UN general assembly .
But the protest plan went awry after Clinton , a longtime ally of pro - Israel groups , discovered that the Republican vice - presidential nominee had also been asked to attend .
Clinton aides said they learnt of Palin 's invitation from the media , not the rally organisers .
"" Her attendance was news to us , and this was never billed to us as a partisan political event , "" a spokesman for the former first lady told the Associated Press .
A joint appearance by Clinton and Palin would have drawn intense interest , particularly given lingering questions over how strongly the New York senator has criticised Palin while campaigning for Barack Obama .
The rally also would have lent Palin some of Clinton 's formidable appeal to Jewish voters .
The Republican No 2 has struggled to beat back scepticism over her attendance at a church service that featured controversial remarks about terrorism in Israel .
The Clinton cancellation now leaves Palin the main draw at Monday 's event , after which she is expected to make introductions to foreign leaders with running mate John McCain at her side .
President George Bush is slated to address the UN gathering on Tuesday .
When asked about the Iran rally , Republican spokeswoman Tracy Schmitt sent a subtle jab at Clinton – whom Palin criticised earlier this year but has now taken to praising as she courts female voters . ""
Governor Palin believes that the danger of a nuclear Iran is greater than party or politics , "" Schmitt told Fox News . ""
She hopes that all parties can rally together in opposition to this grave threat . """
2008-09-23,"Let 's knock off this annual ritual of channeling our collective anger at Mahmoud Ahmadinejad every time the bozo visits the UN .
The charade gets old quick .
We parade him in front of the television cameras as some host asks him pointed questions that they already know the answers to ( or not , in some cases : NPR asked him whether he listened to Led Zeppelin or the Beatles , as if those were the hottest two bands blazing up the pop charts ) .
This line of questioning just allows the Iranian leader to cut a sympathetic figure .
Indeed , Ahmadinejad has become such a lightning rod that the most serious of protests can spiral downward into downright silliness .
Yesterday at Dag Hammarskjöld plaza , over the din of church bells at Holy Family Church , shouts of "" Shalom "" at a rally could be heard blocks away .
A rabbi said the Iranian leadership was involved in genocide worse than that of Rwanda or the Balkans , while someone unfurled a banner with a drawing of the Iranian president 's motorcade hitting a "" steampipe blast "" - the usual doomsday stuff of protests .
There were pleas to "" Stop Iran Now "" but not a shred of clarity on a ) what to stop Iran from doing , or b ) how to stop Iran from doing it .
There were impassioned pleas for Iran to curb its human rights abuses ( Iran is the world 's leading killer of juvenile offenders , according to Human Rights Watch ) .
Then there were pleas for Iran to stop enriching uranium and violating nuclear safeguard agreements of the nonproliferation treaty .
And , of course , there was usual boilerplate stuff aimed at the Iranian leader 's Holocaust denialism and statements about wiping Israel off the map .
But how do you stop Iran – or , in this case , Ahmadinejad - from doing and saying the nasty things it does and says ?
Some present yesterday at the UN supported tougher sanctions , while others wanted to drop a nuke on Natanz , a nuclear reactor .
Not many called for tougher diplomacy - as the UN was a feckless institution , they thought .
"" The UN is doing the same thing as the League of Nations did before World War II , "" chimed in Akiva Adler , a 17-year - old from Toronto , Canada .
OK fair enough .
But the trouble with all the focus paid to Ahmadinejad is that it ignores serious considerations of foreign policy ( ie diplomacy ) aimed at containing Iranian aggression by the state , not the president .
By narrowly paying attention only to one leader , we needlessly personalise the conflict at the risk of having no clear plan in place for the day when Ahmadinejad leaves office - which he may very well do next year .
Our policies seem more aimed at containing him , not containing Iran .
Unfortunately , that ignores the fact he is not even in charge of Iranian foreign policy - the Supreme Leader is .
By demonising and parodying every utterance of Ahmadinejad 's , we are complicit in propping him up in the eyes of the world .
His popularity on the Arab street stems less from the vitriol he spouts than from our own visceral hatred of him .
Do n't get me wrong : I find Iran 's president to be a reprehensible person unworthy of the UN stage ( or any primetime network slot , for that matter ) .
But let 's stop calling the man "" Little Adolf "" and have a serious discussion of US - Iranian relations .
Let 's talk about opening up an American interests section in Tehran and lose the Swiss as our intermediaries .
Let 's talk about a package of security guarantees and tough sanctions if Iran does not comply with IAEA inspections .
And let 's knock off this talk of an Israeli - led pre - emptive strike against Iran 's nuclear facilities - something Harvard 's Ashton Carter predicts has a 50 % chance of occurring before the next American president is inaugurated in January - which would only set Iran 's nuclear ambitions back by two years at most and destroy any well of pro - western goodwill that exists among young Iranians ( who , incidentally , make up 70 % of the population ) .
Feel free to protest Iran 's president as he bounces around town today and smirks before the cameras .
But do n't expect anything meaningful to change in our relations with Iran until we address Tehran 's foreign policy , not just Ahmadinejad 's rabblerousing rhetoric .
Stop falling into his trap .
The best thing to do to somebody of his stature is to just ignore him .
Sorry to say , but this is not Munich all over again .
Ahmadinejad is a bit player on the world stage , not a leader bent on taking over the Middle East .
By treating him like this outsized figure , we hand him undue influence and power .
That is why every September he never stops smirking ."
2008-09-24,"It was another strange day in this ever more strange election campaign , with the focus split between New York and Washington , and the presidential candidates playing a decidedly marginal role .
On Capitol Hill , treasury secretary Henry Paulson continued to try to sell the Bush administration 's bailout plan to an angry Congress , whose members pressured him to toughen it up , while at the United Nations the president added lines on the economy to his speech .
He did n't get much of a reception : fewer than 10 seconds of polite applause - and a "" thumbs - down "" gesture from Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the president of Iran , whose own speech was a typically anti - Bush and anti - Israel affair .
Barack Obama , engaged in intensive debate preparation in Florida , surfaced to condemn Ahmadinejad 's "" outrageous remarks "" , and also Bush 's "" my - way - or - the - highway intransigence "" on the bailout .
John McCain , meanwhile , once again played second fiddle to his running - mate , Sarah Palin , who met the heads of state of Afghanistan and Colombia , and Henry Kissinger , in New York .
The McCain / Palin campaign engaged in a brief spat with the written press , which it initially tried to exclude from covering her handshakes with the world leaders , before eventually relenting .
But the next round in McCain 's war with the media seemed likely to be far more vicious : late last night , the New York Times reported on its website that a firm owned by McCain 's campaign manager , Rick Davis , had received payments of $ 15,000 a month until last month from Freddie Mac , one of the mortgage giants implicated in the current economic crisis , in contradiction to the campaign 's claims .
What to watch out for McCain and Palin remain in New York today , while Obama is in Florida , preparing for Friday 's debate , which is expected to receive the highest television audience for a political debate in history .
Palin will meet Katie Couric , for an interview to be broadcast on tonight 's CBS Evening News ; despite her friendly exterior , Couric has been known to lob tough questions at her interviewees .
Latest polls Obama remains just ahead in most daily tracking polls : for example , Gallup has him at 47 % to 44 % , down from 48 % to 44 % yesterday .
A Washington Post / ABC poll puts Obama nine points ahead of McCain , attributing his lead to turmoil in the financial industry ( just 9 % of those polled rate the US economy as good or excellent , the first time this figure has been in single digits since before the 1992 election ) .
A new Pew poll meanwhile gives Obama a huge lead as the candidate voters consider best able to address the financial crisis : 47 % to McCain 's 35 % .
But a majority of those questioned backed the US government 's bailout plan nonetheless .

Has the McCain campaign 's war on the media earned it contempt even from the AP ? ""
ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( AP )
Less than a week after balking at the Alaska Legislature 's investigation into her alleged abuse of power , Gov. Sarah Palin on Monday indicated she will cooperate with a separate probe run by people she can fire . """
2008-09-25,"While the west has at times been divided in its evaluation of the threat posed by Iran 's nuclear programme , in Israel the feeling is unambiguous .
Israelis believe the threat is best exemplified by Iran 's hardline president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who has repeatedly expressed his contempt for their country since taking office in 2005 .
Ahmadinejad has described the Holocaust as a myth and most famously , in 2006 , was reported as saying he wanted to see Israel "" wiped off the map "" .
There were claims that the quote was inaccurate but either way he has shown little love towards Israel and has used threats towards the country to try to boost his popularity among Muslims angry at perceived injustices inflicted on the Palestinians .
Only yesterday , in New York for the UN general assembly , Ahmadinejad claimed that "" a small but deceitful minority of Zionists are playing with the American public "" , comments aimed at the forthcoming US election .
Israel 's geographical proximity to Iran and the fact that it is so resented by the Muslim world – who Ahmadinejad still looks to for support despite most leaders ' dislike of him - coupled with the military might of the US make Israel a much more likely target than America .
And for the Israelis , the idea of Ahmadinejad with his finger on a nuclear button is unthinkable .
After a US intelligence report published at the end of 2007 said Tehran 's nuclear weapons programme had been on hold since 2003 , Israel 's prime minister , Ehud Olmert , was quick to indicate that he did not agree , saying that "" all options are on the table "" .
Israel is said to believe that Iran could possess a nuclear bomb as soon as 2010 .
Israeli officials were reportedly unhappy when the US announced plans to station diplomats in Iran for the first time since 1979 , fearing a softening of Washington 's stance towards Tehran .
And when Olmert announced a series of initiatives designed at ending long - running conflicts with Lebanon , Syria and Hamas earlier this year , Iran was conspicuous by its absence .
What is more , the talks with Syria were seen as a deliberate attempt to isolate Iran from the one Middle East country it could truly call an ally .
The world may have shuddered when Israel 's deputy prime minister , Shaul Mofaz , said in June that a strike on Iran 's nuclear sites would be "" unavoidable "" if Tehran refused to halt its alleged weapons programmes , but within Israel the reaction was more muted .
Mofaz himself was unrepentant , even going so far as to repeat the threat .
While Olmert publicly disassociated himself from the comments – Israel 's relationship with the US dictated that nothing less would be acceptable - he later assured the Israeli public : "" Iran will not be nuclear . ""
Olmert 's successor , Tzipi Livni , has also talked tough on Iran but the scale of her rhetoric has not touched that of Mofaz .
The Israeli public 's concerns were perhaps reflected by the fact that Mofaz – who had been viewed as an outsider – in the end only lost the election to be Kadima 's new leader to Livni by a whisker ."
2008-09-25,"This week , over 150 world leaders are gathered at the UN for the opening of the general assembly .
If recent years are any indication , news outlets will focus on the disagreements aired on Tuesday , when George Bush and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took the podium .
But the real drama occurs today ( Thursday ) , when the same global leaders that butted heads earlier in the week take stock of one of the most far - reaching and noble statements of international cooperation ever agreed upon , the millennium development goals .
These eight benchmarks , agreed upon at the World Summit in 2000 , are meant to be a statement of world support for the idea that all the world 's citizens have the right to basic healthcare , education and nutrition , and the mechanisms necessary to support themselves , among other things .
This week 's meeting roughly marks the midpoint to the 2015 target date .
So far , the glass looks half empty , but time has not yet run out .
What is required now above all is a renewed commitment to global development on the part of the US , which , despite the recent economic downturn , remains the world 's largest economy and dominant power .
First , the good news .
Thanks to improvements in prevention programmes and the availability of anti - retroviral treatments , we are starting to see a decline in the number of people who are becoming infected and dying from HIV / Aids for the first time since the UN started collecting data .
Measles is also on the decline .
Deaths from measles fell from 750,000 worldwide in 2000 to under 250,000 in 2007 .
Investments in malaria prevention are also showing results .
The distribution of life - saving insecticide - treated bed nets is now widespread in 16 out of 20 malaria - endemic countries .
Finally , thanks to campaigns to forgive the debts of so - called "" highly indebted poor countries "" , the share of developing countries ' export earnings devoted to paying external debts has fallen from 12.5 % in 2000 to 6.6 % in 2006 .
We have seen some progress .
But data shows that it has been spread unevenly across the globe .
The situation in sub - Saharan Africa remains particularly bleak .
The global economic slowdown and rising cost of food has hit this region the hardest .
The goal of reducing by half the number of people who live on a dollar a day will not be met there .
To make matters worse , higher food prices threaten to push 100 m more people into poverty and erode the measured progress we have made toward reducing childhood malnutrition .
To compound all of these problems , international trade negotiations ( the so - called Doha round ) are years behind schedule and , even if they succeed , are in danger of being less development - focused than was once hoped .
Still , there is enough time for us to reach most , if not all , of these goals .
The US will play a pivotal role in whether or not those goals are achieved .
The first thing we need to do is increase foreign aid .
Americans are a generous people , and we expect the same of our government .
But most Americans would be surprised to learn , however , that only 0.17 % of our gross national income goes to government - sponsored development assistance programmes .
That puts the US second to last ( ahead of Greece ) among developed countries ' official development assistance expenditures .
True , our philanthropic and private sectors are much more active than in any other country .
But even the wealthiest philanthropy is no substitute for what the federal government can do .
Just throwing money at the problem , however , is not the answer .
We also need to reorganise our entire foreign aid apparatus , which has not undergone a significant overhaul since 1961 .
According to the Modernising Foreign Assistance Network , US foreign assistance is spread across as many as 24 government agencies and 50 programmes .
The Treasury department , state department , department of agriculture and sub - cabinet - level agencies like USAID and the Millennium Challenge Corporation compete with each other for precious foreign aid dollars .
On top of that , individual members of Congress often add earmarks to fund foreign aid projects of their own parochial interests instead of what 's best for those in need .
We need a strategic and comprehensive view of how to spend taxpayer dollars more wisely and toward a common purpose .
The Modernising Foreign Assistance Network advises that the next president fold these multiple arms of our aid apparatus into a single entity , which they recommend as a cabinet - level department of global development .
Clearly , a foreign aid bureaucracy developed in 1961 needs to be updated to meet 21st - century challenges .
There are hopeful signs that both our presidential candidates get this .
Barack Obama has proposed doubling America 's foreign development assistance to $ 50bn .
And , like Obama , John McCain considers eliminating extreme poverty and fighting HIV / Aids imperative to American national security interests .
These are decent first steps , but not enough .
Fighting global poverty today is a wise down payment on a more stable and prosperous future .
The millennium development goals tells us what needs to be done to live in a world free of extreme , endemic poverty .
The next president can show us how to get there ."
2008-09-29,"Iranian President , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has made a remarkable announcement .
He 's admitted that Iran might agree to the existence of the state of Israel .
Ahmadinejad was asked : "" If the Palestinian leaders agree to a two - state solution , could Iran live with an Israeli state ? ""
This was his astonishing reply : If they [ the Palestinians ] want to keep the Zionists , they can stay ...
Whatever the people decide , we will respect it .
I mean , it 's very much in correspondence with our proposal to allow Palestinian people to decide through free referendums .
Since most Palestinians are willing to accept a two - state solution , the Iranian president is , in effect , agreeing to Israel 's right to exist and opening the door to a peace deal that Iran will endorse .
Ahmadinejad made this apparently extraordinary shift in policy during an interview last week when he was in New York to address the UN general assembly .
He was interviewed on September 24 by reporters Juan Gonzalez , writing for the New York Daily News , and Amy Goodman for the current affairs TV programme , Democracy Now .
You can watch the full interview and read the full text on the Democracy Now website .
Surprisingly , Ahmadinejad 's sensational softening of his long - standing , point - blank anti - Israeli stance was not even headlined by the two reporters .
Perhaps this was a decision by their editors ?
Did they not want to admit that Ahmadinejad may have , for once , said something vaguely progressive ?
Equally odd , the story was n't picked up by the world 's media .
For many years , the Iranian president has been vilified , usually justifiably .
Now , when he says something positive and helpful , the media ignores it .
Is this because of some anti - Iran or pro - Israel agenda ?
Why ignore a statement that is , from any political and journalistic perspective , a radical departure from Ahmadinejad 's previous unyielding anti - Israel tirades ?
Only a week earlier in Tehran he was saying that the Israeli state would not survive .
Confused ?
Are n't we all .
Will the real Mahmoud Ahmadinejad please stand up ?
Is he a deceiver and an unprincipled opportunist who will say anything to further Iran 's political agenda ?
Or could it be that beneath his often demagogic public rhetoric against Israel he is , in fact , open to options more moderate than his reported remarks about wiping the Israeli state off the map ?
I am not defending or endorsing Ahmadinejad in any way , shape or form .
Indeed , I am on record as being one of Ahmadinejad 's harshest critics .
I 've protested dozens of times outside the Iranian Embassy in London and written scores of articles exposing his regime 's persecution of trade unionists , students , journalists , human rights defenders , women 's equality campaigners , gay people , Sunni Muslims and ethnic minorities such as the Arabs , Kurds , Azeris and Balochis .
You can watch my Talking with Tatchell online TV programmes on the Iranian regime 's anti - Arab racism here , and on the rising popular resistance to its police state methods here .
But I also hope I am open - minded and fair .
Even I can see that Ahmadinejad appears to have moderated his position and is now apparently willing , with Palestinian agreement , to accept the co - existence of two states : Israel and Palestine .
Many Israelis and their allies will no doubt say Ahmadinejad ca n't be trusted ; that his comments were part of a manipulative charm offensive during his visit to the UN in New York .
They may be right .
But even if he is being disingenuous , that fact that he 's made this public concession on Israel at all is a softening of sorts .
News of what he said will filter back to Tehran and he 'll have to account for his words to his government , including the hardline anti - Israel ayatollahs and revolutionary guards .
I wonder what they think ?
Call me naive , but in my view Ahmadinejad 's words were of major significance .
He ought be pressed by world leaders , and Israel , to repeat them and to clarify them .
His statement might , and I emphasise might , be evidence that Iran is open to some negotiation on the future of the Israeli state .
If Israel 's leaders had any sense , they would ignore past provocations by Iran and seize this moment to have dialogue with the Palestinian and Iranian leaders on a two - state solution .
What Ahmadinejad has said could be an opening to diffuse the stand - off between Iran and Israel .
I am not relenting one inch in my condemnation of Ahmadinejad 's regime , with its grisly torture chambers , execution of juvenile offenders and neocolonial subjugation of national minorities .
But I do find myself in considerable agreement with the Iranian president 's analysis of why the Middle East peace process has stalled .
He told Gonzales and Goodman : The first reason is that none of the solutions have actually addressed the root cause of the problem .
The root cause is the presence of an illegitimate government regime that has usurped and imposed itself on , meaning they have brought people from other parts of the world , replaced them with people who had existed in the territory and then forced the exit of the old people out , the people who lived there , out of the country or the territories .
So there have been two simultaneous displacements .
The indigenous people were forced out and displaced , and a group of other people scattered around the globe were gathered and placed in a new place ...
A second reason is that none of those peace plans offered so far have given attention to the right to self - determination of the Palestinians .
If a group of people are forced out of their country , that does n't mean their rights are gone , even with the passage of 60 years .
Can you ignore the rights of those displaced ?
How is it possible for people to arrive from far - off lands and have the right to self - determination , whereas the indigenous people of the territory are denied that right ?
Much as I loathe his regime , Ahmadinejad is basically right .
The key to peace in the Middle East is concessions from the occupying power .
As the stronger , wealthier and conquering partner , Israel should take the initiative and help kick - start the peace process by withdrawing unilaterally and totally from the territories it has occupied illegally ( according to international law ) since the 1967 war .
This means pulling out from all of the West Bank and dismantling all the illegal Israeli settlements .
The West Bank , plus Gaza , should become the independent , sovereign state of Palestine , backed with international aid and investment to create the infrastructure for economic development and for social provision ( new houses , schools , hospitals , transport links and sports facilities ) .
Jobs and prosperity in Palestine will undercut and isolate the men of violence .
They will lose support and become marginalised in a self - governing state where ordinary Palestinians experience the tangible benefits of peace .
This is so damn obvious .
When will Israel 's leaders wake up and realise that peace with justice is the only way to give their people lasting security ?"
2008-10-05,"The Bush administration has given a US thinktank the go - ahead to open an office in Iran , in a departure from its strict policy of isolating the Islamic regime .
Clearance was given to the American - Iranian Council amid reports that the White House has shelved plans to open a de facto embassy in Tehran .
There was concern that it could affect the US presidential election in being seen as a reward for Iran 's hawkish president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who has defied UN demands to suspend the country 's uranium enrichment programme .
The council , a body of academics and former diplomats based in Princeton , New Jersey , was granted a one - year licence by the US treasury 's office of foreign assets control , which scrutinises American contacts with Iran for breaches of government - sponsored sanctions .
Ahmadinejad is understood to have indicated support when he met the council 's senior members while in New York last month to attend the UN general assembly .
The council , which was founded in 1997 , has arranged for prominent American academics and business figures to meet Ahmadinejad during his various visits to the US .
Its president , Hooshang Amirahmadi - a joint US - Iranian citizen - is currently in Tehran seeking authorisation from Iranian officials .
A final decision is expected in the coming days , with hardliners voicing opposition .
Alaeddin Boroujerdi , chairman of the Iranian parliament 's national security and foreign policy committee , yesterday called for the application to be rejected after dismissing Amirahmadi as an "" insignificant representative "" of the US government . ""
The Americans have already asked for dialogue on several levels , but this has not been accomplished because of their stances , so permitting such a person to open a bureau in Tehran does not accord with our national interests , "" he told the student news agency , ISNA .
The council argues that its initiative would ease contacts between officials and legislators and could eventually lead to normalised relations between the two countries .
Brent Lollis , its executive director , said the application was separate from the US state department 's proposal to open a diplomatic interests section in Tehran .
"" It 's important to communicate the distinction between what the US government is doing and what we are doing , "" he said .
"" Are we going to provide services that will be useful to diplomats and legislators ?
Yes .
But we are not a substitute [ for a diplomatic interests section ] because the state department makes its own decision .
We should be able to operate in Iran in the same way as we operate in the US . ""
By being based in Tehran , we should be able to arrange a wider array of meetings .
We are positioning ourselves to help any parties that may want to speak to each other . ""
Plans for a US special interest section in Tehran were disclosed by the Guardian last July in what would mark the first American diplomatic presence in Iran since ties were severed in the wake of the 1979 Islamic revolution .
However , that proposal has been thrown into doubt after AP , citing unnamed Bush administration officials , reported that it had been put on hold until the next US president takes office .
The US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , said the proposal remained on the table but that no decision had been taken .
"" I think it 's an interesting idea , but we 're going to take a look at it in the light of what it can do for our relationship with the Iranian people , "" she told reporters ."

2008-10-12,"Merchants shut shops in protest over sales tax Merchants in Tehran 's main market shut their shops yesterday in protest at a new 3 % sales tax , despite the government promising to suspend it for two months .

2008-10-23,"He is renowned for his long hours , hectic schedule and workaholic habits but the stress of high office may be taking its toll on Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and jeopardising his political future .
Speculation about the hyperactive leader 's health was prompted this week after a keynote speech to the state statistics and planning body was cancelled at the last minute and a cabinet meeting took place without him .
A speech to a martyr 's commemoration event was also called off .
A senior aide , Amir Mansour Borghei , told journalists the president was "" indisposed "" .
It has triggered rumours that Ahmadinejad , 52 , is suffering from a long - term illness that may stop him running for re - election next year .
Shahab , the Iranian news website , reported that this week 's events were the latest in a series of cancellations and said the president had previously pulled out of engagements because of listlessness caused by low blood pressure .
In May Ahmadinejad pulled out of events in three consecutive weeks , including a high - profile rally in Golestan province where he was due to meet voters face - to - face .
Aides said he had an overcrowded schedule .
Citing "" sources close to the government "" , Shahab said doctors had advised the president to cut his workload to reduce the possibility of illness .
There is little sign he has heeded any such advice : yesterday 's cancellation came after Ahmadinejad had returned to Tehran from a visit to the Asalouyeh oil and gas project in southern Iran .
The reports will be a blow to the pride of a leader who revels in his energetic style and is known for micro - managing government affairs .
They come at a time when Ahmadinejad is wrestling with acute political problems including near 30 % inflation , rising unemployment , plummeting global oil prices , a market trader strike over plans to impose VAT and demands for the resignation of his interior minister , Ali Kordan , for falsely telling MPs he had an Oxford University degree .
More worrying is that the rumours appear to have given Ahmadinejad 's critics a new stick to beat him with .
Fellow hardliners in Iran 's so - called principalist , or fundamentalist , camp are calling for the president to withdraw from the forthcoming presidential election unless doubts over his health are cleared up .
Issa Saharkhiz , an Iranian political analyst , said the reports could have been fanned by opponents , including the Tehran mayor , Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf , who are preparing to run against the president .
"" I 'm not sure if these health problems are permanent or just a result of tiredness , "" Saharkhiz told the Guardian . ""
But some groups , mainly moderate conservatives , may be thinking that they have found a political solution for eliminating him from the nomination for the elections .

2008-10-27,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has fallen ill due to exhaustion brought on by his heavy workload , a close associate has told the Iranian state news agency .
The announcement comes as doubts have surfaced over whether Ahmadinejad will seek re - election next year .
MP Mohammad Ismail Kowsari , an ally of the president , said on Saturday that Ahmadinejad was feeling under the weather because of the strain of his position , according to the news agency , IRNA . ""
The president will eventually get well and continue his job , "" said Kowsari , who accompanied Ahmadinejad on his visit last month to the UN general assembly .
"" Every human being can face exhaustion under such a workload . ""
He gave no further details about the state of the president 's health .
Ahmadinejad , who rarely misses meetings and public appearances , cancelled a speech on Wednesday at a conference and did not appear at a Cabinet meeting the same day .
But the president , who turns 53 today , did attend a religious ceremony on Saturday in Tehran , though he looked tired as he greeted supporters .
In recent weeks , some of his supporters have been discussing potential candidates for the June 2009 election , implying that the sitting president is not their automatic choice .
However , Kowsari accused opponents of using Ahmadinejad 's illness as an excuse to spread rumours about whether he will run for a second term .
"" Those who use such a natural issue for psychological warfare will fail to gain support in public opinion , "" he said .
No other details about Ahmadinejad 's illness were immediately available .
Since the 1979 Islamic revolution , every Iranian president has been re - elected for a second term , except the first incumbent , Abolhassan Banisadr , who fled the country in 1981 .
The months ahead are critical for Ahmadinejad if he wants to try to rebuild his political base and rebut critics who point to his unfulfilled campaign promises , including extending Iran 's oil revenues to poorer provinces around the country .
With more than 10 % unemployment and 30 % inflation , Iran was unable to reap the benefits from record - high oil prices earlier this year .
Criticism over his management of the country has increasingly come from his erstwhile conservative backers .
Ahmadinejad is also confronting questions about his uncompromising stance with the west over Iran 's nuclear plans , which has severely soured international relations .
The UN has placed sanctions against Iran three times since Ahmadinejad took office in 2005 , over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment ."
2008-11-04,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the Iranian president , suffered a serious blow today when Iran 's parliament sacked his interior minister after he was caught out with a badly faked law degree from Oxford University .
Ali Kordan , a powerful figure on Iran 's complex political scene , was told by the Iranian parliament , the Majlis , that he must face impeachment after he also admitted trying to bribe MPs not to proceed against him .
The president 's backing for the beleaguered minister until the eve of the vote has tarnished his reputation as a fighter against corruption .
"" This is a serious setback to Ahmadinejad and a triumph for parliament , "" Sadegh Zibakalam , a Tehran University political scientist , told the Guardian . ""
In the past he has treated this Majlis with contempt , or as a rubber stamp .
This is a boost to its morale . ""
Kordan 's job included domestic security as well as organising next summer 's presidential elections , when the hardline Ahmadinejad is expected to stand for a second term .
The vote suggests the president 's chances of winning again may be diminishing .
Ali Larijani , the parliamentary speaker , said 188 deputies among the 247 present in the 290-member assembly voted to sack Kordan . ""
The impeachment was approved by parliament and he can not be interior minister from now on , "" he added .
Kordan , a former revolutionary guard , accused the media of a smear campaign by portraying him as a "" terrorist , "" naming Israel Radio and Persian - language media based outside Iran .
The Kordan saga began in August when parliament , which vets ministerial appointments , voted on his confirmation .
When MPs questioned his eligibility he produced a certificate purporting to be an "" honorary doctorate of law "" from Oxford University and was approved by a slim margin .
Within days Iranian journalists were following up claims that the degree was bogus .
Kordan released a copy of the document to quell speculation .
But Alef , a website associated with one of Ahmadinejad 's critics , pointed to typing errors , garbled English and misspellings , purportedly signed by three Oxford professors .
The certificate commended Kordan for "" preparing educational materials "" and for "" research in the domain of comparative law that has opened a new chapter not only in our university but , to our knowledge , this country "" .
Alef passed the certificate to Oxford , which disavowed it .
The Iranian government then blocked Alef 's website from the internet .
It also transpired later that Kordan did not receive a bachelor 's degree or master 's degree from Iran 's Open University , as he had claimed .
Ahmadinejad defended him by saying he should not be judged on a "" piece of torn paper "" , a phrase he has used to dismiss UN resolutions against Iran 's nuclear programme .
One MP commented that the president could have won millions of votes by simply dismissing Kordan and that his support for the minister would cost him those votes next summer . ""
Ahmadinejad is becoming more and more vulnerable , "" said commentator Saeed Leylaz .
"" The vote showed that the prospect of winning the next election is dim for him . ""
Ahmadinejad , president since 2005 , is notorious in the west for his comments on Israel and the Nazi Holocaust .
But most Iranians care more about the economic incompetence he has demonstrated in recent months .
Declining oil revenues have exposed his populist spending plans and left the state coffers all but empty .
In July he predicted oil prices would never fall below $ 100 per barrel .
Prices today were around $ 63 a barrel .
Last week the Tehran stock market plunged 12 % to its lowest close in years .
Inflation is estimated at 27 % or more .
Analysts and diplomats say a key question over the coming months will be the attitude of Iran 's unelected supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who sits at the apex of the political system and has so far backed the president .

2008-11-05,"Iranians reacted positively to Barack Obama 's election , saluting the choice of the American people in breaking with George Bush 's policies and hoping - despite years of deep mutual mistrust - for better relations between Tehran and Washington .
The US and Iran have been locked in hostility for nearly three decades and are at odds over the Islamic Republic 's nuclear ambitions , its support for groups like Hizbullah and Hamas and comments by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad about Israel and the Holocaust .
Passersby canvassed by the Guardian on Valiasr Avenue , Tehran 's longest thoroughfare , were overwhelmingly pleased with the result and cautiously optimistic about the future .

"" From now on the US will not look at other nations as second class , "" he said .
"" Now it will probably set aside its domineering policies .
This is what we hope as a third world and Islamic country .
I hope for a meeting between the supreme leader and Obama , but only if the US accepts our values .

2008-11-07,"The praise for Barack Obama came from all over the world yesterday , but two well - wishers stood out : Italy 's prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and Iran 's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
"" I hope you will prefer real public interests and justice to the never - ending demands of a selfish minority , and seize the opportunity to serve people so that you will be remembered with high esteem , "" Ahmadinejad said , according to the English website of Irna , the official Iranian news agency .
Berlusconi , meanwhile , said the first African - American elected president is "" young , handsome and even tanned "" .
Speaking at a Moscow news conference , Berlusconi appeared to be joking , according to the AP .
But Italian news agencies said later that Berlusconi defended the remark , calling it a compliment and an endearment .
Italian centre - left opposition leader Walter Veltroni said the words "" wound Italy 's dignity "" ."
2008-11-08,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took his time to respond to Barack Obama 's victory , but when he finally did , he sent a clear signal that he would like to see some kind of relationship between Iran and the United States - if there are "" fundamental and fair "" changes from Washington .
Ahmadinejad 's letter was a characteristic jumble of political and moral hectoring - though still an unmistakable attempt to talk to the next US president in a way that was not possible with George Bush , who famously included Iran in his post - September 11 "" axis of evil "" .
"" I would like to offer my congratulations on your election by the majority of the American electorate , "" he wrote .
It was the first time an Iranian president has sent such a message since the 1979 Islamic Revolution ushered in a period of bitter mutual hostility .
Since then , goodwill gestures to the "" Great Satan "" have not been on the agenda in Tehran . ""
The great Iranian nation welcomes real , fundamental and fair changes in behaviour and policies , especially in this region , "" Ahmadinejad wrote to Obama .
"" You are generally expected to make a fast and clear response to demands for change in US domestic and foreign policy which all people in the world , and Americans , want on top of your agenda . ""
"" People expect war - oriented policies , occupation , bullying , deception , intimidation of nations and discriminatory policies ... to be replaced by ones advocating justice , respect for human rights , friendship and non - interference in other countries ' affairs . ""
It was a coincidence that the message was published just as the Bush administration announced new measures stopping US banks from processing transactions by foreign banks that involve Iran .
But that was a timely reminder of their confrontation over Iran 's nuclear ambitions , the Middle East - and also of enduring political realities in Washington .
November 3 , the day before Obama 's triumph , saw the annual celebrations of the takeover of the US embassy in Tehran in 1979 , with carefully marshalled crowds outside the "" nest of spies "" waving banners and chanting "" Death to America "" .
That reflected the unbending line set by Iran 's "" supreme leader "" , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who stands at the apex of the Islamic Republic 's political system and calls the shots on all key issues .
Analysts note that while he has not said "" never "" to better relations with the US , he has cautioned that differences between the two countries are "" deep - seated "" .
Much hinges on what happens in next June 's presidential election in Iran .
Attention is focused on whether the popular reformist and former president Mohammed Khatemi will stand again - and whether he could beat Ahmadinejad , who is now under heavy fire for his economic mismanagement .
Obama may decide to wait and see what happens in June rather than "" reward "" Ahmadinejad with some positive overture .
Yet some Iranians advise immediate action .
"" Obama should use this government to break the taboo of direct negotiations , "" urged one Khatemi ally .
"" For such a big step you need the troublemakers to be silent .
Start with them .
That would be smart , but very difficult . ""
Sadegh Zibakalam , a political scientist at Tehran University , is deeply pessimistic about the prospects .
"" The Supreme Leader believes in a universal crusade against the United States , "" he said .
"" Even if the Americans say ' we do n't mind if you develop an atomic bomb , or arm Hizbullah and Hamas , and we do n't care what you do in Iraq or Afghanistan ' , Iran would still demand more - that the US must apologise for past mistakes and for infringing Iran 's rights . ""
To wage war against the US is a cardinal pillar of the Supreme Leader 's ideology .
If there are normalised relations between Iran and the Great Satan , what will be left for him to say ?
Can he say the economy has improved , that Iran is more Islamic than it was 30 years ago , that people are happy ?
In a sense he needs conflict with the Americans .
"" Nothing significant is likely to happen until the Obama adminstration is up and running in January .
Still , close attention will be paid to the idea - already floated by the Bush team - that the US might seek to open a diplomatic interests section in Tehran , inside the Swiss embassy , as a token of future intentions .
If a move of that kind were to clarify to Tehran that all the US now wants is a change of Iranian behaviour , not the change of regime Iranians say they fear , then more letters from Ahmadinejad could be winging their way to the new man in the White House ."

After all , given his commitment to talk with his enemies , Obama could have been chatting with Kim Jong Il or Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , neither of whom has insulted him or ripped up the constitution recently .
But Obama is savvy enough to realise that whatever his thoughts on the man , he has to make nice to the office .
By all accounts , Bush is a sociable sort of guy , and as long as the conversation did not stray too into nuance - what type of dog to get was probably safe - it should have been easy .
Despite the ugly overtones of the election , the man who appointed Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice is clearly no visceral racist himself , even if his campaigns happily conjured up the ghosts of the Ku Klux Klan .
Indeed , given the bitterness of sectarian Republican politics , which is now as inherently schismatic as the Leninist left , it is quite possible that Bush was actually quite glad to see John McCain get his comeuppance .
After all , it does not do much for a guy 's ego when his party 's successor attempts to bury him alive and out of sight for the duration of the election .
There are probably some denunciations of Obama for accepting Bush 's hospitality already prepared .
However , the constitutional whiz kid from Harvard is doing the right thing in subtly underlining the years of Republican denial of election results .
There is , as he says , only one president at a time .
For decades now , the conservatives in the Republican party have had difficulty accepting the idea of a "" loyal government "" when Democrats won elections .
Most memorably , they never accepted Bill Clinton as president , regardless of mere details like elections .
Obama 's acceptance of Bush 's proffered hand has no downside .
It does not commit him to anything , let alone to continuing his policies .
On the contrary , for those Americans still hoping the Minutemen or Nathan Bedford Forrest will come and rescue them from their living nightmare , the Bush handoff sends a signal that it is all over .
So , dignity should be the watchword for Obama .
When the Clinton family left the White House , the rabid Republican interns rushed in and began counting the spoons .
Obama 's team does not have to stoop to that .
Bush is a manifest failure and falls down on his own record without embellishment of any kind from the victor .
Now that he has done the barely necessary honours , Obama can continue , without personal malice , to undo the executive work of eight years of the worst president out the 43 variously talented previous occupants of the office .
It seems that he has been preparing his agenda and can , at the dash of a pen , undo some of the substantial damage his host today has done .
Much better to reach for the presidential pen to sign away all those regressive executive orders than an ostentatious wipe with a sanitising tissue after today 's handshake ."
2008-11-20,"Iran is the second largest Opec oil producer and already feeling the pain of declining prices more than any other in the Middle East .
Its "" rainy day "" oil stabilisation fund , used to release profits when revenues decline , is reportedly badly depleted as a result of mismanagement by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's government .
The precise figure is a state secret , but a member of parliament revealed recently it was $ 7bn - just enough to cover one year of imported petrol .
Ahmadinejad has seen two central bank governors resign and faces daily criticism of his policies .
A strike by the powerful "" bazaari "" class over a new VAT tax - which would have aggravated inflation already at nearly 30 % - was seen as a warning .
Iran is especially vulnerable because 80 % of its revenue comes from oil .
The IMF calculated recently that for Iran to balance its budget , the price of crude oil must not fall below $ 95 a barrel .
With prices now below $ 50 the shortfall could be staggering .
The effect of declining oil prices will be felt both domestically and internationally .
Ahmadinejad is expected to stand for a second presidential term next June but the lack of cash will restrict his plans to replace subsidies with direct cash payments - widely seen as a vote - buying tactic .
US and UN sanctions imposed over the nuclear issue are already limiting Iran 's ability to issue letters of credit and thus increasing its cost of trade .
Saudi Arabia has been happy to use high Opec production levels and low prices to contain Tehran 's plans for regional hegemony .
US experts and lobbyists now talk openly of exploiting the drop in oil prices to make the sanctions more effective ."
2008-11-25,"With the price of oil falling dramatically , and the prospect of a more moderate administration in Washington , how will Iran 's theocratic government cope ?
Ian Black , the Guardian 's Middle East editor , discusses the political problems facing Iran 's hardline president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , with Jim Falzarano .
According to a US National Intelligence Council report , the year 2025 will mark the end of America 's global dominance .
Julian Borger , the Guardian 's diplomatic editor , talks about the kind of unstable world that the report envisions .
Rory Carroll , the Guardian 's Latin America correspondent , talks to Jon Dennis about how Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez fared in national elections .
The Guardian 's business editor , Deborah Hargreaves , worries that the current recession shows signs of becoming something much more malign .
Finally , science correspondent Ian Sample describes his visit to the new Darwin exhibition at London 's Natural History Museum - marking the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin ."
2008-12-01,"For nearly 30 years its distinctive chequered pattern has been a sacrosanct symbol of Iran 's Islamic revolution and an essential garment for its most committed adherents .
But now the chafiyeh , the black - and - white scarf proudly worn by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his loyal followers , has become an unlikely fashion item for young Iranians drawn to the same western pop culture that country 's leaders disdain .
The scarf has become a craze among Iran 's emerging crop of underground rap artists , who have taken to wearing it in concerts and video clips , according to Jahan News , a website considered close to Iran 's intelligence ministry .
It has also become a trend among young men , who wear it along with T - shirts incongruously bearing the names of famous western bands .
Young women have also been seen with the scarf , Jahan News reported .
Its new - found acceptability was demonstrated in a recent edition of a popular cinema magazine , which carried an advert placed by an Iranian leatherwear company showing a model wearing a bomber jacket with a chafiyeh tucked underneath .
The scarf 's popularity with rappers is particularly ironic .
Last year , Iran 's culture and Islamic guidance ministry announced a campaign against rap music , which it deemed vulgar and obscene .
Rap has become increasingly popular with young Iranians , who have been inspired by the work of artists among the large Iranian exile community in Los Angeles .
The genre has been used to express concerns about drugs , street gangs and even western pressure on Iran over its nuclear programme .
The links with rap are far removed from the chafiyeh 's origins .
After being worn by many Iranian soldiers in the 1980 - 88 war with Iraq , it was adopted as the symbol of "" the sacred defence "" , as the war effort is officially called .
Volunteers used the garments as prayer mats and to protect their faces from chemical attacks .
They were also deployed as burial shrouds and sometimes to tie the hands of captured enemy soldiers .
Nowadays , Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , wears it in all his public appearances .
It is also worn by members of the hardline Basij militia .
Visiting foreign dignitaries , including the Venezuelan president , Hugo Chávez , have also donned the scarf .
Last year , Nicaragua 's president , Daniel Ortega , was greeted with shouts of "" Allahu Akbar "" when he put on a chafiyeh during a ceremony at Tehran University ."
2008-12-12,"Appearing on Sean Hannity 's Fox television programme last week to promote his new book , popular Christian minister and best - selling author Rick Warren made a brief , if regrettable , foray into foreign policy .
Speaking about Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Hannity declared "" we need to take him out "" .
Then he asked Warren whether he was "" advocating something dark , evil or something righteous ? ""
Amazingly , Warren affirmed Hannity 's wrath , saying that stopping evil "" is the legitimate role of government .
The Bible says that God puts government on earth to punish evildoers "" .
Since the publication of his book The Purpose Driven Life in 2002 , Warren has become a celebrity pastor .
His fame went into overdrive in August 2008 when he hosted the two US presidential candidates at the Saddleback Civil Forum at his mega - church in Lake Forest , California .
Over the course of two televised hours , Warren sat separately with Barack Obama and John McCain , asking them a series of identical questions about their faith and how it influenced their politics .
In the ensuing media coverage , it was obvious that there was one clear winner to emerge from the event : Rick Warren .
His face adorned numerous magazine covers , accompanied by profiles inside .
His status vastly increased .
That 's why it 's alarming to hear Warren deploying his spiritual influence in support of the ultranationalist ravings of someone like Sean Hannity .
I contacted Warren 's office for clarification about his statement , to find out where exactly the Bible says that "" God puts government on earth to punish evildoers "" like Ahmadinejad .
I suspected that Warren was referring to Romans 13 , which his office confirmed .
But Romans 13 concerns the power of civil government to punish criminals , and has nothing to do , as far as I know , with invading foreign countries or assassinating foreign leaders .
In the years since the 9/11 attacks , Americans have been inundated with a steady stream of images and quotes from Osama bin Laden and other Islamic extremists offering religious justification for violence .
Many have asked why more moderate Muslims have n't publicly condemned the misuse of their faith to justify war and murder .
Warren 's statement provides an opportunity , and a challenge , to American Christians to do the same .
Here we have one of America 's most famous television pundits asking one of America 's most prominent religious figures whether it was "" righteous "" to kill a foreign leader , and the pastor responded that yes , there was scriptural basis to do this .
The response thus far , apart from a few blog posts , has been slight .
This is unfortunate , as I think the Hannity - Warren exchange reveals the essence of fundamentalism , the idea that one is privy to the intentions of God , and that one has been empowered as an instrument of God 's will .
Needless to say , this is dangerous .
Fundamentalism allows no compromise , which is the essence of politics .
While faith can be an important informant of values , looking to scripture as a road map for – or worse , a sanctification of – policy is a dead end .
If one continues reading in Romans 13 , past the bit about the "" evildoers "" , one comes to the key admonition of the Christian faith : "" Love your neighbour as yourself . ""
What application does this passage have for US foreign policy ?
What does it suggest in regards to US efforts to deal with the Iran 's nuclear programme ?
Aside from reminding us to recognise the intrinsic worth of other human beings – including Ahmadinejad – nothing , really .
Warren 's work – like the work of ministers , priests , rabbis , and imams all over the world – has provided comfort and relief to millions .
But when he offers his blessing to Hannity 's hate , he does a disservice to his message and his faith .
He also gives ammunition to extremists , here and abroad , who posit a war of civilisations between Islam and the west .
I think God would be against that ."
2008-12-24,"Channel 4 has opted to end the year on a controversial note by inviting the president of Iran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , to give the broadcaster 's alternative Christmas message tomorrow .
But the channel has shied away from scheduling the president 's address against the Queen 's Christmas speech at 3 pm .
Unlike most years , it is not airing its alternative Christmas message at the same time as the Queen , but is instead scheduling Ahmadinejad 's message at 7.15pm .
Channel 4 has said that the Muslim president , who has a hostile relationship with many western countries , will deliver a spiritual address that will feature a message of seasonal goodwill .
It will be preceded by a short introduction designed to place his speech in context , the broadcaster added .
Ahmadinejad will argue that the world is in its current predicament because people have lost spiritual faith .
He will also make thinly veiled criticisms of western powers in a reference to the "" tyrannical policies of prevailing global economic and political systems "" .
"" If Christ was on earth today undoubtedly he would stand with the people in opposition to bullying , ill - tempered and expansionist powers , "" he will say .
"" If Christ was on earth today undoubtedly he would hoist the banner of justice and love for humanity to oppose warmongers , occupiers , terrorists and bullies the world over . ""
If Christ was on earth today undoubtedly he would fight against the tyrannical policies of prevailing global economic and political systems , as he did in his lifetime , "" he will say .
"" The solution to today 's problems can be found in a return to the call of the divine prophets . ""
The Channel 4 head of news and current affairs , Dorothy Byrne , argued that the selection of such controversial figure was in line with the broadcaster 's policy of providing an "" alternative world view "" and reflected the extensive coverage it has given to Iran in recent times . ""
As the leader of one of the most powerful states in the Middle East , President Ahmadinejad 's views are enormously influential , "" she said .
"" As we approach a critical time in international relations , we are offering our viewers an insight into an alternative world view . ""
Channel 4 has devoted more airtime to examining Iran than any other broadcaster and this message continues a long tradition of offering a different perspective on the world around us . ""
However , when the president makes his address on Christmas night he will speak to a nation more likely to be tuned in to TV shows such as Strictly Come Dancing and Coronation Street .
Since it launched in 1993 , Channel 4 's alternative Christmas message has been delivered by a varied selection of presenters including an injured veteran from the war in Afghanistan , Quentin Crisp , the Reverend Jesse Jackson , Doreen and Neville Lawrence , Genelle Guzman , a 9/11 survivor and The Simpsons .

2008-12-25,"The full translation of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's Christmas message that will be broadcast on Channel 4 tonight : "" In the Name of God the Compassionate , the Merciful . ""
Upon the anniversary of the birth of Jesus , Son of Mary , the Word of God , the Messenger of mercy , I would like to congratulate the followers of Abrahamic faiths , especially the followers of Jesus Christ , and the people of Britain . ""
The Almighty created the universe for human beings and human beings for Himself . ""
He created every human being with the ability to reach the heights of perfection .
He called on man to make every effort to live a good life in this world and to work to achieve his everlasting life . ""
On this difficult and challenging journey of man from dust to the divine , He did not leave humanity to its own devices .
He chose from those He created the most excellent as His Prophets to guide humanity . ""
All Prophets called for the worship of God , for love and brotherhood , for the establishment of justice and for love in human society .
Jesus , the Son of Mary , is the standard - bearer of justice , of love for our fellow human beings , of the fight against tyranny , discrimination and injustice . ""
All the problems that have bedevilled humanity throughout the ages came about because humanity followed an evil path and disregarded the message of the Prophets . ""
Now as human society faces a myriad of problems and a succession of complex crises , the root causes can be found in humanity 's rejection of that message , in particular the indifference of some governments and powers towards the teachings of the divine Prophets , especially those of Jesus Christ . ""
The crises in society , the family , morality , politics , security and the economy which have made life hard for humanity and continue to put great pressure on all nations have come about because the Prophets have been forgotten , the Almighty has been forgotten and some leaders are estranged from God . ""
If Christ were on earth today , undoubtedly He would stand with the people in opposition to bullying , ill - tempered and expansionist powers .
"" If Christ were on earth today , undoubtedly He would hoist the banner of justice and love for humanity to oppose warmongers , occupiers , terrorists and bullies the world over . ""
If Christ were on earth today , undoubtedly He would fight against the tyrannical policies of prevailing global economic and political systems , as He did in His lifetime . ""
The solution to today 's problems is a return to the call of the divine Prophets .
The solution to these crises is to follow the Prophets - they were sent by the Almighty for the good of humanity . ""
Today , the general will of nations is calling for fundamental change .
This is now taking place .
Demands for change , demands for transformation , demands for a return to human values are fast becoming the foremost demands of the nations of the world . ""
The response to these demands must be real and true .
The prerequisite to this change is a change in goals , intentions and directions .
If tyrannical goals are repackaged in an attractive and deceptive package and imposed on nations again , the people , awakened , will stand up against them . ""
Fortunately , today , as crises and despair multiply , a wave of hope is gathering momentum .
Hope for a brighter future and hope for the establishment of justice , hope for real peace , hope for finding virtuous and pious rulers who love the people and want to serve them – and this is what the Almighty has promised .
"" We believe Jesus Christ will return , together with one of the children of the revered Messenger of Islam and will lead the world to love , brotherhood and justice . ""
The responsibility of all followers of Christ and Abrahamic faiths is to prepare the way for the fulfilment of this divine promise and the arrival of that joyful , shining and wonderful age .
"" I hope that the collective will of nations will unite in the not too distant future and with the grace of the Almighty Lord , that shining age will come to rule the earth . ""
Once again , I congratulate one and all on the anniversary of the birth of Jesus Christ .
I pray for the New Year to be a year of happiness , prosperity , peace and brotherhood for humanity .
I wish you every success and happiness . """
2008-12-25,"The government has criticised Channel 4 's decision to broadcast an alternative Christmas message by the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
A foreign and commonwealth office spokeswoman said today that the move would cause offence around the world . ""
President Ahmadinejad has during his time in office made a series of appalling anti - Semitic statements , "" she said .
"" The British media are rightly free to make their own editorial choices , but this invitation will cause offence and bemusement not just at home but amongst friendly countries abroad . ""
Channel 4 's alternative message , designed as a contrast to the traditional Queen 's speech , has featured a number of leftfield figures in the past but the choice of Ahmadinejad , whose aggressive stance towards Israel and the west - including an alleged attempt to pursue a nuclear weapons programme , has proved particularly controversial .
The speech will be broadcast at 7.15pm , a change from previous years when the alternative message has gone head - to - head with the Queen 's speech , which is screened on BBC and ITV .
In his message , Ahmadinejad expresses his wish for a peaceful New Year .
Speaking in Farsi with English subtitles , he will say : "" Jesus , the Son of Mary , is the standard bearer of justice , of love for our fellow human beings , of the fight against tyranny , discrimination and injustice . ""
If Christ were on earth today , undoubtedly he would stand with the people in opposition to bullying , ill - tempered and expansionist powers .
"" The content of the speech has failed to pacify those angry at the choice of the Iranian president .
Louise Ellman , Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside and chairwoman of the Labour Jewish Movement , accused Channel 4 of giving "" an unchallenged platform to a dangerous fanatic who denies the holocaust while preparing for another and claims homosexuality does not exist while his regime hangs gay young men from cranes in the street "" .
However , Channel 4 received support from Ben Summerskill , the director of the gay rights group Stonewall . ""
In spite of his ridiculous and often offensive views , it is an important way of reminding him that there are some countries where free speech is not repressed , "" he said .
Channel 4 head of news and current affairs
Dorothy Byrne defended tonight 's message as "" an insight into an alternative world view "" . ""
Channel 4 has devoted more airtime to examining Iran than any other broadcaster and this message continues a long tradition of offering a different perspective on the world around us , "" she said .

This article was amended on Monday December 29 2008 .
In the article above we misquoted a Foreign Office spokeswoman as saying the invitation to President Ahmadinejad would cause amusement , when she said it would cause bemusement .
This has been amended ."
2008-12-27,"A couple of Christmases ago I spent five weeks in a small town in Virginia .
I used to tune in once in a while to the fringe Christian TV stations .
I did n't follow the big musical production - style services , with their cast of thousands , choirs and dynamic preachers ; I was fascinated by the shows which featured a single fellow in a suit , drily explaining how the Bible predicted this or that current world event , and how it fitted in with the narrative of the coming Armageddon , the second coming of Christ and the rapturing of the American faithful to heaven in a divine liposuctory slurp .
I did n't expect Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the president of Iran , to remind me of those Bible prophecy pundits in his Channel 4 Christmas Day broadcast .
But amid Ahmadinejad 's phoney what - would - Jesus - do pieties - stand up against the stoning of women to death for adultery , no , Mahmoud ?
- there was an unexpected snippet : support for the anticipation , much more widespread in the United States than here , of the second coming .
"" We believe Jesus Christ will return , together with one of the children of the revered Messenger of Islam and will lead the world to love , brotherhood and justice , "" he said .
"" The responsibility of all followers of Christ and Abrahamic faiths is to prepare the way for the fulfilment of this divine promise and the arrival of that joyful , shining and wonderful age . ""
Bundling the second coming of Christ together with the mainstream Shia Muslim belief in the emergence from hiding of a messianic Imam was a sly reference on the president 's part .
If the polls do n't lie , most Americans believe in a version of divine transformation that is similar to Ahmadinejad 's , except that it is darker and more chauvinistic .
Millions of fundamentalist American Christians , as well as some in this country , sincerely believe in the imminence of the "" end times "" , when good evangelical Christians will be whisked off to heaven , titanic battles with the Antichrist will take place in Israel , Jesus will return and all non - Christians - atheists like myself , Jews , Muslims , Buddhists - will be consigned to eternal damnation in the bad fire .
For such Christian fundamentalists , who believe the Bible is an exact guide to the future , the possibility that Iran might attack Israel or that Israel or the United States might attack Iran is tremendously exciting , because it seems to bring the end times closer .
I was sceptical , then , about the indignation from the likes of the Foreign Office and the Jerusalem Post towards Channel 4 for giving the Iranian president a pulpit on Christmas Day .
True , he is part of a nasty regime , and he has called for Israel 's destruction .
But , quite apart from the fact he has neither the means nor the authority to destroy Israel , I 'd be as interested to hear his unvarnished take on the world as I was to listen to the unmediated ravings of the likes of America 's internationally televised Pastor John Hagee , the waters of whose fundamentalism mingle in the same noxious river as Ahmadinejad 's .
But at least a Hagee sermon - or one of Ahmadinejad 's speeches when he 's on the stump at home - give you something to get your teeth into .
Just as the infamous Danish Muhammad cartoons fell at the first hurdle - even before they were or were n't offensive , they failed because they were n't funny
- so did the Ahmadinejad address :
even before it was or was n't offensive , it failed because it was n't interesting .
My goodness , was he anodyne , murmuring stiffly away there next to a vase of roses , as if his model was the soporific sermonizing of the Ayatollah Khomeini , a staple of late night Iranian TV .
As little as the Christmas message told us about Ahmadinejad or Iran , it told us something about Channel 4 - about how they 've yielded to the phenomenon of double - hyping , where a celebrity and his critics share an interest in exaggerating the celebrity 's importance .
Last year , when Ahmadinejad was invited by Columbia University in New York to address its World Leaders ' Forum , there were mass protests outside .
Lee Bollinger , the university 's president , introduced Ahmadinejad with a stirring defence of the rights of free speech , or , as he put it , "" the genius of the American idea of free speech "" which "" asks us to exercise extraordinary self - restraint against the very natural but often counter - productive impulses that lead us to retreat from engagement with ideas we dislike and fear . ""
Then , without giving Ahmadinejad a chance to speak , he launched into a 1,500-word denunciation of the Iranian , calling him "" a petty and cruel dictator "" .
Apart from being the hospitality equivalent of shooting the guy with the white flag during a truce , Bollinger 's fear of letting his students judge Ahmadinejad for themselves was an important part of the double - hyping of the Iranian president into an American - Euro hate figure out of all proportion to his significance , a hyping that Channel 4 bought into . ""
In referring to him as a dictator , "" the Iranian - American writer Reza Aslan said after the Columbia episode , "" you 're giving this man far more credit than he actually deserves .
This is a completely powerless person .
He 's not in charge of the army , he 's barely in charge of the budget , he makes no foreign policy decisions whatsoever , he 's not part of the intelligence apparatus in Iran , he ca n't suggest or pass any laws . ""
Channel 4 's alternative Christmas message has often , in the past , been a sort of double opposition to the Queen - not just from somebody putting a counter - establishment point of view , but a non - celebrity ; a wounded Afghan veteran , a 9/11 survivor , Doreen and Neville Lawrence .
If Channel 4 had wanted to put up a leftfield Iranian voice to provoke thought , why not invite Maurice Motamed , the only Jewish member of the Iranian parliament , a voice of Iran 's 25,000 Jews - the second largest Jewish community in the Muslim world - and someone who has spoken out against Ahmadinejad 's Holocaust denial ?
Channel 4 avoided Bollinger 's crassness , only to turn what was becoming a good tradition into another celebrity status game ."
2008-12-27,"Channel 4 handed President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran a propaganda victory when it broadcast his Alternative Christmas Message .
Giving him a prime - time television slot , he was able to pose , unchallenged , as a defender of justice and peace - despite the Iranian regime 's grisly human rights record , which includes the execution of children , women , students , journalists , Sunni Muslims , gay people , political activists and ethnic minorities .
Ahmadinejad 's Christmas Day broadcast was a sick joke .
It was the equivalent of giving a propaganda platform to Tony Blair , Vladimir Putin , Ariel Sharon , Omar al - Bashir , Henry Kissinger , General Than Shwe or George Bush , so they could pose as men of peace and human right defenders .
Whatever next ?
Will President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe be invited to deliver the Alternative Christmas Message next year and be given free rein to whitewash his policies of kidnapping , rape , torture , murder , starvation and disease ?
I have no objection to news coverage of the Iranian President 's views and policies .
As a national leader , what he says and does merits reportage .
But giving him the Christmas message slot , which is prestigious and high - profile , is a step too far .
Apart from this being an honour that he is unworthy of receiving , he was on prime - time television without any exposure of the contradiction between his professed views and his actual policies .
Dorothy Byrne , head of news and current affairs at Channel 4 , justified the decision to broadcast him as follows : "" As the leader of one of the most powerful states in the Middle East , President Ahmadinejad 's views are enormously influential .
As we approach a critical time in international relations , we are offering our viewers an insight into an alternative world view . ""
Really ?
The Iranian President 's message revealed very little about his world view or policies .
It was religious and state propaganda , carefully scripted by the foreign ministry in Tehran .
Ahmadinejad told us what he wanted us to hear .
It was a con – a manufactured message of conciliation , goodwill and moderation deliberately designed to disarm us and to disguise the brutal reality of his regime .
It had echoes of the propagandist newsreels of Joseph Stalin , where he portrayed himself as a kind and much loved leader of the Soviet people .
These are some of the key extracts from Ahmadinejad 's broadcast Christmas message : "" Jesus , the Son of Mary , is the standard bearer of justice , of love for our fellow human beings , of the fight against tyranny , discrimination and injustice …
"" If Christ were on earth today , undoubtedly He would hoist the banner of justice and love for humanity to oppose warmongers , occupiers , terrorists and bullies the world over … "" I pray for the New Year to be a year of happiness , prosperity , peace and brotherhood for humanity . ""
Fine words , shame about the reality .
Ahmadinejad may talk of peace and justice , but his apparently reasonable words are a propagandistic smokescreen .
What counts are not words but actions .
The president 's actions against his own people are devoid of love , mercy , justice , humanity and brotherhood .
They are characterised by the savage repression of all dissenters and nonconformists .
Trade unionists , students , journalists , women 's rights campaigners - even lawyers and human rights defenders - are imprisoned and tortured .
His government is also pursuing a racist , ethnic persecution policy against Iran 's minority nationalities , such as the Arabs , Kurds and Baluchs .
There were no apologies for these crimes against humanity in the president 's broadcast .
If there had been a genuine apology , Channel Four would have been justified in giving him the Christmas slot and I would have supported that decision .
But that is not what happened
and it was never going to happen .
Channel Four has been more than suckered .
It has colluded with a tyrant ; allowing itself to be used to promote the leader a cruel , heartless regime .
What makes it worse is that the whole scenario appears to have to be contrived in a cynical bid to stir controversy and boost ratings .
Rewarding Ahmadinejad with a top place in the Christmas Day schedule is an insult to the estimated 100,000 Iranian dissidents who have been murdered since the Islamic fundamentalists seized power in 1979 .
The channel 's executives would not have given Ahmadinejad this platform if it was their partners or children who were being tortured in Evin prison , Tehran .
This Christmas , thousands of Iranian families are grieving and mourning .
Their loved ones have been jailed , tortured and hanged .
Instead of inviting them to deliver the Alternative Christmas Message , Channel 4 gave airtime to the man responsible for their loved ones ' pain , suffering and death .
According to Human Rights Watch , in March this year an Iranian parliament member , Hossein Ali Shahryari , confirmed that 700 people were awaiting execution in Sistan and Baluchistan province , which is only one of Iran 's 30 provinces .
Many of those on death row are Baluch political prisoners .
This staggering number of death sentences is evidence of the intense , violent repression that is taking place under the leadership of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The regime 's terror is wide - ranging .
Student leader Meisam Lofti was executed last year on false charges of being a gang member .
Members of minority faiths , like the Baha'is and , sometimes , Sunni Muslims , suffer severe harassment .
The regime 's crackdown includes the enforcement of harsh morality laws .
In 2004 , in the city of Neka , a 16-year - old girl , Atefah Rajabi Sahaaleh , who had been raped and sexually abused by men for many years , was convicted of "" crimes against chastity "" .
She was hanged by the method of slow , painful strangulation , hoisted by a crane in a public square .
This strangulation technique , sanctioned by the Iranian president , is deliberately designed to prolong the suffering of the victim .
As you can see here , the hanged person is left dangling and writhing for several minutes before he or she eventually asphyxiates and dies .
Truly barbaric .
Labour activists are also victimised .
Mansour Osanloo , leader of Tehran 's bus workers syndicate , remains in jail – together with other trade unionists .
He was sentenced to five years in July 2007 for his defence of workers ' rights .
Oppressing his own people is not enough for Ahmadinejad .
His regime also exports suffering abroad .
It supports the Hizbullah fundamentalists in Lebanon , who , like Israel , indiscriminately attack civilian areas .
In addition , many of the death squads in Iraq are trained , armed and funded by Tehran .
These include ex - Badr Brigade members who , during the misrule of Saddam Hussein , lived and trained across the border in south - east Iran .
Nowadays , they assassinate political , sexual and religious dissidents ; usually gunning them down in their house , workplace or street .
No trial .
No evidence .
Summary execution , aided by Ahmadinejad 's government .
Despite persecuting the Iranian people and supporting terror groups abroad , Channel Four chose to give a platform to the tyrant of Tehran .
Wrong move .
Instead of putting President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Channel Four , he should be put on trial at The Hague ( along with George Bush and many others ) ."
2009-01-15,"Switzerland has appointed what is believed to be the first female ambassador to Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
Livia Leu Agosti arrived in Iran this week as Berne 's woman in Tehran , drawing criticism from Swiss conservative politicians and pleas for solidarity from Iranian women 's rights campaigners .
She met the Iranian foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , for talks on expanding bilateral economic ties and is expected to present her diplomatic credentials formally to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the coming weeks .
Iran has on occasion rejected ambassadors ' credentials .
The Iranian students ' news agency ISNA , citing "" informed sources "" , said yesterday that Leu Agosti had been accepted by the foreign ministry .
Her appointment puts her in charge of one of the most strategically placed diplomatic missions in Tehran .
The Swiss embassy has represented US interests since 1980 , when Washington severed diplomatic ties with Iran after the takeover of its embassy by Islamist revolutionaries .
Swiss diplomats have frequently acted as a conduit for messages between the two countries .
Leu Agosti , 47 , was head of the Swiss foreign ministry 's Africa and the Middle East department .
The US president - elect , Barack Obama , is expected to explore ways of engaging Iran 's theocratic government .
Leu Agosti told SonntagsZeitung newspaper her appointment struck a blow for "" women 's equality in a man 's world "" .
But Swiss critics claim that her agreement to observe Iran 's laws requiring women to wear the hijab represents surrender to radical Islam .
Switzerland 's foreign minister , Micheline Calmy - Rey , a vocal women 's equality advocate and a member of the Council of Women World Leaders , provoked controversy during a visit to Tehran last year by wearing a headscarf to meet Ahmadinejad .
Exiled Iranian female campaigners have urged Leu Agosti to challenge Iran 's official position that the headscarf is a "" cultural "" issue .
In an open letter to Leu Agosti and Calmy - Rey , the international network of solidarity with the Iranian women 's movement accused the government of practising "" gender - specific apartheid "" against women .
Leu Agosti has said she will wear the hijab to maintain her diplomatic status ."
2009-01-20,"The bearded man 's distinctive features appeared to be instantly recognisable as he stepped off the plane and entered the arrivals hall of Damascus airport - so much so that the Syrian police , taken aback by his presence , sounded a major security alert .
Puzzled as to why they had not been tipped off about the impending arrival of such an important VIP - Iran 's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad - flustered officers swarmed around the familiar figure and tried to usher him to a secluded part of the airport , out of harm 's way and away from the prying eyes of the masses .
The Iranian leader , they believed , must have travelled to Syria on the same kind of unannounced trip he sometimes makes in his native country , where he has been known to attend mourning ceremonies and visit deprived areas without prior notice .
His presence on Syrian soil would not have been entirely surprising , since Syria and Iran are allies .
But only when word reached Iranian passengers newly arrived on a flight from Tehran that their president was in the airport did it became clear that it was a false alarm .
Flocking to the scene for a glimpse of the VIP , they were disappointed to discover that the individual under escort was not Ahmadinejad but a fellow passenger bearing an uncanny resemblance to the leader .
Police released him from their care after being convinced that it was a case of mistaken identity .
There are conflicting reports about the origins of the man , who has not been named .
While some say he is Iranian , a Kuwaiti newspaper , al Siyasa , reported that he is from Bangladesh .
The website Tabnak reported that he had travelled to Syria to pay homage to the tomb of Zeinab , sister of Hosein , a symbol of martyrdom in Iran 's version of Shia Islam .
His likeness to Ahmadinejad had previously been noted , the website added , and a television documentary about his resemblance to the leader had been broadcast ."
2009-01-20,"If Iran 's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , North Korea 's King Jong - il , or Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe were watching Barack Obama 's inauguration address , they might be forgiven for thinking that the following lines , delivered with cool , determined confidence , were directed straight at them :
To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict , or blame their society 's ills on the west – know that your people will judge you on what you can build , not what you destroy .
To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent , know that you are on the wrong side of history , but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist .
There , summed up in a couple of sentences , was the double - edged message that America 's rookie president wanted to convey to those around the world who have suffered most , and raged , defied and taunted the most , during the confrontational Bush years .
The US , under new management , was ready to lead again , was ready to make a fresh start , was prepared to learn from its mistakes , keen to revert , revive and re - base its policies on ageless values handed down from the Founding Fathers .
At the same time , he made plain Obama 's America would be no soft touch , no pushover for those who chose confrontation and violence instead of rapprochement and dialogue .
We will not apologise for our way of life , nor will we waver in its defence , and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents , we say to you now that our spirit is stronger , and can not be broken .
You can not outlast us , and we will defeat you .
Obama 's message to the world was also a message to Americans who have watched , often appalled , as the Bush - Cheney axis subjugated the constitution and civil liberties , at home as well as abroad , to the supposedly paramount , unquestionable cause of an endless , elastic , global "" war on terror "" We reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals ...
Those ideals still light the world , and we will not give them up for expedience 's sake .
And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today , from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born : know that America is a friend of each nation and every man , woman , and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity , and we are ready to lead once more .
Obama went on to castigate his predecessor , without actually naming him , summoning as witness the achievements of previous generations .
They understood that our power alone can not protect us , nor does it entitle us to do as we please .
Instead , they knew that our power grows through its prudent use ; our security emanates from the justness of our cause , the force of our example , the tempering qualities of humility and restraint .
Two pledges – to work to roll back the nuclear threat and counter the spectre of global warming – were particularly welcome after the prevarication and obfuscation of the Bush era .
But there were also evident blind spots .
It is difficult to see quite what Obama meant in pledging to "" forge a hard - earned peace in Afghanistan "" .
His policy , as presently understood , will certainly lead to a military escalation that many professional soldiers ( and Afghans ) fear will only make matters worse .
Perhaps Obama 's most resonant outreach beyond America 's shores was to the lands and peoples of Islam , many of whom became convinced during the Bush presidency that the west had launched a new crusade against them .
He addressed Muslims directly , this man whose middle name is Hussein and was not afraid to use it on the biggest day of his life . ""
To the Muslim world , we seek a new way forward , based on mutual interest and mutual respect , "" he said .
When Obama said the world has changed and we must change with it , he was talking to everyone , not just US citizens .
The word from the White House , at last , was inclusive .
In the face of his example , he suggested the old barriers can not stand – and the change of which he is the symbol belongs to all , if only they will embrace it .
Muslim nations and others will wait to see how , if at all , Inauguration Day 's fine , hope - inspiring words translate into action .
But whatever happens next , it 's good , after eight barren , murderous , divisive years , to once again have an American who knows how to lead ."
2009-01-28,"The US should apologise for "" crimes "" it has committed against Iran if it wants a better relationship with Tehran , the Iranian president said today , after recent overtures to the Muslim world from the new administration in Washington .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's uncompromising tone followed a conciliatory message from Barack Obama , the US president , earlier this week when he told the Islamic world : "" We are not your enemies . ""
In his inauguration last week , Obama offered to extend a hand of peace if Iran "" unclenched its fist "" .
At a rally in western Iran today , broadcast live on national television , Ahmadinejad said Iran would welcome a change in US policy provided it involved a withdrawal of American troops from abroad and an apology to Iran . ""
Those who say they want to make change , this is the change they should make : they should apologise to the Iranian nation and try to make up for their dark background and the crimes they have committed against the Iranian nation , "" he said .
The Iranian leader listed a range of "" crimes "" , such as trying to block what Tehran says is a peaceful nuclear power programme , hindering Iran 's development since the 1979 revolution and other actions by US administrations dating back more than 60 years .
Ahmadinejad had harsh words for George Bush , who he said "" has gone into the trash can of history with a very black and shameful file full of treachery and killings .
He left and , God willing , he will go to hell . ""
In a break with his predecessor , Obama has dangled the prospect of direct talks with Tehran without preconditions .
Susan Rice , the new US ambassador to the United Nations , has pledged "" vigorous "" and "" direct "" nuclear diplomacy with Iran but warned that pressure would increase if it refused to halt uranium enrichment .
Analysts believe Obama 's election offers "" a once - in - a - generation opportunity "" for a new start in relations between Tehran and Washington , which were severed after students seized the US embassy in Tehran and took more than 90 hostages following the 1979 revolution .
"" They will never get a new US president who is as balanced as Obama 's public statements are , who talks about wanting to engage in a respectful way with Iran and who seems less encumbered by the baggage of the past , "" a western diplomat told the Associated Press .
"" It is in Iran 's clear interest to engage . ""
He warned of the risk that hardliners clinging to a "" we're - winning - you're - losing rhetoric "" may prevail .
An Iranian opposition politician , Ebrahim Yazdi , said he did not expect movement on the issue of US relations before June , when Ahmadinejad is expected to seek re - election .
Yazdi said better ties were in Iran 's strategic and economic interest , adding : "" The political atmosphere in Iran is now ripe , is suitable for direct negotiation with the United States . ""
The five permanent members of the UN security council – Britain , China , France , Russia and the US – along with Germany have offered Tehran economic and energy incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment programme , which the west sees as a cover to acquire a nuclear weapons capability .
Tehran is pressing on with the programme , which it says is geared toward electricity generation ."

2009-01-28,"President Barack Obama 's administration is considering sending a letter to Iran aimed at unfreezing US - Iranian relations and opening the way for face - to - face talks , the Guardian has learned .
The US state department has been working on drafts of the letter since Obama was elected on November 4 .
The letter would be in reply to a lengthy one of congratulations sent by the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , on November 6 .
Diplomats say Obama 's letter would be a symbolic gesture to mark a change in tone from the hostile one adopted by the Bush administration , which portrayed Iran as part of an "" axis of evil "" .
It would be intended to allay the suspicions of Iran 's leaders and pave the way for President Obama to engage them directly , a break with past policy .
State department officials have written at least three drafts of a letter that gives assurances that Washington does not want to overthrow the Islamic regime , but merely seek a change in its behaviour .
The letter would be addressed to the Iranian people and sent directly to Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , or released as an open letter .
One draft proposal suggests Iran should compare its relatively low standard of living with that of some of its more prosperous neighbours and contemplate the benefits of losing its pariah status in the West .
Although the tone is conciliatory , it also calls on Iran to end what the US calls state sponsorship of terrorism .
The letter is being considered by the new secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , as part of a sweeping review of US policy on Iran .
A decision on sending it is not expected until the review is complete .
In an interview on Monday with the al - Arabiya television network , Obama hinted at a more friendly approach towards Iran .
The Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said today he was waiting patiently to see what the Obama administration comes up with .
"" We will listen to the statements closely , we will carefully study their actions and if there are real changes , we will welcome it , "" he said .
Ahmadinejad , who confirmed he will stand for election again in June , said it was unclear whether the Obama administration was intent on just a shift in tactics or was seeking fundamental change .
He called on the US to apologise for its actions against Iran over the last 60 years , including US support for a 1953 coup that ousted the democratically - elected government and the US shooting down of an Iranian passenger plane in 1988 .
US concern over Iran is mainly over its uranium enrichment programme , which Washington claims is intended to provide the country with a nuclear weapons capability .
Diplomatic moves are given increased urgency by fears that Israel might take unilateral action to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities .
The state department refused to comment today on options under review .
But diplomatic sources said lots of options were under review about how to signal to the Iranians that there is a change in attitude in Washington and that Obama is looking for direct talks .
One of the chief Iranian concerns revolves around suspicion that the US is engaged in covert actions aimed at regime change , including support for separatist groups in areas like Kurdestan , Sistan - Baluchestan and Khuzestan .
The state department has repeatedly denied there is any US support for such groups .
The Bush administration , in its dying days , was planning to open a US interests section in Tehran , one step down from an embassy .
The former secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , said it never happened because attention was diverted by the Russian invasion of Georgia .
Others say that right - wingers in the Bush administration mounted a rearguard action to block it .
The idea has resurfaced but if there are direct talks with Iran , it may be decided that a diplomatic presence would obviate the need for a diplomatic mission in Tehran , at least in the short term .
While Obama is taking the lead on Iran policy , the administration will shortly announce that Dennis Ross will become a special envoy to Iran , following the appointments last week of George Mitchell , the veteran US mediator , as special envoy to the Middle East and Richard Holbrooke , who helped broker the Bosnia peace agreement , as special envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Ross , who served in the Clinton administration in a leading role in the Middle East peace talks , will be responsible on a day to day basis in implementing Iran policy .
In a graphic sign of Iranian mistrust , the hardline newspaper Kayhan , which is considered close to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has denounced Ross as a "" Zionist lobbyist "" .
Saeed Leylaz , a Tehran - based analyst , said a US letter would have to be accompanied by security guarantees and an agreement to drop economic sanctions .
"" If they send such a letter it will be a very significant step towards better ties but they should be careful in not thinking Tehran will respond immediately , "" he said .
"" There will be disputes inside the system about such a letter .
There are lot of radicals who do n't want to see ordinary relations between Tehran and Washington .
To convince Iran , they should send a very clear message that they are not going to try and destroy the regime . """
2009-01-28,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has responded to Barack Obama 's opening to Iran , and his answer is characteristically acerbic .
Yes , we can talk , he is saying , if you come on your hands and knees .
The Iranian president has never been the go - to world leader for moderate language , and his speech today in Kermanshah , in western Iran , was no exception .
Only "" fundamental "" change from Washington would be enough to reboot bilateral relations after their 30-year freeze , and such change would have to involve a complete withdrawal of US troops from around the world and apologies for past "" crimes "" against Iran .
The ferocity of the response to the sustained overture coming from Washington in the first days of the Obama administration confirms a theory about US - Iran relations : that the hardline establishments in both countries helped sustain each other .
The arrival of a moderate and charismatic voice in the White House is a far greater threat to Ahmadinejad and his chances of getting re - elected in June than George Bush and all the sabres he rattled .
Obama does not trigger the same Persian nationalist response that used to rally Iranians around Ahmadinejad 's government at the prospect of American bombs .
Perhaps more importantly , given the nature of Iranian elections , the arrival of a new soft - talking administration might change the mind of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , about the sort of president he wants to see elected .
The return of the reformist Mohammad Khatami might be too much for Khamenei to stomach , but there are conservative alternatives , such as the parliamentary speaker , Ali Larijani , or Tehran 's mayor , Mohammad - Baqer Qalibaf .
From Washington or any European capital , just about anyone would look like an improvement on Ahmadinejad .
The Iranian presidency does not make nuclear policy , but it both reflects and influences the political mood among Iran 's theocrats and marks the limits of what is possible in negotiations .
Only a few days ago , the coming Iranian elections appeared to present a dilemma for the incoming US administration .
Some diplomats had warned that too friendly an overture too early would strengthen Ahmadinejad by demonstrating to Iranians he could bring America to the negotiating table by pursuing an unwavering hard line .
Ahmadinejad 's speech suggests he is unwilling or incapable of pocketing the political capital he is being offered , and by pushing back at the US he seems likely to further damage himself in the eyes of the Iranian voter and the Khamenei circle .
The Obama administration seems determined to press ahead with its opening to Iran , essentially attempting to untangle the central problem underlying US policy until now : the Bush White House could not make up its mind whether it wanted to overthrow the Tehran regime or force it to change its behaviour .
The regime clearly decided it was the former , and concluded that aggressively pursuing a nuclear programme was its best protection .
After all , the US and its allies had invaded Iraq , which had no WMDs , while North Korea , the third member of the "" axis of evil "" , which actually has nuclear bombs , was treated with more respect .
The question now is whether those dangerous dynamics can be reversed , or whether the momentum of the Iranian nuclear programme is now unstoppable ."
2009-01-28,"It takes time to unpick eight years of mistakes , misanthropy and mutual malice .
But Barack Obama 's tentative first moves down a path that could eventually lead to the normalisation of US relations with Iran carry a historic significance stretching far beyond the barren era of finger - pointing presided over by George Bush and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Almost 30 years to the day when Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlavi , King of Kings , Light of the Aryans , and American client , was overthrown in February 1979 , Obama 's initiative has potential to end one of the most unnecessary , dangerous enmities of recent times .
Ask Iranians if they want to be friends with the US and the answer is usually "" yes "" .
Their invariable , puzzled question in return is : why does America hate us ?
Obama plainly aims to show them and others round the world that hate has no place in his plans .
But his Iran move , like other foreign policy shifts , carries considerable political risks and will be judged by results , not intentions .
At present he can draw on an unusual degree of political capital .
Polls suggest there is wide popular support for change , for making a break with the past .
But even Obama has only so long to deliver .
Honeymoons always end .
If things go wrong in Afghanistan or Lebanon or North Korea , he may quickly be left looking more like dupe than visionary .
Speaking in anticipation of Obama 's overtures , Saeed Jalili , Iran 's national security chief , talked in terms applicable not just to US - Iran relations but to all of Obama 's apparently mould - breaking foreign policy initiatives .
"" What is important for our people now , and which can shape the future of relations and the two sides ' perspective , is what this change of approach will mean in practice , "" Jalili told Iranian state television three days after Obama took office . ""
As has been said many times before , what is being referred to as a change should mean change in action .
"" Action is the key word here .
Obama 's swift plunge into Israel - Palestine conflict , his personal promise , televised directly into the Arab world , to treat Muslims and their leaders with respect , his move to close Guantánamo Bay and turn America 's back on torture , and his instructions to his generals to get out of Iraq have all reinforced the impression of a world suddenly turned on its head .
After the endless conflict and numbing nihilism of the Bush years , it is almost as if America is once again opening itself to the world , is suddenly seeing straight , is becoming itself and in the process , rediscovering its values .
For countless people in countless countries , this development is little short of inspiring .
Even in the desiccated , cynical gaming rooms of foreign policy diplomacy , it is heady stuff .
Yet in all these areas , as on Iran , Obama has yet to deliver the change he stands for , has yet to turn words into meaningful , lasting action .
His supporters say : give him time .
His many foreign interlocutors , opponents and enemies say : give us solid proof that he means what he says .
One of the toughest operators , Russia 's Vladimir Putin , understands this well and is testing Obama .
Today 's indication of a reversal of the plan to deploy missiles in eastern Europe was on the face of it , a friendly gesture .
In reality , Putin appears to be trying to tip Obama 's hand , induce him to abandon Bush 's supposedly vital missile defence project .
Other tests by other leaders surely await .
Like so much else , Obama has yet to make up his mind on missile defence .
The issue is officially under review .
This also applies to Middle East policy .
Criticised before his inauguration for failing to speak out about Israel 's attack on Gaza , the president - elect said he would have plenty to say once in office .
In the event he has largely remained silent , avoiding the subject in this week 's al - Arabiya interview .
Obama 's Middle East envoy , George Mitchell , criss - crossing the region this week , is making all the normal courtesy calls .
But in line with Bush administration thinking , he will not meet Hamas leaders .
Maybe that will come later .
But so far secretary of state Hillary Clinton is sounding no less hostile to the idea than did Bush 's hand - maiden , Condoleezza Rice .
A week into his presidency the untried Obama has made a powerful , courageous start on the international stage .
But as chief executives the world over have discovered before him , managing change successfully is an immensely daunting task .
It all comes down to doing .
And it often does n't work out the way you intend ."
2009-01-29,"OBAMA 'S HISTORIC MOVE OVER IRAN
Amid the economic stimulus plans and climate change missives , come reports this morning of a new level of diplomacy between US and Iran , in the form of a letter currently being drafted by Barack Obama 's administration in an attempt to pave the way for direct engagement .
The Guardian splashes on the exclusive story , which says that the letter will be a response to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's lengthy dissertation to the President sent the day after he was elected .
The letter , which is thought to be conciliatory in tone , is intended to symbolise a break away from Bush 's assertions that Iran was part of an ' ' axis of evil '' but will also call on Iran to end what the US calls sponsorship of terrorism .
In an analysis of the move , Simon Tisdall , the Guardian 's foreign affairs columnist , says it is of huge historic importance .

UK IN DEEPEST RECESSION
Accompanied by a melodramatic black and white picture of St Paul 's during the blitz , the Times announces today that the last time the economy was this bad was back during a period of ' ' rationing and rubble "" .
It is now , the splash says , "" the deepest recession "" : "" Britain will be hit harder than any other advanced nation in the worst recession for more than 60 years , world economists warned last night .
"" The International Monetary Fund has forecast that the economy would shrink by 2.8 % this year , twice as much as previously thought .
In an inside piece , David Wighton writes : "" It 's official .
Britain will be the sick man of Europe this year .
Indeed , it will be the sick man of the world …
what is most shocking for many people about this downturn is how quickly Britain has gone from boom to bust .
So recently the government was boasting that the country had put its disappointing economic record behind it and had become one of the healthiest economies in the world .
Now it seems that Britain is again bringing up the rear , raising memories of the miseries of the 1970s . ""
Perhaps the last word then to Anne Ashworth who offers the following attempt at optimism in the Times : "" The latest pronouncements of impending doom are sufficient to dampen the spirits of even the most inveterate Pollyanna
…
But if we are to withstand the further blows that the recession will certainly deal us , we need to make the intellectual effort not to concentrate entirely on the dark side .
Remember the dangers of self - fulfilling prophecies .

A piece of pop culture acrimony harking back to the 1980s has emerged following reports that the director of the music video for Michael Jackson 's Thriller ( one of the most popular of all time ) is suing Jackson for failing to hand over his share of the profits .
The suit accuses Jackson of ' ' fraudulent , malicious and oppressive conduct '' , for failing to pay director John Landis 50 % of the profits .
It reads : "" After a spectacular theatrical premiere , the Thriller video became a worldwide megahit and an iconic pop culture phenomenon that has continued to generate profits for defendants Optimum Prods and Michael Jackson who have wrongfully refused to pay or account for such profits to the plaintiff .

The Guardian reports it is thought that Jackson may owe Landis $ 1 m ( £ 700,000 ) .

2009-01-29,"One of Iran 's most powerful clerics ­issued a stern warning against rapprochement with the US today and denounced supporters of the idea as "" troublemakers "" who belonged to "" hated groups "" .
In a graphic display of hardline resistance to the restoration of US - Iran ties , Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati – chairman of the influential guardian 's council and a vocal supporter of Iran 's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad – accused proponents of failing to appreciate the 1979 Islamic revolution and of harbouring westernising tendencies .
He also said the US feared Iran more than any other nation . ""
The US does not have any stake in our country , "" Jannati , who is renowned for anti - western tirades , told Iranian journalists .
"" I am warning some of society 's most abandoned and hated groups who are intending to establish relations with the US , want to meet with Obama and give the US president a green light : do not go in this direction .
You are just troublemakers .
Do not damage yourselves more .
Do not rely on America and do not hurt people . ""
His comments came after the Guardian revealed that President Barack Obama was considering sending a conciliatory letter to Iran 's leadership aimed at improving ­relations between Washington and Tehran and clearing the way for direct talks .
Some Iranian analysts believe the move could contribute towards allaying Tehran 's mistrust of Washington – especially if accompanied by a US pledge not to seek regime change and a promise to lift economic sanctions .
But Jannati 's outburst illustrates the bitter divisions a US attempt at conciliation would sow within Iran 's theocratic ruling system .
It also bears out warnings from some that an American gesture is unlikely to result in an immediate transformation in relations .
Analysts say the strength of radical opposition to renewed ties makes a prompt positive response from Tehran unlikely .
Nevertheless , Amir Mohebian , political editor of the pro - fundamentalist Resalat newspaper , said a letter which ruled out a US attempt at regime change in Iran would be seen as "" a good signal "" .
But he added : "" It would not be enough .
It would need actions , especially the removal of sanctions as well as a change in the US language towards Iran from the militaristic to the diplomatic . ""
He said the US should address any letter to Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – despite his known scepticism about restoring ties – rather than to ­Ahmadinejad .
He also played down the need for an American apology for alleged past misdeeds , despite Ahmadinejad 's demand for one yesterday . ""
The letter should say that they [ the US ] understand the realities , "" Mohebian said .
"" It 's not an apology .
The US is a country and so is Iran .
What is needed is mutual respect . """
2009-01-29,"Officials of Barack Obama 's administration have drafted a letter to Iran from the president aimed at unfreezing US - Iranian relations and opening the way for face - to - face talks , the Guardian has learned .

He called on Washington to apologise for its actions against Iran over the past 60 years , including US support for a 1953 coup that ousted the democratically elected government , and the US shooting down of an Iranian passenger plane in 1988 .
The state department refused to comment yesterday on the draft letters .
US concern about Iran mainly centres on its uranium enrichment programme , which Washington claims is intended to provide the country with a nuclear weapons capability .
Iran claims the programme is for civilian purposes .
The diplomatic moves are given increased urgency by fears that Israel might take unilateral action to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities .
The scale of the problem facing the new American president was reinforced yesterday when a senior aide to Ahmadinejad , Aliakbar Javanfekr , said that , despite the calls from the US , Iran had no intention of stopping its nuclear activities .
When asked about a UN resolution calling for the suspension of Iran 's uranium enrichment , Javanfekr , the presidential adviser for press affairs , replied : "" We are past that stage . ""
One of the chief Iranian concerns revolves around suspicion that the US is engaged in covert action aimed at regime change , including support for separatist groups in areas such as Kurdistan , Sistan - Baluchestan and Khuzestan .
The state department has repeatedly denied that there is any American support for such groups .
In its dying days , the Bush administration was planning to open a US interests section in the Iranian capital Tehran , one step down from an embassy .
Bush 's secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , said that never happened because attention was diverted by the Russian invasion of Georgia .
Others say that rightwingers in the Bush administration mounted a rearguard action to block it .
The idea has resurfaced , but if there are direct talks with Iran , it may be decided that a diplomatic presence would obviate the need for a diplomatic mission there , at least in the short term .
While Obama is taking the lead on policy towards Iran , the administration will soon announce that Dennis Ross will become a special envoy to the country , following the appointments last week of George Mitchell , the veteran US mediator , as special envoy to the Middle East , and Richard Holbrooke , who helped to broker the Bosnia peace agreement , as special envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Ross , who took a leading role in the Middle East peace talks in Bill Clinton 's administration , will be responsible on a day - to - day basis for implementing policy towards Iran .
In a graphic sign of Iranian mistrust , the hardline newspaper Kayhan , which is considered close to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has denounced Ross as a "" Zionist lobbyist "" .
Saeed Leylaz , a Tehran - based analyst , said a US letter would have to be accompanied by security guarantees and an agreement to drop economic sanctions .
"" If they send such a letter it will be a very significant step towards better ties , but they should be careful in not thinking Tehran will respond immediately , "" he said .
"" There will be disputes inside the system about such a letter .
There are lot of radicals who do n't want to see ordinary relations between Tehran and Washington .
To convince Iran , they should send a very clear message that they are not going to try to destroy the regime . """
2009-02-05,"Mohammed Khatami , the reformist Iranian leader , is close to declaring his candidacy for June 's presidential election against Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , raising hopes for a dramatic contest that could help to ease the country 's international isolation .
Khatami has told supporters that he will "" fulfil his promises "" and announce his readiness to run , despite personal reluctance , it was reported yesterday .
Relatives , allies and friends say a formal announcement will be made within days .
Speculation has been rife for months about whether the former president will challenge the controversial incumbent .
If he does , it will dramatise the choice for Iranian voters - between renewed reform and a grim political and economic status quo that is likely to mean tougher international sanctions over the nuclear issue .
"" I should fulfil my promises made to [ Iran 's ] people and announce my readiness [ to run ] , despite my personal wish , "" Khatami was quoted as telling youth groups .
"" Sometimes a human being has to make decisions that are against his will . ""
Khatami served two terms as president , from 1997 to 2005 , when he advocated dialogue with the west and did much to break down barriers of mistrust .
But reform efforts were dealt a blow when Ahmadinejad became president in 2005 .
The complex domestic political scene in Iran , which this week marked the 30th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution , is dominated by the highly conservative supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has the last say on most key issues , and by strains between clerics and the powerful revolutionary guards .
Jockeying before the election is attracting intense interest because of the call by President Barack Obama for a new US approach to Iran .
The two countries have had no relations since 1979 .
The impasse over Iran 's nuclear ambitions and its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza stand in the way of a thaw , as does the residue of hostility dating back to the 1950s .
The new US administration is grappling with the question of whether it should seek better relations before June and risk handing Ahmadinejad a prize that could boost his chances of winning .
Ahmadinejad has demanded that Washington apologise for decades of "" crimes "" .
But at home he has been attacked by many for mismanaging the economy and by some for his confrontational stances on foreign affairs ."
2009-02-05,"The British Council has stopped work in Iran because of "" intimidation and harassment "" of its staff by the Iranian government , it will be announced today .
The cultural and educational centre decided to close its doors in Tehran after its entire local staff of 16 was summoned by security officials to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's office at the end of December and ordered to resign . ""
An order of that kind in present circumstances in Iran is not something you can refuse ...
If not explicit , there was an implicit ' or else ' , "" the British Council 's chief executive , Martin Davidson , told the Guardian .
"" Once the security apparatus begins to display threatening behaviour to local members of staff who have no real protection , then that is unacceptable .
"" The announcement comes amid tensions over Iran 's nuclear programme and signals that the Ahmadinejad government may reject planned diplomatic overtures from Barack Obama 's new administration .
The US state department said yesterday that an American badminton team due to take part in an Iranian tournament had been denied visas at the last moment .
The British Council 's withdrawal from Iran marks the lowest point in Iranian - UK relations since Iran seized 15 British sailors and marines two years ago .
Even during that crisis the Tehran office continued to operate , providing a library , English language learning centre , and guidance for Iranians applying to study in Britain .
Today 's announcement has echoes of the closure of offices in two Russian cities a year ago , under similar pressure .
But the British Council has continued its work in Moscow despite the cooling of relations .
There are also British Council centres in Zimbabwe and Burma .
Iran is the only country in which the council has been stopped from working altogether .
"" This is really the culmination of two years of pressure from the authorities on our operations .
They first refused to issue visas for our UK director to go in .
They then began to put pressure on our Iranian partners to slow down or cancel work with us , "" Davidson said .
Shortly before the staff were ordered to resign , passports were confiscated from two employees as they attempted to leave the country to attend what the British Council described as a "" routine meeting "" .
Davidson said he was hoping for an opportunity to talk to the Iranian government about resuming work there .
An Iranian embassy spokesman in London said yesterday that he had been unable to get a response from Tehran to questions about the British Council 's closure .
The British Council was invited to open an office in 2001 and has organised joint educational events and exhibitions on the arts and climate change .
There are 2,000 Iranian students in Britain and at the time of the closure of its Tehran office , the British Council was working with the state education system , organising a course for 40 teacher trainers .
It was about to launch a co - operation scheme involving universities in both countries .
Noting that Iran was operating cultural centres in Britain , Davidson said : "" Cultural exchange should be a two - way street , not just one - way . ""
Distrust of Britain in Iranian official circles goes back to colonial days .
State - sponsored media often accuse British intelligence of being behind acts of sabotage and attacks by rebels in its provinces , and Britain is blamed for rallying UN security council support for sanctions resolutions aimed at Iran 's nuclear programme .
Senior international diplomats met in Wiesbaden , Germany , yesterday to co - ordinate positions on Iran for the first time since Obama took office .
The officials from the US , Britain , France , Germany , Russia and China talked about incentives offered to Iran in return for suspending enrichment of uranium and the possibility of further sanctions if Tehran refused to stop .
The US delegate , William Burns , said the new administration would need until mid - March to review Iran policy , but called on the group to agree on tough action if Tehran continued to rebuff US offers of a dialogue .
There was general agreement that the coming months could offer the last chance to reach a diplomatic solution before Iran 's nuclear programme gave it the basic ingredients for a bomb , possibly triggering Israeli military action ."
2009-02-09,"Muhammad Khatami , Iran 's leading reformist , has said he will stand against the hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in this summer 's elections , opening up the prospect of significant change that could bring improved relations with the US .
Khatami , 65 , ended months of speculation when he told supporters in Tehran yesterday : "" I strongly announce my candidacy in the elections .
Is it possible to remain indifferent toward the revolution 's fate and shy away from running ? ""
Analysts said the decision would mean a dramatic contest in June , offering voters a candidate who promoted liberalisation at home and accommodation with the west when he served as president for two terms from 1997 - 2005 during the so - called "" Tehran spring "" .
Ahmadinejad , the incumbent , is blamed for economic mismanagement and for isolating Iran by backing militant groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah and by his strident attacks on Israel .
In an optimistic scenario , if Khatami became president again he could be the leader who , in the words of Barack Obama , would "" unclench the fist "" and improve Iran 's strained relations with the US and the west .
That would clearly have to include agreement to defuse the row over the country 's nuclear ambitions .
Iran says it wants to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes but it is suspected of seeking to build nuclear weapons .
"" The differences between Khatami and Ahmadinejad are bigger than between Obama and McCain , "" said Mustafa Tajzad , a former minister .
"" The results of the Iranian election will matter for the whole world . ""
Khatami has condemned his rival 's "" aggressive and blistering rhetoric "" , saying it "" plays into the hands of the enemy , harming the country and the system . ""
Analysts and diplomats are divided over his chances of beating Ahmadinejad , so far supported by the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who makes all key decisions .
Muhammad Atrianfar , a close ally , told the Guardian he believed Khatami could win .
"" We feel instinctively that people are reformists now , especially after such bad government by Ahmadinejad .
Poor people who used to support him have turned against him . ""
Unofficial polling shows Khatami would beat the incumbent by a two - to - one margin , but an unusually big turnout - in the face of widespread voter apathy - would be needed to ensure victory .
Some fear Khatami may have harmed his chances by hesitating for so long over whether to throw his hat into the ring , reinforcing his image as a has - been ."
2009-02-10,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , opened the door today to the prospect of talks with the US , less than 24 hours after Barack Obama said face - to - face discussions could take place within months . ""
The new US administration has announced that they want to produce change and pursue the course of dialogue .
It is quite clear that real change must be fundamental and not tactical .
It is clear the Iranian nation welcomes real changes , "" Ahmadinejad told a rally in Tehran 's Freedom Square during celebrations marking the 30th anniversary of the Iranian revolution . ""
The Iranian nation is ready to hold talks , but talks in a fair atmosphere with mutual respect . ""
He said terrorism , the elimination of nuclear weapons , restructuring the UN security council and the fight against drug trafficking could be the subjects of discussion .
The Iranian leader said the world was "" entering an era of dialogue and intellect "" because military power had been unsuccessful , and "" does not want to see the dark age of Bush repeated "" .
His comments echoed those of Obama last night at his first press conference since taking office .
The US president said there was a possibility of a relationship of "" mutual respect and progress "" .
"" My expectation is , in the coming months , we will be looking for openings that can be created where we can start sitting across the table face - to - face with diplomatic overtures that will allow us to move our policy in the new direction , "" Obama said .
The US and Iran severed relations after the 1979 revolution and the west has been engaged in a stand - off with Tehran over its nuclear programme , which the US claims is an attempt to develop a nuclear weapons capability .
Iran insists the technology is being developed for peaceful purposes .
Obama said before winning the Democratic nomination for president that he would seek talks with Ahmadinejad , and since taking office he has made good on his promise by making overtures to Iran .
However , he warned last night that rapprochement would not happen overnight .
"" It 's important that , even as we engage in this direct diplomacy , we are very clear about certain deep concerns that we have as a country , that Iran understands that we find the funding of terrorist organisations unacceptable , that we 're clear about the fact that a nuclear Iran could set off a nuclear arms race in the region that would be profoundly destabilising , "" Obama said .
Despite sending a congratulatory message to Obama after he was elected , Ahmadinejad initially appeared to spurn his overtures by demanding an apology for "" crimes "" committed by the US against Iran .
Tehran raised fears over its missile capabilities last week when it claimed it had broken into the global space race after launching the country 's first domestically produced satellite into orbit .
Today 's comments will raise hopes that the change in US tactics has prompted a similar change of policy in Iran ."
2009-02-10,"A diplomatic minuet between the US and Iran is taking place that might just lead to better ties between two countries that have had no formal relations for 30 years .
In the latest development , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad – who usually spouts bloodcurdling rhetoric – sounded positively emollient towards the US .
In a speech to mark the 30th anniversary of the Iranian revolution , the president said the world was entering a "" new era of dialogue "" and that his country would welcome talks based on mutual respect with the US .
That was a marked change in tone compared with a speech Ahmadinejad made just a few weeks ago , in which he took a more uncompromising line .
Then , in a live televised address , Ahmadinejad said he would welcome a change in American policy provided it came with a withdrawal of US troops from Iraq and an apology for "" crimes "" America had committed against Iran , including US backing for the 1953 coup that overthrew the democratically elected Muhammad Mossadeq and restored the shah .
Or , as Julian Borger , the Guardian 's diplomatic editor , put it : ""
Yes , we can talk , he is saying , if you come on your hands and knees . ""
The overtures from the US began as soon as Barack Obama was elected in November , when the new administration said on the White House website that it was prepared to deal directly with Iran .
This was a major break from the Bush administration , which considered Iran part of an "" axis of evil "" along with Iraq – before the 2003 US - led invasion – and North Korea .
Obama has kept up his overtures : last night , the US president said he expected that his administration would be looking for "" openings "" where Washington and Tehran could sit down face to face .
The Guardian has reported on a letter the US has been working on to send to the Iranians .
But , as Martin Woollacott , who covered the Iranian revolution for the Guardian 30 years ago , warns , a rapprochement is not going to be simple : Both sides want concessions without budging from their main positions .
And , if they are to make any real progress , they first need to reconcile their conflicting understanding of the past , and , second , arrive at some agreement about what the Middle East should look like in the future .
Encouragingly , fresh thinking seems to be coming out of Washington at a time when Obama appears keen to lance the boil in US - Iranian relations .
Writing in Foreign Affairs , two Washington heavyweights , Richard Haass and Martin Indyk , argue that the US should abandon its demand that Iran suspend its uranium enrichment programme as a precondition for formal negotiations .
That demand by the Bush administration effectively blocked any chance for full diplomatic engagement .
Haas and Indyk go further in making the case that the US should be willing to discuss Iran 's right to enrich uranium , "" provided that Iran agrees to limit its enrichment programme under enhanced safeguards to keep it from developing a ' breakout capability ' – the capacity to produce significant amounts of weapons - grade uranium .
However , this right must be earned by Iran , not conceded by the United States . ""
As the US and Iran play diplomatic footsie with each other , Philippe Welti , a Swiss diplomat who spent more than four years as his country 's chief envoy to Iran , has this advice for the US : put American diplomats in Tehran .
"" They do n't lose anything , and they get a firsthand insight into the regime , "" he told the Los Angeles Times .
But Welti , who tells of his frustrations in dealing with Iran – including venal politicians – predicts it will be hard going in building up a relationship .
They were attacked in 1980 .
They were traumatised and still feel traumatised .
They are still living that war .
They have been exposed to a million threats for years now .
They 're simply getting ready .
It is very difficult for everybody to know what the ultimate purpose of the nuclear programme is .
Some observers think they are just buying time .
I am not in a position to judge ."
2009-02-11,"Iran gave a strong signal yesterday that it is prepared to start a mould - breaking dialogue with the United States in response to the dramatic call by Barack Obama for the Islamic Republic to "" unclench its fist "" .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's hardline president , used the final rally of celebrations of the 30th anniversary of the 1979 revolution to declare a readiness for talks with the US "" based on mutual respect and in a fair atmosphere "" .
Ahmadinejad told a crowd of hundreds of thousands in Tehran that change by Washington would have to be "" fundamental and not tactical "" - and attacked the former president George Bush , who included Iran in his notorious "" axis of evil "" .
But the Iranian leader reinforced the impression that the Obama administration 's emollient signals are being taken seriously - even if the prospects for change remain highly uncertain .
Overnight , Obama had predicted face - to - face discussions with Iran within months .
"" We will be looking for openings that can be created where we can start sitting across the table face - to - face with diplomatic overtures that will allow us to move our policy in the new direction , "" he said at his first press conference since taking office .
The timing and location of Ahmadinejad 's remarks could hardly have been more symbolic , marking the events - the overthrow of the US - backed shah and the establishment of the Islamic Republic - which opened up a chasm of hostility between the two countries .
The US and Iran severed relations after the revolution , which was followed by the holding of 52 American diplomats as hostages for 444 days and by US backing for Saddam Hussein 's Iraq during the eight - year war with Iran .
Underlining the continuing animosity , many in yesterday 's crowd in Tehran 's Azadi ( Freedom ) Square carried placards reading "" Death to America "" or burned US flags .
Other slogans included "" 30 years of freedom , 30 years of pride "" and "" Death to Israel . ""
"" The new US administration has announced that they want to produce change and pursue the course of dialogue , "" Ahmadinejad declared .
"" It is quite clear that real change must be fundamental and not tactical .
It is clear the Iranian nation welcomes real changes . ""
Celebrations of the revolution 's anniversary have been relatively lowkey , not least because approximately 70 % of the Iranian population was born after 1979 or has no memory of the shah 's rule .
Iranian state TV has been broadcasting archive footage of the revolution every day since 31 January , the anniversary according to the Persian calendar , of Ayatollah Khomeini 's return from exile .
But if disagreements persist over past relations between the US and Iran , dealing with present problems will be even more difficult , with the west locked in confrontation with Tehran over its nuclear programme , which the US claims is an attempt to develop nuclear weapons .
Iran insists it is for peaceful purposes .
The US administration must also take internal Iranian developments into account , especially since Sunday 's announcement by the reformist former president , Mohammad Khatami , that he will challenge Ahmadinejad in June 's presidential elections .
Reported attacks on Khatami by stick - wielding demonstrators yesterday were a reminder of how volatile that contest is likely to be ."
2009-02-17,"Iran 's most influential pro - regime newspaper has warned the country 's reformist former president , Mohammad Khatami , that he risks being assassinated like the late Pakistani political leader , Benazir Bhutto , if he stands in the forthcoming presidential election .
The warning from Keyhan ‑ a supporter of the radical president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ‑ is being seen as a thinly - veiled threat by hardliners that they will resort to violence to prevent Khatami winning June 's poll .
Khatami , who held the presidency between 1997 and 2005 , announced his candidacy last week , prompting expectations of a bitterly - fought contest with Ahmadinejad .
Analysts have predicted that a re - elected Khatami would ease many Islamic restrictions and would be more likely to respond positively to US attempts at engaging with Iran , as promised by Barack Obama .
But in an editorial by its editor - in - chief , Hossein Shariatmadari , the newspaper suggested that Khatami 's aim was to serve western interests by "" changing and remaking "" Iran 's theocratic system .
It compared him to Bhutto , whose 2007 assassination at an election rally , it implied , was ordered by the US . ""
These political groups aim at using the national and international reputation of this candidate to cast doubt on the entire method of elections .
The aim is to increase the cost to the regime , "" Keyhan wrote . ""
In Pakistan , the Americans initially tried very hard to bring Benazir Bhutto to power through propaganda and diplomacy , and to control Pakistan through her , but they adopted a different method when they realised that her party was completely incapable of winning majority seats .
This is an enlightening experience . ""
Khatami 's supporters have condemned the article as an attempt to intimidate him into withdrawing .
The pro - reformist association of combatant clerics called for the removal of Keyhan 's editors .
Shariatmadari – who answers directly to Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – retorted that Keyhan should be "" appreciated and thanked "" .
The paper 's anti - Khatami tone carries particular weight because its articles are often thought to reflect the views of Khamenei , who has given Ahmadinejad explicit backing .
Saeed Leylaz , a Tehran - based analyst , said the editorial reflected hardliners ' fear of Khatami and raised the possibility of violence .
"" This can be seen as a serious threat and shows that Mr Khatami is a big competitor to Mr Ahmadinejad , "" he said .
"" I worry that radicals will try to convince Mr Khatami not to participate by carrying out one or two terrorist attacks in the country .
It could be not just he who is under threat , but people close to him .
Radicals really ca n't bear to see anyone else other than Mr Ahmadinejad as president . """
2009-03-02,"It was meant to be Hollywood 's attempt at stealing a march on President Barack Obama 's offer to reach out a hand to Iran - an ambassadorial trip to a country where it is reviled as decadent and accused of depicting Iran as hostile and backward .
If the august group - including American Beauty star Annette Bening , and Field of Dreams director Phil Robinson - thought their arrival in Tehran would be greeted in a spirit of peace and harmony , they had underestimated the pent - up anger of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's staunchly anti - western government .
Ahmadinejad 's arts adviser , Javad Shamghadri , dashed hopes that the attempt at cultural detente would pass off smoothly when he demanded that the nine - strong delegation apologise for Hollywood 's perceived past sins if they wanted to meet leading figures in Iran 's film industry . ""
[ Iranian ] cinema officials will only have the right to have official sessions with ...
Hollywood movie - makers when they apologise to the Iranians for their 30 years of insults and slanders , "" Shamghadri told the news agency ISNA . ""
The Iranian people and our revolution have been repeatedly unjustly attacked by Hollywood .
We will believe Obama 's policy of change when we see change in Hollywood too , and if Hollywood wants to correct its behaviour towards Iranian people and Islamic culture then they have to officially apologise . ""
The demand for an apology echoed similar comments from Ahmadinejad , who has said Washington should admit past misdeeds as a condition for direct talks between the US and Iran .
It came as the group - which also included Sid Ganis , president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , William Horberg , producer of The Kite Runner , and Alfre Woodard , who acted in Desperate Housewives - began a charm offensive billed as a "" creative exchange "" but clearly aimed at bridging a gulf of mutual misunderstanding .
The delegation was invited to Iran by Khane Cinema ( Cinema House ) , the country 's biggest film group , which is under the authority of the ministry of culture and Islamic guidance .
It is scheduled to hold training workshops on acting , directing , documentary - making and other aspects of the business as well as tour the facilities of the state broadcaster , IRIB .
Meetings have been promised with Majid Majidi and Ebrahim Hatamikia , two local directors in good standing with the theocratic government .
The visit bucks a recent trend of Iran discouraging cultural and academic exchanges with the US on the grounds that they could be used to foment a "" velvet revolution "" against the Islamic regime .
An American women 's badminton team was denied entry last month despite having been invited to play in a tournament .
That the Hollywood celebrities were granted visas suggests the government wants to alter the way it is depicted and undermines claims by the academy 's communication director , Leslie Unger , that the visit had "" no political agenda "" .
"" The presence of the delegation might be an opportunity for showing the real image of Iran against the recent stream of anti - Iranian movies produced in Hollywood in which they try to show a bellicose , militaristic image of the country , "" wrote the newspaper Etemaad .
""
These well - known cinema figures can take a new genuine dynamic image of contemporary Iran . ""
Officials claim the country has suffered deliberate and systematic misrepresentation by Hollywood , which they often accuse of being controlled by pro - Zionist interests .
Two years ago , Ahmadinejad 's government condemned 300 , a Warner Bros production about the battle between Greeks and Persians at Thermopylae in 480BC , as "" psychological warfare "" and complained to the UN that it subjected Iranians to racial stereotyping .
More recently , it singled out The Wrestler , starring Mickey Rourke , which , among other things , included a wrestler called "" the Ayatollah "" .
Mistrust of Hollywood also prompted Ahmadinejad to decline a request by Oliver Stone , the director of JFK , to film a documentary about him .
Ahmadinejad 's advisers described Stone as "" part of the Great Satan "" , despite his renowned leftwing sympathies and a track record of making documentaries about Fidel Castro and Yasser Arafat .
The hostile official view clashes with that of many ordinary Iranians , who eagerly watch Hollywood productions on pirated DVDs and on ostensibly illegal satellite channels .
Hollywood films are also shown on state television but are censored for scenes deemed offensive to Islamic mores .
Offenders International films that angered Iran The Wrestler Caused offence when its main character , Mickey Rourke , smashed a pole carrying Iran 's national flag across his knee .

2009-03-06,"When the Iraqi journalist , Muntazar al - Zaidi , hurled his shoes at the then - US president , George Bush , in December , Iranian officials declared him a hero and hailed his gesture as a mark of Islamic courage .
They were presumably less impressed this week when Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , was similarly targeted during a visit to the north - western city of Urumiye .
Ahmadinejad found the shoe on the other foot as he waved to the crowd from an open - top car on his way to give a speech at a local stadium .
An Iranian website , Urumiye News , reported that a shoe was hurled at the president as his convoy drove through a central square .
Security guards waded into the crowds but failed to find the culprit .
A hat was also thrown in Ahmadinejad 's direction before his car sped away .
The event went unreported on mainstream Iranian news outlets but has been hotly discussed on the country 's highly active blogosphere .
Some pro - Ahmadinejad bloggers have dismissed the reports as rumours spread by "" royalists "" and "" counter - revolutionaries "" .
However , Ahmadinejad has been on the receiving end of flying footwear before .
A shoe was thrown at him during a students ' demonstration at Tehran 's Amir Kabir university in December 2006 .
Urumiye News said the latest protest came when a disturbance broke out after a vehicle in the presidential convoy struck an elderly man who walked onto the road to try and hand Ahmadinejad a letter .
People became angry when the driver failed to stop to attend to the injured man .
Eventually an ambulance in the motorcade was forced to take him to hospital after jeering crowds blocked its path .
Ahmadinejad travels frequently to Iran 's provinces in a bid to boost his popularity .
He commonly receives large numbers of letters requesting financial assistance and other help during such trips .
After Zaidi 's protest in Baghdad , Iranian officials paid tribute by holding several public shoe - throwing competitions in which contestants threw footwear at ­caricatures of Bush .
Iran 's main shoemaking federation also offered to supply a lifetime of shoes to Zaidi , who remains in a Baghdad jail awaiting trial ."

2009-03-11,"Live television is hardly the most convenient setting in which to be reminded of the age - old proverb that only children and fools speak the truth .
So the father who nicknamed his child 's toy monkey after Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , must have been mortified to have his private joke cruelly exposed when the youngster took part in one of the country 's most popular TV phone - ins .
The embarrassing disclosure was made on Amoo Pourang ( Uncle Pourang ) , a programme watched by millions of Iranian children three times a week on state TV .
It came when the unsuspecting presenter , Dariush Farziayi , asked the name of the toy animal his young caller had been given as a reward for good behaviour . ""
Well , my father calls him Ahmadinejad , "" the child replied .
Now the father 's discomfort has spread to the programme - makers after the state broadcaster , IRIB , responded by withdrawing it from viewing schedules .
The final episode will be screened next week after a successful seven - year run .
A conservative website , Jahan News , quoting "" reliable sources , "" said the decision was prompted by the "" high financial and spiritual damage "" inflicted by live broadcasts .
Stopping short of identifying the president by name , it highlighted an incident in which "" a child in a live telephone line compared its doll to one of the well - known authorities and managers "" .
The incident is believed to have been the last straw following several other naive indiscretions by callers , which caused acute embarrassment and offended Iran 's religious conservative mores .
In one instance , Farziayi was left open mouthed and groping for an appropriate response when , after asking a participant to hand the phone to his mother or father , he was told : "" They are in the shower . ""
On another occasion , asking which of two twins was kissed first by their father on his return home from work , he was answered : "" My daddy always kisses mummy first .
"" It is not the first Iranian broadcast to become a victim of the pitfalls of live transmissions .
In the 1980s , the spiritual leader of the Islamic revolution , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , pronounced death sentences for the makers of a radio programme in which a female respondent named a Japanese soap opera character as her role model , rather than Fatimah , the Prophet Muhammad 's daughter .

Khatami , who held the presidency for two terms between 1997 and 2005 , is understood to have told associates that he was standing down in favour of another reformist , Mir Hossein Mousavi , who announced he was running last week .
He believes the move is necessary to unite the pro - reformist vote in what is expected to be a fierce struggle to unseat the current president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in June 's poll .
Khatami is said to have informed friends of his intention on Sunday night after meeting with Mousavi , who was Iran 's prime minister during the 1980s .
Before announcing last month that he was a "" serious "" candidate , Khatami had said that either he or Mousavi would stand for the reformists in the election .
His apparent withdrawal , revealed in a series of leaks , was greeted with dismay by Khatami supporters who were engaged yesterday in frantic efforts to persuade him to reconsider .
One group set up a mobile phone campaign called Stay Khatami which urged backers to send text message to the former president to make their feelings known .
Liberal clerics also contacted him to voice their disagreement .
The backlash appeared to shock him into at least delaying a final decision .
An expected announcement was put back until after a scheduled meeting last night with the Association of Combatant Clerics , a group of moderate religious figures .
Khatami 's most committed backers believe he would stand a better chance of ousting Ahmadinejad than either Mousavi or another reformist contender , Mehdi Karoubi , a former parliament speaker .
But Khatami reportedly believes Mousavi would be the stronger candidate . ""
Many of my youth supporters are not prepared to support Mousavi but he is more appropriate because he has the votes of some fundamentalists and this is a big asset , "" Teribon , a reformist website , quoted him as saying .
Mousavi , 68 , helped steer Iran through the 1980 - 88 war with Iraq and is remembered for strongly favouring state - intervention in the economy . ""
Mousavi 's social base is similar to Ahmadinejad 's and because of this I predict that he would be a more dangerous opponent for him than Khatami , "" said Saeed Leylaz , a Tehran - based analyst .
"" If there is a fair and free election , he will be a winner .
Even if Khatami stays in the race , the continuing saga could damage him by reminding voters of his reputation for indecision .
He only decided to stand in the first place after months of mixed signals .
In the run - up to last year 's parliamentary elections , he was touted to spearhead the reformists ' attempted comeback only to eventually decline to run ."
2009-03-20,"In his Nowruz message to Iran , President Barack Obama is using the most effective diplomatic tool at his disposal - his new face .
The line put out by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the rightwing Iranian press is that Obama is just a continuation of Bush by other means – American imperialist business as usual .
But by sending out a video on satellite television and online , with a direct spoken message , Obama undermines that claim and drains some of the fuel from Ahmadinejad 's anger - driven political machine .
The dilemma that faced Obama and his advisers was how to extend a hand to Iran without giving a lift to Ahmadinejad 's campaign for re - election in June .
They did not want him to be able to claim that his hostile stance to the west had made the US and its allies softer and more compliant .
They needed to show that the Iranian president 's policies and personality were exacting a cost to Iran , but that it was an unnecessary cost .
The reference to "" threats "" is instrumental .
Obama is drawing attention to the boorish side of Ahmadinejad , the menacing tone towards Israel and questioning of the Holocaust , which makes many of his fellow Iranians cringe .
It serves also as a sly means for Obama to disown his predecessor 's style .
The 600-word address is perhaps most noticeable for the words left out .
For once there is no mention of Iran 's nuclear programme – something most Iranians support in principle but which is the focus of the standoff with the west .
To have rehearsed those arguments would have signalled business as usual , the same old impasse , and detracted from the "" new beginning "" theme .
Make no mistake , all of that is still on the table , but Obama is reasoning that on first introductions , it pays to stick to what you have in common ."
2009-03-20,"Iran today hailed an unprecedented direct appeal by the US president , Barack Obama , for better relations between the two countries , but urged the US to "" realise its previous mistakes "" as well as end sanctions and drop its support for Israel .
Ali - Akbar Javanfekr , an aide to the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , welcomed the approach from Washington on the occasion of Nowruz , the Iranian new year .
However , there was no official response from Tehran to a far blunter message from Shimon Peres , the president of Israel , who called on Iran to "" return to the enlightened world "" and halt the uranium enrichment that could allow it manufacture nuclear weapons .
"" The Iranian nation has shown that it can forget hasty behaviour , "" said Javanfekr in a reference to Obama 's message , "" but we are awaiting practical steps by the United States . ""
The new US administration needed a "" fundamental change in attitude "" , he said .
But Iran would "" not show its back "" to Obama if the US put its words into practice . ""
By fundamentally changing its behaviour , America can offer us a friendly hand .
So far what we have received have been unfriendly fists .
Unlimited sanctions which have been renewed by the United States are wrong and need to be reviewed , "" he said .
Javanfekr also singled out US backing for Israel , currently the only nuclear power in the Middle East .
"" Supporting Israel is not a friendly gesture and the New Year is an opportunity for the United States to change this policy , "" he said .
The swift but conditional response from Tehran underlined how wide the wide gap is between the two countries even as Obama 's carefully crafted message offered a "" new beginning "" after 30 years of animosity .
It was the latest chapter in a presidential charm offensive that has so far been conducted at arms length and which has barely touched on several key disputes .
In the three and a half minute video , shown on a number of TV networks in the Middle East , Obama said he wanted to "" speak directly to the people and leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran "" to make clear his desire to establish "" constructive ties "" .
"" My administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , "" the president said .
Strikingly , though , he mentioned none of them directly : not Iran 's nuclear programme , its support for Hezbollah and Hamas , or its profound hostility to Israel .
The timing and format of the broadcast , shown with Persian subtitles , emphasised its broad appeal - to an entire country at a time of traditional celebration rather than solely to a government whose internal complexities compound the difficulty for US policymakers . ""
For nearly three decades relations between our nations have been strained , "" Obama reminded his audience . ""
But at this holiday we are reminded of the common humanity that binds us together .
"" The message was a reprise of the commitment to engagement approach he signalled in his inaugural address and was made in an emollient tone that contrasted sharply with that used by George Bush , who included the Islamic Republic in his "" axis of evil "" .
"" This process will not be advanced by threats , "" the president said .
"" We seek instead engagement that is honest and grounded in mutual respect . ""
Despite avoiding mention of the nuclear dossier - specifically Iran 's refusal to halt uranium enrichment - Obama did warn that "" terror and arms "" did not sit well with the "" real responsibilities "" that went with Iran 's "" rightful place in the community of nations "" .
Israel 's Nowruz message , broadcast on its Persian radio channel , was far less subtle . ""
Children ca n't be fed enriched uranium for breakfast , "" said Peres .
"" The leaders should let people live , let women breathe , let the economy grow , and stop spending their days dealing with bombs and uranium - is this in the name of God ?
Is this what Allah asked of them ? ""
Israel 's president also attacked Ahmadinejad for his denial of the Holocaust , saying : "" Since when is he an expert on the Jewish Holocaust ?
Was he in Auschwitz ?
What does he know ?
All he does is speak and speak all day long . ""
The White House and state department have been looking at a range of ways to reach out to Iran .
It has been invited to an international conference on Afghanistan later this month and the US wants to see it co - operate as US forces prepare to leave Iraq .
Another idea is for Obama to write an open letter to the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
US officials want to avoid doing anything that might boost the chances of Ahmadinejad , the populist hardliner who is standing for re - election in June .
Reopening a US interests section in Tehran – scene of the notorious hostage - taking drama at the old US embassy during the 1979 revolution - is reportedly another possibility .
But Iranian memories go back much further , to the 1953 CIA - backed coup that overthrew the nationalist prime minister Mossadegh , and decades of American support for the shah .
As Obama pointed out , with presidential understatement , it would not be easy to overcome "" the old divisions "" .
Neither Khamenei nor Ahmadinejad mentioned Obama 's appeal in their own Nowruz messages .
Khameni said in his speech that attempts to block Iran 's nuclear progress had reached a "" dead end . """
2009-03-29,"A row has broken out over allegations of antisemitism at the New York Times , America 's most vaunted name in journalism and a newspaper with a large Jewish readership .
The storm centres on a column about Jews in Iran written by New York Times journalist Roger Cohen and a cartoon attacking the recent war in Gaza .
The newspaper , and Cohen in particular , has been accused of being too critical of Israel and an apologist for Iran and its leader , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Cohen 's column was written from Iran about the country 's small Jewish minority .
His piece acknowledged the difficulties the group experienced and portrayed them as part of an Iranian society that he said was more tolerant , democratic and sophisticated than many American critics allowed .
Such sentiments might seem uncontroversial , but in America no one touching on issues around Israel or antisemitism escapes close scrutiny .
Cohen was attacked by Jewish writers and bloggers .
The Jerusalem Post dubbed him "" misled "" , while the Atlantic Monthly called him "" credulous "" .
Others went much further . ""
The Nazis had Theresienstadt , their ' model ' concentration camp used to ' persuade ' the gullible that Jews and others who aroused the ire of the Nazis were being treated well .
Would Roger Cohen have had no problem portraying that favourably as well ? "" fumed writer Ed Lasky on the American Thinker website .
Cohen said he was stunned by the vehemence of the response , an impression exacerbated when he visited exiled Iranian Jews in California and was abusively heckled .
"" I was surprised at the anger and intensity of the reaction ...
I expected a reaction but did not expect it to blow up into a whole furore , "" Cohen said .
Perhaps part of the reason for the intensity of the attack is the fact that he is Jewish himself .
"" I think it 's partly my name .
The ' self - hating Jew ' things can come to the surface in some of the responses , "" he said .
Another reason is that the column appeared in the Times , which many media experts hardly see as a fierce critic of Israel , given its home audience . "" As soon as I read the column I thought a lot of people would be unhappy , "" said Jack Lule , a journalism professor at Lehigh University .
The debate over Cohen 's piece came as the Times published Pat Oliphant 's cartoon , which shows a headless figure goose - stepping and pushing a snarling Star of David in front of it .
The figure is herding a woman carrying a child labelled Gaza to the edge of a cliff .
The cartoon also appeared in the Washington Post , Slate and other publications .
It caused instant outrage among Jewish groups .

2009-03-31,"Millions of pounds in government aid and an editorial brief to act as cheerleader for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad should have ensured Iran 's version of the Sun a bright future .
But the economic crisis sending a chill through newsrooms across the world has driven the downmarket daily to extinction six months after it was launched with the ambition of capturing a mass readership .
The closure of Khorshid [ Sun ] follows a brief stormy existence marked by management rows , mass journalist resignations , dropping sales and criticism of an £ 8.6 m budget provided by the social security organisation , the state pension body .
This week 's decision to cease publication was prompted by a call for austerity by Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who announced that cutting consumption should be the theme of the new Iranian year as the country struggled to cope with the recession .
The paper 's demise has been met with glee from Ahmadinejad 's critics , who saw it as a propaganda tool designed to whip up public support for his re - election campaign in June 's presidential poll .
Khorshid was launched in October by one of Ahmadinejad 's aides , Muhammad Paryab , who said it would concentrate on a populist mix of human interest , entertainment and sport while providing minimal political news .
He predicted an initial sale of 200,000 which would rise steadily .
Circulation was rumoured to have dropped to 60,000 after plans to expand editions from 24 to 36 full - colour pages were reversed in favour of scaling down to 16 pages ."
2009-04-07,"A year after becoming president in 2005 , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad declared that the 20th day in the Persian month of Farvardin would officially be known as National Nuclear Technology day .
On this day , which falls on Thursday 9 April this year , the government and people of Iran are to celebrate their country 's nuclear achievements .
Ahmadinejad is not in charge of Iran 's nuclear programme .
The supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , is .
Nevertheless , he allows Ahmadinejad to use the occasion to inform the people of Iran about the technical progress made by Iran 's nuclear programme during the past year .
Last year , Ahmadinejad declared that "" Iran was ready to install some 6,000 new centrifuges at the nuclear facility in the central province of Natanz "" .
This year , National Nuclear Technology day will have added importance for the president .
While Ahmadinejad will be making his yearly speech about Iran 's nuclear accomplishments , he will be well aware that from that day , only 64 days remain until the presidential elections , scheduled for 12 June .
The past year has been one of the worst for Ahmadinejad since he took office .
He has suffered a number of embarrassing domestic defeats .
One of them was parliament 's unwillingness to pass the subsidies reduction clause in this year 's budget , which called for the reduction of energy subsidies and to distribute the money instead to Iran 's poor as cash handouts .
Parliamentarians are worried this may further increase the level of inflation .
Ahmadinejad has invested heavily in this clause .
He has been promoting it since last year and parliament 's resistance has damaged his credibility .
The other setback was the embarrassing dismissal of Ali Kordan , his interior minister , by parliament .
Kordan was found to have had a forged doctorate degree from Oxford university .
This created a large number of email and text message jokes about the former minister 's credentials by offering degrees from "" Aksford "" and "" Oxphord "" university .
The fact that Ahmadinejad backed Kordan until the last moment caused further blows to his standing .
Even football and its extraordinary popularity in Iran do not seem to have helped the president .
During the last world cup qualifying match between Iran and Saudi Arabia in Tehran , Ahmadinejad made a surprise appearance in the stadium , 30 minutes after the start of the game .
However , the fact that Iran lost 2 - 1 on home soil after initially leading their Saudi rivals 1 - 0 led to the popular belief that Ahmadinejad had ' ghadame shoor ' , a Persian expression that describes someone who brings bad luck .
This was n't the first time Ahmadinejad made a surprise appearance at a major sporting event .
The previous occasion was in early March when Iran made it to the finals of the World Wrestling Championship against Azerbaijan .
Iran lost that match too .
In all likelihood , Ahmadinejad is going to make the most of this year 's nuclear technology day ceremony to boost his falling popularity at home .
Unlike the economy , the nuclear programme is one area which Ahmadinejad has not ruined .
Many people believe that the only reason is because he is not in charge of it .
Nevertheless , thanks to Ayatollah Khamenei , Ahmadinejad will gladly use the opportunity as a means to boost his position .
This will be the case even if Iran 's nuclear programme has not made any spectacular gains in the past year .
Ahmadinejad could quite possibly paint a picture that is rosier than the reality .
He will have no other choice —
this is his last chance before the elections .
The Iranian electorate is unforgiving and he has to take every opportunity to reach out to them .
The international community , especially Israel and the US , may have a different perception on Ahmadinejad 's nuclear technology day declarations .
Any major announcement could be taken as a sign of antagonism , or threat .
This would be logical .
However , the international community should understand that promoting one 's capability and leveraging power is a tried and tested negotiation method .
In other words , there is also the possibility that forthcoming statements could be mere bolstering to improve Iran 's position before the start of negotiations with the US .
This is one area which Ahmadinejad has no control over .
In fact , negotiations with the US may make or break his presidency .
Until now , the supreme leader has offered unprecedented support to Ahmadinejad .
However , new events on the ground may mean that for the next elections , matters may not be entirely in Khamenei 's hands .
The election of Barack Obama and his offer of unconditional talks with Iran have created new challenges for the supreme leader .
With such a popular president at the helm in Washington , shunning America could be a costly mistake .
Khamenei realises that during the expected negotiations , Obama would prefer a reformist resident of the presidential office in Louis Pasteur Street in Tehran .
This is why he is waiting to negotiate with Iran after the Iranian presidential elections .
He does not want to improve Ahmadinejad 's chances .
Although the supreme leader is under no obligation to compromise with Obama , shunning the US president would be damaging , both diplomatically and economically .
Realising that the re - election of Ahmadinejad may be interpreted as a rebuff in Washington , it is very possible that Khamenei may decide that Ahmadinejad 's removal may serve his interests far more than keeping him as president .
On nuclear technology day , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad could try to take all the glory for Iran 's nuclear programme .
Despite that , the day after Iran 's presidential elections , he may find himself the most prominent victim of the "" Obama factor "" ."
2009-04-08,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , is today expected to claim major progress in his country 's nuclear programme at a critical moment in US - Iranian relations .
The announcement , to mark Iran 's nuclear technology day , will come as fresh attempts are made to restart talks over Iran 's enrichment of uranium for the first time since Barack Obama took office .
Yesterday senior officials from the US , Britain , France , Germany , Russia and China instructed the EU foreign policy chief , Javier Solana , to make contact with his counterpart in Tehran .
The group also welcomed the Obama administration 's decision to fully engage in the talks .
Ahmadinejad said his country would welcome talks with Obama if the US president proved "" honest "" in extending a hand to Iran .
But dialogue will depend more on what the Iranian president announces today .
"" I will have good nuclear news for the honoured Iranian nation , "" Ahmadinejad said .
Reports suggest he will claim Iran has perfected techniques for the manufacture of uranium fuel .
But David Albright , a former UN weapons inspector , said if that was all Ahmadinejad claimed , there would be relief in the US administration , which fears Iran could begin to use new centrifuges at its Natanz uranium enrichment plant , bringing it closer to a bomb - making capability ."
2009-04-09,"Barack Obama 's decision to "" extend a hand "" to Iran has so far brought little in the way of unclenched fists .
True , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad did welcome an American offer to take part in direct nuclear talks – but on the same day it was announced that a US - born journalist with Iranian citizenship was facing espionage charges in Tehran .
Today 's ceremonial opening of a nuclear fuel plant near Isfahan was surely meant to signal that Iran insists on its right to uranium enrichment – exactly what the UN insists it halt .
Ahmadinejad said he was ready for negotiations based on "" justice and respect "" .
So far , so non - committal .
Yet the atmospherics have changed significantly under Obama : his Nowruz message to the Iranian people , comments by Hillary Clinton and Iran 's invitation to a recent conference on Afghanistan are all hard evidence of what the president called "" engagement that is honest and grounded in mutual respect . ""
The shift from the Bush era is staggering .
Obama 's approach met with palpable relief from the EU , Russia and China this week when they welcomed "" the new direction of US policy "" - a barely - coded reminder of the bad old days .
References to the "" Islamic Republic of Iran "" and "" mutual respect "" were intended , transparently , to flatter rather than cajole even if the reference to "" dual - track "" strategy was a reminder of sticks if the carrots on offer are not taken .
Interestingly , no one is now waiting to act until after Iran 's presidential elections in June , as some had advised , arguing that a new initiative now might bolster Ahmadinejad .
That has been knocked down .
This is clearly urgent .
Hints of secret high - level dialogue between personal representatives of Obama and of Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader – the man who really calls the shots in Tehran – suggest detailed messages may be being delivered in private .
If there was ever a moment for some old - fashioned secret diplomacy , this is it .
Beyond Obama 's charm offensive and technical calculations about the numbers of centrifuges spinning at the Natanz plant , it is unclear how matters are likely to progress .
Leaks from the US suggest discussion of the radical option of accepting that it is no longer realistic to demand zero enrichement .
In Prague last weekend Obama offered Tehran the choice between peaceful nuclear energy under international supervision or continuing isolation .
A multinational fuel consortium and full access for inspectors could be the sort of tricks that will work .
Strikingly , though , there was no mention of military action and Obama failed to use the signature Bush phrase about "" all options "" being on the table .
On the other side of the balance sheet the Russians are said to be more convinced than before that US intelligence has got it right this time – whatever everyone remembers about Saddam 's non - existent WMD .
Enrichment is the red line for the Israelis , who since Likud 's Bibi Netanyahu came to power have been banging the drum for action to rein in Tehran - and talking of the months not years that remain before it is it too late .
It was another sign of changing times that Joe Biden fired a public shot across Bibi 's bows , calling an Israeli attack on Iran "" ill - advised "" .
Inside Iran , public attitudes have not changed : some privately see enrichment as ( another ) anti - western provocation by Ahmadinejad .
Most , though , remember that the national nuclear effort began under the Shah and believe the programme is intended to generate electricity rather than build bombs .
Mir - Hossein Mousavi , the leading reformist candidate challenging Ahmadinejad in June , attacks the incumbent as an "" extremist "" – music to the ears of anyone who hopes for internal change .
But no one in Iran , he has insisted , would negotiate away the country 's right to peaceful nuclear energy .
If Obama 's new - style diplomacy pays off that will not be in question .
Still , it looks like a long , complex and nerve - wracking haul ahead ."
2009-04-09,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , today declared progress on two fronts in his country 's nuclear programme , both of which were said by western experts to bring Iran closer to a bomb .
Ahmadinejad , speaking in the central city of Isfahan , said Iranian scientists had mastered the fabrication of fuel pellets from natural uranium , and had tested two new types of centrifuge used to enrich uranium , "" with a capacity a few times higher than the existing centrifuges "" .
The pellets are intended for use at a heavy water reactor under construction at Arak , which Iran says is being built to make isotopes for medical use .
The centrifuges would accelerate the enrichment of uranium , which is officially intended for a nuclear power reactor that is yet to be built .
Western governments say the Arak reactor will be used for making plutonium , and that the centrifuges are ultimately intended for weapons - grade uranium .
Both plutonium and highly enriched uranium can be used to make a nuclear bomb .
The Iranian president 's announcement , made at the formal opening of a fuel fabrication plant in Isfahan to mark Iran 's official "" nuclear technology day "" , raises the stakes in future negotiations over Iran 's refusal to abide by UN security council resolutions demanding the suspension of uranium enrichment .
Yesterday senior officials from the US , Britain , France , Germany , Russia and China instructed the EU foreign policy chief , Javier Solana , to make contact with his counterpart in Tehran .
They urged Iran to take advantage of the Obama administration 's readiness to hold direct talks .
In his speech , Ahmadinejad said Iran had "" always been for talks "" , on condition that negotiations had "" to be based on justice and respecting rights "" .
The remarks echo a formula frequently used by the Iranian leadership that make progress in negotiations conditional on basic changes in US foreign policy .
Arrangements are now being discussed between Brussels and Tehran to set up a new round of face - to - face talks on proposals by the six - nation contact group to provide economic and technical aid to Iran if it suspends uranium .
However , there is little optimism of such talks having a better chance of success than the last abortive round in Geneva in July .
Karim Sadjadpour , an Iran analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , said that Ahmadinejad had been careful not to rule out talks ahead of presidential elections in June .
However , Sadjadpour added : "" Unlike in Washington , where a decision has been taken to pursue dialogue , an internal consensus has not been reached in Iran .
There is a powerful minority that believes any opening to the US could undermine the regime . ""
Since last July 's failed talks in Geneva , the Iranian nuclear programme has made significant strides .
The International Atomic Energy Agency reported in February that Iran had manufactured a tonne of low enriched uranium – enough , according to some estimates , to make a bomb if enriched further to weapons - grade purity .
If the advanced centrifuges mentioned by Ahmadinejad were perfected and put into operation in large numbers , it would significantly speed up the process of enrichment , and reduce the amount of time Iran would need to make a bomb .
The possible alternative route to a nuclear weapon , using plutonium , is a less immediate concern to the west .
The Arak reactor is not expected to become operational for at least three years , but IAEA inspectors are not being allowed access , and a dome has been built over the reactor so progress can no longer be assessed from satellite photographs .
It has become a growing worry for nuclear proliferation experts . ""
Arak is of a size and style that can produce high - quality plutonium that can be used for nuclear weapons , "" Leonard Spector , of the Monterey Institute of International Studies , said .
"" India used a reactor like this for its first nuclear weapon .
Every new development that brings this closer to fruition is something to be very concerned about . """
2009-04-10,"It 's a paradox but it 's true .
The more pressure the west puts on the Iranian government over its nuclear policy , the more popular President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad becomes .
Ahmadinejad began his nuclear campaign four years ago by choosing yesterday as Iran 's National Day of Nuclear Technology and he marked the occasion this year by adding the final step in enrichment technology , triumphally inaugurating Isfahan 's Fuel Manufacturing Plant ( FMP ) despite international sanctions and Obama 's recent expressions of concern .
For a populist president like Ahmadinejad , nothing is as helpful for his presidential re - election campaign as the international and domestic attention that this is generating .
Internally , it has rallied Iranians to support him by setting aside all other conflicts and discontent with the government of the Islamic Republic .
Ahmadinejad is subtly aware of Iranian history .
He remembers well how strongly Iranians supported Mohammad Mosaddeq 's struggle with Britain to nationalise the Iranian oil industry almost half a century ago .
Although Mossadeq is rarely mentioned officially as the father of Iran 's nationalised oil industry , he is still admired by the public – and Ahmadinejad would love to go into history as Iran 's nuclear Mosaddeq .
Ahmadinejad is harvesting what Khatami sowed , but he 's using it as a diversion from his radical policies and internal mismanagement in other areas .
Ahmadinejad welcomes any controversy over the nuclear issue as it 's the only means to promote Iranian zealotry at a critical moment as the June election approaches and the world 's economic crisis begins to be felt in Iran .
Ahmadinejad has also been the first president to hold cabinet meetings in the provinces and meet rural people .
Since taking office four years ago he has visited almost all Iranian provinces more than once , boasting of his government 's achievements in nuclear technology and its stand against the west .
The obsession of western countries and foreign media with Iran 's nuclear issue has also distracted attention from human rights abuses – the issue that could weaken Ahmadinejad and his government most of all .
Because of this the international community is also paying little attention to the women 's movement , bloggers ' prosecutions and restrictions on freedom of expression .
In Iran , a country where the state - run TV is the main source of information outside Tehran , people are also distracted by Ahmadinejad 's nuclear campaign .
Ahmadinejad has asserted "" our right to have nuclear technology "" in almost all his tortuous speeches to crowds waving placards that carry the same message .
Approaching the election , Ahmadinejad himself is not very interested in anything but the nuclear issue .
He has largely ignored Obama 's conciliatory message , referring to it only very briefly in his speech in Isfahan on Wednesday .
He does n't want anything spoiling his nuclear celebration .
He did n't refer to Obama at alll when hundreds of basijis shouting "" death to Obama "" gathered in front of the former US embassy in Tehran to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the rupture in Iran - US ties ."
2009-04-11,"President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad celebrated "" National nuclear day "" , as 9 April was dubbed by Iran 's rulers , with a visit to Isfahan , where he announced that Iran 's atomic scientists had mastered the manufacture of uranium fuel pellets for nuclear fuel .
This comes at a propitoius time for Iran 's relations with the rest of the world .
Barack Obama 's conciliatory approach to Iran during his inauguration speech in January was followed by a further olive branch proferred last month .
This followed so closely after Gordon Brown offered Iran an atomic bargain in his major speech on international nuclear co - operation at a conference organised by the foreign office in the middle of last month , some might think it was co - ordinated .
The deal : aid with nuclear energy development in exchange for good non - proliferation behaviour .
This atomic aid would go ahead notwithstanding the reality that Iran floats on a sea of oil and natural gas and has vast areas of desert in the south bathed in sunshine 365 days a year , making it blessed with massive solar energy potential .
But France , which shares Brown 's atomic ambition to spread nuclear power worldwide , got in first in nuclear collaboration with Iran .
The official Iranian Atomic Energy Organisation ( IAEO ) is a 40 % shareholder – with French state - owned nuclear conglomerate , Areva – in Sofidif , a uranium enrichment joint - venture company , the very technology that has made Iran such a pariah state in the global nuclear community .
The arrangement dates back to 23 February 1974 , and remains in place .
Sofidif still retains a 25 % share in Eurodif , the international uranium enrichment consortium that runs France 's huge plant in Pierrelatte in the south of France .
The IAEO drew a net income from dividends of some € 7 m in 2005 , according to a report , The Permanent Nth Country Experiment : Nuclear Weapons Proliferation in a Rapidly Changing World ( pdf ) , prepared by Paris - based researcher Mycle Schneider , for the Green Group in the European parliament in March 2007 .
France and the UK are both part of the so - called European Troika , along with Germany , negotiating with Iran over its nuclear programme .
So with olive branch offers from Obama and Brown , and Sarkozy 's national nuclear industry already in a corporate interlock with the Iranians with the very sensitive atomic technology that has raised so many diplomatic hackles , there now seems real opportunity for progress .
If only there could be a little less hypocrisy ."
2009-04-15,"President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran today claimed to have drawn up a package of proposals to end the stand - off with the US and Europe over Tehran 's alleged nuclear weapons ambitions .
The US , in response , said it would study any proposals and expressed hope that they would address the international community 's concerns .
The comments from both side reflect the growing chance of a rapprochment between the long - term enemies since Barack Obama began making overtures in January towards the state that had been branded part of the "" axis of evil "" by former president George Bush .
Iran and the US are expected to meet face to face soon for the first talks on the nuclear issue .
Ahmadinejad , in a speech in the south - eastern province of Kerman , broadcast on state - run television , said : "" We have prepared a package that can be the basis to resolve Iran 's nuclear problem .
It will be offered to the west soon .
This new package will ensure peace and justice for the world .
It respects rights of all nations .
"" US and European officials urged caution , as similar pronouncements by Iranian leaders in the last few years in the end amounted to little more than rhetoric .
But Ahmadinejad may be ready to go further this time because of domestic pressure .
Obama 's overtures have apparently gone down well with parts of the Iranian public , and he faces an election this summer .
The prospect of a deal has been increased by the willingness of Obama to drop Bush 's precondition for talks with Iran .
Negotiations could begin without it first suspending uranium enrichment .
Iran may be preparing a compromise in which it will continue with uranium enrichment , but allow the UN watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency , to make more intrusive and surprise inspections to ensure it is not building a nuclear weapon .
Another possible compromise , first put forward by Moscow , would be for Russia to supply Iran with enriched uranium , while retaining control over the enriched uranium .
Tehran claims its nuclear programme is only for civilian purposes - to produce electricity .
Iran and the US may eventually have to settle for a fudge that would see Tehran mastering the technology needed to make a nuclear weapon but not making it .
The Obama administration might reluctantly accept that , but the Israeli government , which is threatening an air strike against Iran 's nuclear plants , may not .
A US state department spokesman , Robert Wood , responding to Ahmadinejad 's promise of new proposals , said : "" If they come up with some new package with regard to their nuclear programme , we 'll take a look and see what it is .
Our hope will be that it addresses all of the concerns that the US and other countries have . ""
An Iranian official told Reuters today that suspension of uranium enrichment was out of the question , but Iran might agree to increased IAEA scrutiny ."
2009-04-15,"Tehran is preparing new proposals to break the deadlock over its nuclear programme , the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , said today in a sign of thawing relations with the west .
Avoiding his usual fiery rhetoric , Ahmadinejad said : "" Today we are preparing a new package .
Once it becomes ready , we will present that package .
It is a package that constitutes peace and justice throughout the globe and also respects other nations ' rights . ""
In an apparent reference to recent overtures from President Barack Obama , and a signal from Washington and Europe that they are prepared to make significant concessions to get Iran to restart nuclear negotiations , Ahmadinejad told a crowd of thousands in Kerman , south - eastern Iran , that circumstances had changed .
But the Iranian leader could not resist boasting that Iran 's resistance and progress in nuclear technology had forced Washington to back down .
"" You know well that today you are suffering from weaknesses .
You have no choice .
You ca n't make any progress through bullying policies , "" he said .
"" I advise you to change and correct your tone and respect other nations ' rights . ""
The main sticking point to negotiations has been Iran 's refusal to stop its uranium enrichment programme .
The Bush administration insisted on this condition being met before direct talks between the US and Iran could take place , but Obama 's White House has indicated its willingness to drop the precondition .
Last week , the European foreign policy chief , Javier Solana , offered Iran the chance to sit down with the US for direct talks , along with Britain , France , Germany , Russia and China .
Iran said it welcomed a "" constructive "" dialogue , indicating its willingness to sit down for discussions on nuclear issues that have alarmed the west .
The US , Europe and Israel allege Iran intends to build a nuclear weapon and say that this is unacceptable .
Iran , the world 's fourth largest oil exporter , denies this , insisting its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes only , to help generate electricity .
Negotiations have been given added urgency by threats from the new Israeli government , led by Binyamin Netanyahu , to bomb Iran 's nuclear facilities to stop it achieving a nuclear weapons capability .
Israel predicts Iran could reach this point by the autumn .
On Sunday the Israeli president , Shimon Peres , urged Ahmadinejad to enter into the talks proposed by Obama .
If Ahmadinejad failed to back down over the nuclear issue , "" we 'll strike him "" , Peres said .
Ahmadinejad 's softer rhetoric , analysts say , may have to do with electoral calculations .
He has been criticised for deepening Iran 's isolation at a time when the US is making the diplomatic running with Obama 's overtures to Iran .
In an interview with the Financial Times yesterday , one of Ahmadinejad 's rivals in the June presidential election said he would work to provide guarantees that Tehran would not divert its nuclear programme to weapons use .
Mir - Hossein Moussavi , who is backed by Mohammad Khatami , the former reformist president , is attracting support from young Iranians – who make up the majority of the population – who are weary of Ahmadinejad 's hard line towards the west ."
2009-04-19,"An international boycott of a UN conference on racism was growing last night amid western concerns that the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and other Islamic leaders could use the meeting as a platform to attack Israel , question the reality of the Holocaust , or to try to limit the right to criticise religion .
Germany , Canada , Australia , New Zealand and the Netherlands have all joined the US and Israel in announcing their withdrawal from the Geneva conference .
British officials said they still planned to attend , but would consult other European states overnight and reconsider their presence in light of what was said at the conference .
The flashpoint may come today , on the first day of the conference , with an address and a press conference by Ahmadinejad , who has previously made comments calling into question the facts of the Holocaust and hosted a 2006 conference to review its history .
The Iranian president 's speech today , on a rare visit to western Europe , comes on the eve of Holocaust Remembrance Day , raising concerns that he will address the subject again .
The US said on Saturday that it would not be attending today 's UN conference because of what Washington said was "" objectionable "" language in a draft statement .
Australia joined the boycott yesterday , citing similar concerns .
The Geneva meeting is known as the Durban Review Conference because it is intended to follow up the World Conference Against Racism held in the South African city eight years ago , when the US and Israel walked out in anger at attempts to equate Zionism with racism .
The draft statement for this week 's conference does not single out Israel , but formally upholds the 2001 declaration , which does .
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , Navi Pillay , said she was "" shocked and deeply disappointed "" by the US boycott .
On the Guardian 's Comment is Free website today , Pillay concedes that the 2001 meeting has been "" tainted by the antisemitic behaviour of some NGOs on the sidelines "" , but she argues that the best way to tackle such issues is to participate in this week 's meeting .
British officials say the current draft text is acceptable if "" adequate language "" is included on the Holocaust and antisemitism , but they are also anxious to retain European solidarity .
Ahmadinejad 's speech and press conference will also be carefully scrutinised for his tone towards the US after Barack Obama 's recent overtures to Tehran .
The Iranian president has ruled out compromise on Iran 's nuclear programme , but has occasionally raised hopes of a thaw in US - Iranian relations , as he did yesterday when he insisted that an Iranian - American journalist , sentenced by an Iranian court to eight years in prison on espionage charges , should be guaranteed the full right to defend herself in her appeal ."
2009-04-20,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's comment that Israel came into existence "" under the pretext of Jewish suffering "" may sound unremarkable to Arabs and Muslims who are focused on the current suffering of the Palestinians .
But it will outrage most Israelis , Jews - and many others - who see a direct link between the Nazi Holocaust and the creation of the state in 1948 .
The Iranian president 's charge that Israel is a "" totally racist "" regime also jars with his own doubts about the extermination of 6 million Jews by Hitler - racism of unparalleled savagery .
Iran , Arabs and other critics of Israel often argue that Zionism equals racism because citizenship is offered automatically to any Jew but denied to dispossessed Palestinians .
Israel 's defenders say to deny the right of national self - determination to Jews is antisemitic .
Zionists see a historic and religious link with the Holy Land .
Modern Jewish immigration dates to 1882 but the events that led to the creation of Israel began in earnest in 1917 when Britain said it favoured a "" national home "" for the Jewish peopleprovided nothing be done to prejudice the rights of what were called "" non - Jewish minorities "" .
After 1945 , when the horrific human cost of the Holocaust became clear , the US and the Soviet Union backed partition into separate Jewish and Arab states .
The Palestinians rejected the UN proposal .
The plan gave the Jews 56 % of the territory but they ended up with 78 % after the fighting ."
2009-04-20,"Investigation into case of US journalist jailed as spy The parents of a US journalist jailed for alleged spying in Iran visited their daughter yesterday for the first time since she was sentenced to eight years .
Iran 's judiciary chief ordered an investigation into the case of 31-year - old Roxana Saberi , a day after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad asked Tehran 's chief prosecutor to ensure she is allowed a full defence in the appeal . ""
She seems to be OK , "" Saberi 's Iranian - born father said .
The developments appear to be a sign that Iranian officials want to ensure the case does not derail moves toward a diplomatic dialogue with the Obama administration .
Associated Press in Tehran Murder investigation into family killed by blaze Moscow authorities opened a murder investigation yesterday after a French businessman and his wife were found dead following a suspicious apartment fire .

Moscow investigative committee spokeswoman Viktoria Tsyplenkova said arson was suspected after the bodies of Thierry Spinelli and his wife Olga were found .
Their daughter was found alive but later died , she said .
The French embassy said Spinelli was a French citizen , his wife was a Russian citizen and their daughter had dual citizenship .

2009-04-21,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , dropped a controversial phrase casting doubt on the Holocaust from an address to a United Nations conference on racism , according to UN officials and Farsi interpreters .
An official Iranian text of Ahmadinejad 's address to the conference on Monday referred to "" the ambiguous and dubious question of the Holocaust "" .
However , when the president delivered the speech he omitted the phrase , referring more vaguely to "" abuse of the Holocaust "" .
He also dropped a segment about Zionist "" penetration "" of western society .
It is not clear why he deviated from the prepared text , but Ahmadinejad took the podium at the conference following a meeting with the UN secretary general , Ban Ki - moon , who had urged against the use of divisive language .
However , the speech as delivered still contained the claim that Israel had been created by western "" military aggression "" after the second world war , "" by using the pretext of Jewish sufferings and by abusing the Holocaust "" .
He described Israel as "" a completely racist regime "" and "" those racist perpetrators of genocide "" .
He also suggested the 2003 Iraq invasion was planned "" by the Zionists and their allies in the then US administration in complicity with the arms manufacturing companies and the owners of wealth "" .
The speech triggered a walkout by European countries , and a stern rebuke from Ban , who said Ahmadinejad had used the conference platform "" to accuse , divide and even incite "" .
An English text was distributed after the speech by an Iranian official who described it as an accurate transcript .
However , interpreters at the Geneva conference later confirmed some of the most offensive passages had been removed in the spoken text .
Among the excised sections was a claim that Zionists "" have been able to deeply penetrate [ western ] political and economic structures , including their legislation , mass media , companies , financial systems , and their security and intelligence agencies "" ."
2009-04-21,"Not for the first time , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has got everyone scrambling for their Farsi phrasebooks .
The Iranian president did not describe the Holocaust as "" ambiguous and dubious "" in his speech to the UN conference on racism , as first reported .
He dropped the phrase at the last minute , but not in time for it to be deleted from the English text handed out by his officials after he spoke .
In either version , Mr Ahmadinejad is hard put to disguise the views of a crude anti - semite .
And that colours how people see his remarks on the establishment of Israel .
Nobody is going to get anywhere discussing 1948 .
Matters will only progress if all sides address the here and now .
Israel has a prime minister in Binyamin Netanyahu who told Barack Obama that if the US does not stop Iran from getting the bomb , Israel will .
What greater vindication of Mr Netanyahu 's view that the Iranian nuclear programme represents an existential threat to Israel can there be than the sentiments just expressed by the Iranian president ?
Further , Mr Netanyahu uses the threat of Iran as a way of avoiding having to deal politically with Hamas as a Palestinian resistance movement .
He describes Hamas as an extension of Iran 's power .
Nor are the Palestinians any the less hostile to the notion of an Iranian supposedly championing their cause .
Washington has been drawing the opposite conclusions about how to restart talks with Iran .
Mr Obama appears to have made a concession in dropping the precondition that uranium enrichment be suspended before talks can start .
The US could soon be talking with Iran with the centrifuges spinning .
But those talks will swiftly be undermined if the view gains hold that Iran is playing for time , in the knowledge that within one or two years it would have the material it needs to build a bomb .
As it is , it is difficult enough to discern the Islamic republic 's real intentions , such are the rivalries that exist between competing power structures .
Has the Iranian president , on a rare outing to Geneva , done anything to reassure the new US administration that its pragmatism will pay off ?
It is in his country 's interests that he does .
Mr Netanyahu must be thanking Allah for the Iranian president 's timely intervention , as he prepares for his first visit to Washington .
But Mr Obama 's effort to avert another war in the Middle East is not the only potential victim of a disastrous speech .
It is grist to the mill of UN haters , whose lobbying scared the US away from the conference .
It makes whatever desire there is within the UN to investigate allegations of Israeli war crimes in Gaza that much harder to realise , as the UN as a whole is tainted by the Iranian leader 's presence at one conference .
No wonder Ban Ki - moon was furious with him ."
2009-04-21,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's president , returned home to what was officially described as a warm welcome yesterday after causing outrage at a UN anti - racism conference in Geneva , where he attacked Israel as a "" racist state "" created on the "" pretext "" of Jewish suffering .
Irna , the state news agency , reported a "" sensational scene "" awaiting Ahmadinejad in Tehran .
"" People from all walks of life , including university students , [ who ] had gathered as of the early hours of Tuesday morning , warmly welcomed their political leader at the airport , "" Irna said .
Those who opposed his speech were described as "" hooligans "" .
On Monday Ahmadinejad lambasted the creation of a "" totally racist government in occupied Palestine "" in 1948 , calling it "" the most cruel and racist regime "" .
His words prompted a co - ordinated walkout by 23 EU delegates , including those from Britain .
The US boycotted the event altogether .
But Bernard Kouchner , the French foreign minister , said the decision could hurt Barack Obama 's effort to reach out to Iran .
"" Leaving an empty chair , it 's easy , "" he said .
"" You leave , then you yell at the rest .
"" It also emerged yesterday that Ahmadinejad omitted remarks from his prepared text which described the Holocaust as ambiguous and dubious .
But he did speak of "" abusing the Holocaust "" .
He also dropped a section about Zionist "" penetration "" of western society .
It is not clear why he deviated from the text , but he took the podium following a meeting with Ban Ki - moon , the UN secretary - general , who had cautioned against the use of divisive language .
Ban said yesterday that it was "" very regretful that the conference was misused by the Iranian president for political purposes "" .
Iran 's foreign ministry attacked the walk - out .
"" Some western governments do not tolerate freedom of speech when it concerns Zionism , "" it was quoted as saying by Fars news agency .
Official Iranian media praised Ahmadinejad but Etemad , a reformist paper , called his speech controversial .
Alireza Ronaghi , correspondent for al - Jazeera TV in Tehran , said : "" Ahmadinejad 's speech seems to have had the same effect within Iran as it has abroad : antagonising his critics further while forcing his supporters into a unified position . ""
Ahmadinejad , facing an election in June , is popular in rural Iran but widely blamed for the country 's economic crisis .
Many Iranian critics say his grandstanding has brought the country into disrepute .
Tehran is at odds with the US , the west and Israel over its alleged nuclear ambitions and support for groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon .
Israel , marking its annual Holocaust memorial day , attacked the speech as "" shameful "" .
Iran was "" trying to do everything they can in order to wipe Israel off the map and at the same time to undermine the moderate Arab Muslim regimes in the Middle East , "" the deputy foreign minister , Silvan Shalom , said at the former Nazi death camp Auschwitz - Birkenau .
Syria , Iran 's only Arab ally , called for tolerance and said it was "" natural "" that there were such disagreements at a UN conference .
At the end of the conference yesterday , more than 100 countries signed a 143-point declaration to fight racism and discrimination against minorities .
The declaration also warned against stereotyping people because of their religion , a key demand of Islamic states which say Muslims have been unfairly targeted for their beliefs since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US .
Riyad al - Maliki , the Palestinian foreign minister , was applauded yesterday when he called Israel 's occupation of the West Bank "" the worst violation of human rights "" and "" the ugliest face of racism and racial discrimination "" .
But there was criticism from some Arab commentators .
"" How will the Iranian president 's speech contribute to the Palestinian issue or the good of the occupied Arab lands ? "" asked Tariq Alhomayed , editor of the al - Sharq al - Awsat newspaper .
""
All he did was push the international community to rally around Israel . ""
Victor Kattan , a UK - based Palestinian academic who was in Geneva , reported on his blog : "" Over the weekend , there was a clear attempt by the Iranian delegation at the UN to hijack the Palestine event I was attending .
They brought their own literature and leaflets with them in which they equated the Star of David with the Nazi swastika and labelled Zionism racism .

The behaviour of Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad – and the representatives of the western world in response – is pored over by today 's broadsheets featuring on page three of the Times and the Guardian , with much debate and analysis online .
Julian Borger sets the scene in the Guardian : "" It was billed as a demonstration of international solidarity behind sentiments everyone could agree on , such as tolerance , understanding and respect .
But from the moment Mahmoud Ahmadinejad rose to the lectern at yesterday 's UN conference against racism , it rapidly disintegrated into a shouting match and the world edged perceptibly further from peace .
""
The Times declares the UN 's second conference on racism "" descended into farce "" as Ahmadinejad used his speech to condemn Israel , who he said were engaging in "" the most cruel and racist regime "" .
The speech was interrupted by protesters , before western diplomats walked out en masse .
Richard Beeston , writing in the Times , said : "" President Ahmadinejad 's performance confirmed that he is determined to retain his title as uncrowned king of the world 's awkward squad and speaker of the unspeakable …
"" The Iranian leader is not merely speaking for effect .
He believes in what he says – and that most of the world supports him .
These theatrics would not matter so much if Iran was not the pivotal country in the Middle East today ; what happens there could decide whether the region is on the threshold of peace or plunged into one of the most dangerous conflicts of modern times . ""
Antony Lerman , the former director of the Institute for Jewish Policy Research , writing for the Guardian 's Comment is Free , points out that to walk out in protest was completely the wrong reaction from so many of the world 's representatives . ""
The Geneva UN gathering is an event of high seriousness … it appears to have been derailed by a publicity - seeking , not especially powerful politician , desperately campaigning for re - election .
And meanwhile , the millions whose lives are utterly blighted by racial discrimination , violence and hatred are relegated to a footnote .

2009-04-22,"President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad came back home from Geneva in a new suit instead of the famous "" Ahmadinejad 's coat "" that he normally wears , amid huge official support in Tehran .
He was welcomed at the airport by some of his supporters , students and basijis who were holding the Hamas and Palestinian flags .
The Iranian parliament , the Majlis , also made a statement congratulating him on his speech at the Durban Review Conference .
Keyhan , an Iranian radical newspaper whose former editor - in - chief now sits in Ahmadinejad 's cabinet as the culture minister , Mohammad Hossein Saffar Harandi , published a big photo of the Iranian president surrounded by people at the airport with a headline reading "" Ahmadinejad bombarded Israel with his speech "" .
The Jerusalem Post was also a focus for news media in Tehran .
State - run TV claimed the Israeli paper "" revealed that three young people yelling at Ahmadinejad in the Geneva conference had been appointed and paid by the Israeli foreign ministry "" .
The state - run broadcaster also portrayed the protesters in the conference hall as "" jesters who came into the conference with permission from the Israeli government "" .
The revelation that the walkout had been "" arranged before the speech "" has also been one of the focal point for the Iranian media .
Meanwhile , the Iranian reformist papers criticised Ahmadinejad for his action at the anti - racism conference .
Etemaad , an Iranian reformist paper which has been threatened with closure several times by the government , headlined its front page : "" Reformists object to Ahmadinejad 's behaviour in Geneva . ""
The two reformist candidates for the coming presidential election in June , Mehdi Karoubi and Mir Hossein Mousavi , also objected to Ahmadinejad 's participation in the conference .
Karoubi , who was giving a campaign speech in Arak University in central Iran , criticised him for "" putting Iranians in a situation to be humiliated "" .
Karoubi 's objection was welcomed by thousands of Iranian students who were listening to his lecture at their university .
Mousavi , who is backed in the coming presidential election by the Iranian former moderate president Mohammad Khatami , criticised government media for covering Ahmadinejad 's mistakes up by "" using heroic adjectives "" for describing what he did in the conference .
The few reformist papers that have survived Ahmadinejad 's media purge were the only sources reflecting Iranian opposition to his speech in Geneva .
One of the most important news events in Iran yesterday was an International Conference of Islamic States ' Prosecutors .
More than 200 prosecutors from 60 countries were invited to Tehran to draft a case against Israeli crimes in Gaza – calling it "" the Gaza Holocaust "" .
The conference presented 5,160 documents said to demonstrate Israeli crimes in the Gaza war .
Ahmadinejad also made a quick visit to the conference where he was applauded warmly by the prosecutors for his speech in Geneva .
A Syrian prosecutor impressed by the Iranian president 's anti - Israeli speech stood up suddenly and read a poem in his praise .
Yesterday , the state - run TV reported that 60 countries meeting in Iran had agreed on Israeli crimes and racism , while a "" few countries made a walkout of the Geneva conference and supported racism "" .
The day before yesterday , I was seated accidentally on the plane next to an international prosecutor from a non - Islamic country who had been invited to the Tehran conference .
I was astonished to find this western prosecutor admired Ahmadinejad 's "" struggles in showing the Israeli crimes in Gaza "" .
In the course of our brief chat I found this pro - Ahmadinejad western prosecutor was not aware of the detention of journalists , bloggers and women activists in Tehran 's notorious Evin prison or the juvenile executions in the country .
Antony Lerman was right to ask in his recent article for Cif : "" Since when has the UN been a children 's tea party ? ""
The west is underestimating Ahmadinejad 's capacity for playing political games and is ignoring how hasty decisions – such as the Geneva walkout – can make him more popular in Iran than before .
He is successfully distracting the whole world 's attention from the government 's mismanagements in his own country , and the west is providing him with a stage on which to do it ."
2009-04-22,"A quick quiz about three quotes , one of which is from the transcript of the speech given by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Geneva on Monday at the UN World Conference against Racism ( Durban II ) and distributed to delegates , and two of which came from another source : A. "" In our day , all the governments of the entire world are consciously or unconsciously submissive to the commands of this great supergovernment of Zion …

B. ""

"" C. "" [ Zionists have ] penetrated into the political and economic structures including their legislation , mass media , companies , financial systems and their security and intelligence agencies … to the extent that nothing can be done against their will . ""
Now , which quote is Ahmadinejad 's ?
Where are the other two quotes from and when were they made ?
Guardian readers will know the answer to the first question : it is quote C that comes from the transcript of Ahmadinejad 's speech .
But if you thought it was A or B , you could be forgiven , since all three quotes contain essentially the same discourse : all of them attribute to "" Zion "" and "" Zionism "" the same mysterious power of pervasive influence and sinister control of societies and states .
The answer to the second question puts this discourse into context .
A and B both appear in Victor Marsden 's translation of the notorious antisemitic forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , which depicts a worldwide Jewish conspiracy .
A is from the epilogue to the Russian edition of 1905 .
B is from the conclusion that Marsden added in 1934 .
But time makes no difference to a timeless trope like the antisemitic figure of "" the Jews "" : that evil , menacing group whose hidden hand controls governments , the media , the economy : the lot .
Hence the similarity that C bears to A and B. Someone might object that , unlike the Protocols , Ahmadinejad confines his attack to Zionists and does not brand Jews collectively .
But no other political movement in the world is credited with the kind of fantastical power and influence that he attributes to Zionism .
Moreover , Zionism is a Jewish movement ; and what he attributes to it is precisely the kind of power and influence that antisemitism attributes to Jews .
It 's a bit of a giveaway .
As is his embrace of Holocaust denial : no one denies ( or plays down ) the Nazi genocide against the Jews except for dyed - in - the - wool antisemites and certifiable lunatics .
Whatever else he might be , Ahmadinejad is not insane .
I have written extensively about the difference between anti - Zionism and antisemitism and the danger of conflating them .
But the one can turn into the other .
And if it is wrong to make false accusations of antisemitism , it is equally wrong to turn a blind eye when it stares us in the face .
We should not be deceived by the fact that following an intervention by Ban Ki - moon , Ahmadinejad left out one or two of the most inflammatory passages that appear in the transcript – including quote C. A last - minute response to diplomatic pressure from the UN secretary general does not constitute a change of heart .
Nor is he redeemed by his arguments on behalf of the Palestinians .
For one thing , he has his own agenda , which is not necessarily the same as theirs .
Victor Kattan , a Palestinian writer currently in Geneva , observes : "" Ahmadinejad 's comments on Israel did not come as a surprise .
Over the weekend there was a clear attempt by the Iranian delegation at the UN to hijack the Palestine event that I was attending . ""
He adds : "" It was clear that the Iranians had little if any interest in Palestine or its people . ""
But even if they did , nothing redeems bigotry .
Which brings me to the walk - out by delegates during Ahmadinejad 's speech .
It appears that the protest was triggered when he called Israel "" totally racist "" .
But the precise phrase is neither here nor there ; for whatever he says about Israel is part and parcel of a wider discourse steeped in bigotry – as quote C illustrates .
Bigotry , whether aimed at Jews or others , should never be shown respect .
Which is why those delegates , snubbing the man as he spoke , were right to walk – especially at a UN conference against racism ."
2009-04-22,"On 14 December 2005 , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became the first senior Iranian official to openly deny the Holocaust .
Addressing a crowd in the city of Zahedan , the president of Iran described the Holocaust as afsane , meaning "" myth "" in Farsi .
Until then , Iranian officials , including Ayatollah Khomeini , the founder of the revolution , focused their attacks on Zionism , and Israel , which was seen as its byproduct .
The Holocaust was left well alone , due to a number of reasons .
One is that it was viewed as part of Jewish history .
In Iran , Judaism is a respected religion , as it is mentioned in the Qur'an .
Also , in Iranian culture , attacking or questioning the religious history of others is strongly frowned upon .
Iranian culture and mannerisms views such acts as either disrespectful , extremist or even blasphemous .
There are also the political consequences .
Some people saw the Holocaust as a sensitive subject , and decided not to become involved .
The cost of touching such a sensitive subject far outweighed its benefits .
There was also a question of national pride .
Some Iranians helped to save Jews during the Holocaust , and this is something they are proud of .
Ahmadinejad 's remarks caused international outrage .
However this caused more and more people in Iran to become aware of this tragedy and made this subject into a domestic political issue .
After Israel and Germany , Iran has now become the third country in the world where the Holocaust plays a part in domestic politics .
So much so that it has now become an issue on which Iranian presidential candidates are asked to clarify their position .
First in line was Mir Hossein Mousavi , the main reformist candidate .
In a press conference on 7 April , he was asked about his views on the subject .
His reply was "" killing innocent people is condemned .
The way the issue [ Holocaust ] was put forward [ by Ahmadinejad ] was incorrect . ""
Next in line was Iran 's former parliament speaker , Hojatoleslam Mehdi Karoubi , who after coming third in the 2005 elections is running again this year .
On 20 April , the very day which Ahmadinejad was speaking in the UN anti - racism conference in Geneva , Karoubi openly confirmed the Holocaust by stating : "" The Holocaust is an event , which did take place . ""
He went on to say : "" As I said two years ago , at an event celebrating the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution in Tehran University , what kind of statement is that the Holocaust did not happen ?
This incident has definitely taken place .
It makes no difference if six thousand or six million people were killed .
The Holocaust did definitely take place .
"" What is even more interesting is that Karoubi 's party went as far as promising to respect any decision made by a Palestinian government , be it resistance against Israel or negotiations .
Before Ahmadinejad 's election , not many people dared make such statements .
However , as part of the backlash against his extremist point of view and hostile foreign policy , such taboo subjects are now being discussed openly .
Furthermore , owing to Ahmadinejad 's Holocaust remarks , many more people in Iran who had never heard of this tragedy now know the name and the fact that Jews were murdered in the second world war .
So successful has Ahmadinejad been in giving publicity to this issue that some people from the right , who are usually aligned with him , have become infuriated and have turned against him .
Dr Mehdi Khazali , son of the powerful and messianic Ayatollah Khazali went as far as stating that Ahmadinejad came from a Jewish family , and this is why he continued to give publicity to the issue .
In his blog , Khazali said that much like many prominent Shia Bazaari traders who were originally Jews , Ahmadinejad 's original surname "" Saborjian "" , which means thread painters in Farsi , had Jewish origins .
Even if Ahmadinejad is elected again , it is likely that his policies would continue to backfire , by turning into an opportunity to educate Iranians about this historic tragedy .
His competitors are also likely to confirm the event , thus leading to further confirmation that this painful event is one that should be remembered by all .
Meanwhile , there is also a lesson learned for the Israeli government .
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu decided to recall the Israeli ambassador to Switzerland , in protest at Ahmadinejad 's presence at the UN conference on racism , which took place on Swiss soil .
Jerusalem should not be angry at Switzerland .
In fact , Netanyahu must thank the Swiss government for allowing Ahmadinejad to speak .
Israel should have learned by now that whatever Ahmadinejad touches , turns to dust .
He promised to put oil money on the table of every Iranian family .
Instead , he took money away through high inflation and irresponsible expenditure policies which have ruined the Iranian economy .
Ahmadinejad promised to "" cut the hands of the corrupt "" , instead they now have longer hands with bigger biceps .
He promised to bring justice to Iranian society , instead the gap between rich and poor is growing every day .
His presence at the UN conference and his expected assault against Israel was also going to have the same results .
Because of Ahmadinejad and his one - sided speech , European countries openly demonstrated their friendship to the Jewish people , by walking out in the middle of his tirade against Israel .
They showed that while Europe is willing to criticise Israel 's policy towards the Palestinians , it is not willing to listen to officials who are questioning Israel 's right to exist .
Next time Ahmadinejad ponders launching another tirade against Israel , he would do well to note that he , more than any other Iranian president , is contributing to its survival and progress in the international community ."
2009-04-23,"What do the US , Canada , ­Australia , New Zealand , the Netherlands , Germany , Poland , Italy and Israel have in common ?
They are all either European or European - settler states .
And they all decided to boycott this week 's UN ­conference against racism in Geneva – even before Monday 's incendiary speech by the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad which triggered a further white - flight walkout by representatives of another 23 European states .
In international forums , it 's almost unprecedented to have such an ­undiluted racial divide of whites - versus - the - rest .
And for that to happen in a global meeting called to combat racial hatred does n't exactly augur well for future international understanding at a time when the worst economic crisis since the war is ramping up racism and xenophobia across the world .
Did n't Canada or Australia have anything to say about the grim condition of their indigenous people , you might wonder , or Italy and the Czech Republic about violent attacks on Roma people ?
Did n't any of the boycotters have a contribution to make about the rampant Islamophobia , resurgence of anti - semitism and scapegoating of migrants in their countries over the last decade ?
The dispute was mainly about Israel and western fears that the conference would be used , like its torrid predecessor in Durban at the height of the Palestinian intifada in 2001 , to denounce the Jewish state and attack the west over colonialism and the slave trade .
In fact , although it was the only conflict mentioned in the final Durban declaration , the reference was so mild ( recognising the Palestinian right to self - determination alongside Israel 's right to security ) that the then Israeli foreign minister , ­Shimon Peres , called it "" an accomplishment of the first order for Israel "" .
In this week 's Geneva statement , Israel is n't mentioned at all .
But the US bizarrely still used its reaffirmation of the anodyne Durban declaration to justify a boycott , to the anger of African American politicians such as Jesse Jackson and Barbara Lee , who chairs the US Congressional Black Caucus .
In fact , like the other boycotting governments , the US administration had been intensely lobbied by rightwing pro - Israel groups , who had insisted long in advance that the conference would be a "" hatefest "" .
Ahmadinejad 's grandstanding played straight into that agenda .
The most poisonous phrases in the printed version of his speech circulated by embassy officials referred to the Nazi genocide as "" ambiguous and dubious "" and claimed Zionist "" penetration "" of western society was so deep that "" nothing can be done against their will "" .
That a head of state of a country of nearly 70 million people is still toying with Holocaust denial and European antisemitic tropes straight out of the Tsarist antisemitic forgery , The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , is not only morally repugnant and factually absurd .
It 's also damaging to the Palestinian cause by association , weakens the international support Iran needs to avert the threat of attack over its nuclear programme , and bolsters Israel 's claims that it faces an existential threat .
But , perhaps as a result of an appeal by the UN secretary general Ban Ki - moon , Ahmadinejad dropped those provocations at the last minute .
What in fact triggered the walkout of European Union ambassadors was his reference to Israel as a "" totally racist regime "" , established by the western powers who had made an "" entire nation homeless under the pretext of Jewish suffering "" and "" in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in Europe "" .
The rhetoric was certainly crude and inflammatory .
Britain 's foreign secretary David Miliband called it "" hate - filled "" .
But the truth is that throughout the Arab , Muslim and wider developing worlds , the idea that Israel is a racist state is largely uncontroversial .
The day after Ahmadinejad 's appearance , the Palestinian Authority foreign minister , Riyad al - Maliki , echoed the charge in the conference hall , describing Israeli occupation as "" the ugliest face of racism "" .
It 's really not good enough for Britain 's ambassador to the UN in Geneva , Peter Gooderham – who led the Ahmadinejad walkout – to say of the charge of Israel 's racism , "" we all know it when we see it
and it 's not that "" .
This is a state , after all , created by European colonists , built on the ethnic cleansing of the indigenous population , whose founding legal principles guarantee the right of citizenship to any Jewish migrant from anywhere in the world , while denying that same right to Palestinians born there along with their descendants .
Of course , Israel is much else besides , and the Jewish cultural and historical link with Palestine is a ­profound one .
But even those Palestinians who are Israeli citizens face what the then Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert last year called "" deliberate and ­insufferable "" discrimination by a state which defines itself by ethnicity .
For Palestinians in the occupied territories , ruled by Israel for most of the state 's existence , where ­ethnic segregation and extreme ­inequality is ruthlessly enforced , the situation is far worse – even without the relentless military assaults and killings .
And Israel now has a far - right ­government whose foreign minister , Avigdor Lieberman , has said 90 % of Israel 's Arab citizens have "" no place "" in the country , should be forcibly "" transferred "" , and only be allowed citizenship in exchange for an oath of loyalty to Israel as a Zionist Jewish state .
But if Lieberman had turned up to speak at the Geneva anti - racism conference , who believes that western delegates and ambassadors would have staged a walkout ?
Of course , there 's a perfectly ­reasonable argument to be had about the nature of Israel 's racism and whether it should be compared to apartheid , for example .
But for western governments to hold up their hands in horror when Israel is described as a racist state has no global credibility whatever .
Israel 's supporters often complain that , whatever its faults , it is singled out for attack while the crimes of other states and conflicts are ignored .
To the extent that that 's true in forums such as the UN , it 's partly because Israel is seen as the unfinished business of European colonialism , along with the Middle East conflict 's other special mix of multiple toxins .
The Geneva boycotters , fresh from standing behind Israel 's carnage in Gaza , are in denial about their own racism – and their continuing role in the tragedy of the Middle East .

This article was amended on Friday 24 April 2009 .
We originally referred to Shimon Peres as Israel 's prime minister in 2001 , he was actually the foreign minister at that time .
This has been corrected ."
2009-04-26,"The restless nature of Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has long been a headache for the bodyguards charged with preserving his safety .
Not content with plunging into crowds during his frequent public appearances , Ahmadinejad has been known to drive alone and unprotected at night to deprived neighbourhoods to meet families who lost relatives during Iran 's 1980 - 88 war with Iraq .
He has dismissed advice that his habits could make him a sitting duck for potential assassins .
Now his worried security team has identified a new threat to his person - the many letters he receives from voters during his trips across Iran .
Ahmadinejad has actively encouraged the public to write to him in a drive to boost his populist image .
But advisers have warned that the letters could contain poisonous substances intended to kill him . ""
To prevent him getting poisoned , the security team have warned him in several cases to be careful about the letters which are given to him on his provincial trips , "" reported Jahan News , a website close to the security services . ""
But Dr Ahmadinejad in response has declared he is going to behave as before . ""
Since being elected in 2005 , Ahmadinejad has received millions of letters , many pleading for money or help with personal problems .
He has pledged to read as many as possible and instructed his aides to respond to every message sent to him .
The president 's insistence on meeting the public has forced his guards into extraordinary measures - including deploying a team of sniffer dogs to detect explosives , despite Islam 's customary disdain for dogs ."
2009-04-28,"Barack Obama 's offer of a hand of friendship to Iran after 30 years of hostility may have met with a sceptical public response from Tehran .
But now a rapprochement of sorts may be under way amid evidence that the US president 's can - do electioneering tactics have struck a chord with his Iranian counterpart , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Obama 's signature campaign slogan ,
Yes We Can , has been replicated by the Iranian president in a promotional video issued for Iran 's presidential poll on 12 June , when Ahmadinejad is seeking re - election .
The video features a cover picture of Ahmadinejad wearing his trademark white jacket and pointing to the Farsi phrase Ma Mitavanim
( We Can ) on a blackboard .
The film is aimed at students and capitalises on his former status as a university lecturer .
Its release coincides with that of another campaign video apparently attempting to trump Obama by recounting Ahmadinejad 's visit to Turkey .
Obama won international acclaim during a visit to Turkey this month for declaring that the US was "" not at war "" with Islam and stressing that there were Muslims in his family .
Ahmadinejad 's visit last August was arguably less successful .
The Islamist president was deprived of full state honours after declining to pay homage to the tomb of Turkey 's secular founder , Ataturk , in Ankara .
He also endured the indignity of Turkey withdrawing from an anticipated lucrative natural gas contract , partly because of American pressure .
There was further discord when Istanbul residents complained of huge traffic jams caused by security measures for the visit .
The films have been distributed during Ahmadinejad 's recent public appearances in and around Tehran .
Another video focuses on his provincial trips across Iran , a hallmark of his presidency .
Ahmadinejad 's surprise election win four years ago was partly attributed to a promotional film that depicted him as a humble man who empathised with the poor ."
2009-05-05,"She preserves her modesty underneath an all - encompassing black chador and has written essays urging Muslim women not to renounce the veil .
But now Zahra Rahnavard is heralding a sexual transformation in Iran 's male - dominated politics by capturing the limelight in her husband 's bid to become president .
In a radical departure for the Islamic republic , Rahnavard has accompanied her husband , Mir Hosein Mousavi , to a succession of rallies as he seeks to unseat Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the presidential election on 12 June .
Mousavi , 67 , who is running as a reformist , has shared platforms with his wife at numerous recent appearances , including one in Mazandaran province at which supporters chanted : "" Death to the Taliban – whether in Kabul or Tehran . ""
Now Iran 's media have dubbed Rahnavard , 61 , the country 's next "" first lady "" , and have drawn comparisons with Barack Obama 's wife , Michelle .
"" What is new and unprecedented is that previously none of the presidential campaign candidates has stood beside his spouse in election campaigns and that is exactly contrary to what is common in the US , "" the reformist newspaper Etemaad wrote under the headline From Michelle Obama to Zahra Rahnavard .
Wives on the campaign trail are unheard of in a country whose interpretation of Sharia law has been criticised for denying women equal rights and which has not had a female cabinet minister since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
Although the constitution does not expressly forbid women from becoming president , no female has ever been approved as a candidate by the powerful Guardian Council 's vetting process .
Rahnavard has used her status as a respected sculptor and intellectual to break the mould .
Besides accompanying her husband , she has written articles drumming up support for his campaign .
One piece called for the election to focus on removing discrimination against women .
Her visibility contrasts with the low profile of Ahmadinejad 's wife , Azam Al Sadat Faraahi , who , in her rare public appearances , is often seen using her chador to conceal her face .
Rahnavard , who holds a PhD in political science and lived in exile in the US during the shah 's reign , is an unlikely women 's rights campaigner by western standards .
She has written essays entitled The Colonial Motives for the Unveiling of Women and The Beauty of the Veil and the Veil of Beauty .
But , despite women 's second - class status in Iranian politics , Rahnavard is no stranger to the public realm .
She was an adviser to the reformist former president Mohammad Khatami , and chancellor of al - Zahra university in Tehran , the first Iranian woman to hold such a position .
She provoked controversy by inviting the Nobel prize - winning human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi to address the university and left her post amid a purge of reformist academics following Ahmadinejad 's election win in 2005 .
Mousavi , who was Iran 's prime minister from 1981 to 1989 , is not the only current candidate to promote women 's issues .
Two others , Mehdi Karroubi , a fellow reformist and former parliament speaker , and Mohsen Rezai , a conservative and one - time revolutionary guard commander , have pledged to appoint a female cabinet member ."
2009-05-08,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , officially declared yesterday that he would run for a second term in next month 's election .
Ahmadinejad 's candidacy will pit the hardline president , who has pushed anti - western rhetoric and a pro - nuclear stance , against the former prime ­minister , Mirhossein Mousavi , a more moderate candidate .
Mousavi , who has said he will "" save "" the Iranian economy if elected , is expected to register his candidacy today .
He accused Ahmadinejad of pushing Iran to "" the edge of a precipice . ""
"" Each election should be a launchpad for higher aims and a new start for the nation , "" Ahmadinejad said .
"" My duty is to announce my readiness to serve the people . ""
The election will be a popularity test for the president , since he won the 2005 ­election promising to share out the country 's oil wealth more fairly and to revive the values of the 1979 Islamic revolution .
His popularity has split opinion , with some conservatives accusing him of squandering oil revenue and isolating Iran from the rest of the world during his four - year term in office .
The president has become increasingly unpopular due to a worsening economic situation in the country .
Reformists hope a new president will ease social and political restrictions at home and create stronger ties with the west .
Mohsen Rezaei , a former head of Iran 's Revolutionary Guards , is also expected to stand in the election on 12 June but is not considered a leading challenger .
However his election campaign , which will focus on Iran 's economic problems , could draw votes away from Ahmadinejad , weakening the president .
"" We 've come to save the country 's economy .
The economy is in need of fundamental changes .
We will cure it through formation of a coalition government , "" Rezaei told a press conference after formally registering as a candidate .
Rezaei , who is wanted by Interpol over the 1994 bombing of a Jewish centre in Argentina , has also criticised Ahmadinejad 's foreign policy , saying his denial of the Holocaust was of "" no benefit "" to Iran ."
2009-05-13,""" In Iran there are no homosexuals like in America , "" the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , declared during a visit to the US , sparking a media frenzy .
Some questioned the translation and Ahmadinejad later clarified his words , interpreting "" like "" as "" not in the same way as "" .
Whatever his intention , it is clear to whoever explores the colourful realms of sexual "" dissent "" across the world , that notions of homosexuality vary – and particularly in the Middle East .
Nadi , an androgynous - looking Lebanese friend , was walking in a German underground station when he crossed the path of a Middle Eastern man and his German girlfriend .
As the man winked to Nadi and blew him a kiss , the woman stuttered in shock : "" But ... but it 's a man ! ""
For most people in wealthy , industrialised and over - rationalised societies , "" gay "" and "" straight "" are two separate worlds .
A person can be either one or the other , or else they would have to fit the "" bisexual "" category .
Bisexuality is often misunderstood by both gay and straight people and discussions abound about "" real "" and "" fake "" bisexuals .
As for the "" T "" in "" LBGT "" , it represents transgendered persons , still too often associated with psychiatry .
A "" Q "" has recently been tagged on the end of "" LGBT "" , pertaining to the sophisticated "" queer "" concept elaborated by high - priests of American academia .
The need to create boxes seems limitless .
Many forget that these appellations date back to the 1960s at the most and that other , more "" traditional "" forms of same - sex relationships pre - dated the "" gay liberation "" movement .
In many cultures , for instance – and despite various taboos – having sex with someone of the same gender had often been seen as a light - hearted , inconsequential rite of passage for almost every teenager .
There was also the central figure of the "" sissy "" or "" fairy "" , whose worlds were beautifully described in George Chauncey 's Gay New York .
Many , such as Quentin Crisp , revelled in this role .
With the advent of compulsive sex consumerism dominated by heterosexual imagery – and decried by such intellectuals as Pier Paolo Pasolini – rites of passage became redundant .
As for "" fairies "" , the burgeoning gay movement decreed that they were a symbol of oppression and humiliation , that men who behaved like women only did so because they were coerced into it .
With this faux - macho attitude that is still prevalent today , some gay advocates had more in common with their archenemies than they originally thought .
New categories and identities emerged .
To fit the norm now meant to exclusively have sex with the opposite biological gender .
On the other hand , if one was gay , one had to subscribe to a newly - crafted sphere , with its dress codes , its own institutions and dogmas , conformists and dissidents , its haves – beneficiaries of the "" pink pound "" – and its have - nots .
In reaction to this rise in power and visibility of the new gay scene , many heterosexual men felt threatened in their imagined masculinity .
Some took refuge in anxious and desperate forms of virility , such as hooliganism , where insults and physical attacks on gays are ritualised .
One response to a newly - organised more separate gay world was increasingly radicalised homophobia .
Simultaneously , international gay rights organisations started pointing fingers at countries in the economic south and the Middle East , accusing them of being backward and homophobic while often ignoring their local homoerotic traditions and trying to impose ready - made gay rights concepts on them .
Western visitors to southern or Middle - Eastern countries are often perplexed , not only by open homosocial affection but also by the presence of a thriving homosexual "" underworld "" .
For if two men holding hands in public does not necessarily mean that they are romantically tied , it certainly opens the doors of possibility .
In Pakistan , a popular drag queen hosts a TV show tackling serious current issues .
Asked by a stunned French reporter whether she was advocating LGBTQ rights , she replied : "" Darling , these categories do not apply in my culture . ""
As much as it is hard to imagine a cross - dresser hosting a political show in France , it is easy to notice that for the reporter , visibility equals political statement .
Categories are indeed different .
Since times immemorial , when assinnus served in temples of Ishtar , "" ambivalent "" men have been an integral part of social , religious and economic life in the Middle East .
To this day , many of these "" third sex "" members can be seen in everyday Middle - Eastern life .
Beyond "" ladyboys "" , a certain form of bisexuality at large is considered as an essential component of human sexuality in many Middle - Eastern countries .
Being exclusively "" straight "" or "" gay "" are exceptions .
This "" bisexuality "" follows certain codes : between two men , one partner is necessarily "" active "" and the other "" passive "" .
However , this apparent rigidity , a handy concession to society , often hides an unsuspected flexibility in the private realm .
Boundaries between what people in western societies would call "" LG "" , "" B "" or "" T "" become quite thin and all labels tend to disappear .
This openness is often mirrored in public places .
In the suburbs of Beirut lies a karaoke club connected to a football field which , along with the footballers , attracts many highly flamboyant men .
Miming to the latest Arab divas ' songs , these modern assinnus are immensely popular among the crowd of both men and women .
Some "" analysts "" put down this sexual flexibility in the Middle East to a supposed "" unavailability "" of women .
Not only does this stem from prejudice , but it is also easily discarded by all the non - Muslim countries with similar attitudes .
The simple fact is that all these cultures have remained true to their innermost inclinations , to principles of their original nature - religions – what some call "" paganism ""
– despite all the efforts of religious institutions to impose their taboos and despite the endeavours of colonialists to "" civilise "" them by instating anti - homosexuality laws .
The aim here is not to portray a "" corrupt "" western society versus a "" pure "" one in the south and east .
This "" purity "" illusion has long ago been shattered by anthropologists .
As much as there is no black or white in matters of human sexuality , there is none in gay rights .
The aim should be to abandon the west - versus - the - rest monologue where one side dictates to the other and engage instead in a real dialogue which embraces this unfathomable cultural diversity in the face of an ongoing "" McDonaldisation "" of sexual identities and practices ."
2009-05-14,"For 30 years it has been the signature slogan of Iran 's revolutionary lexicon , swearing an oath of death upon America , Britain , Israel , Saddam Hussein and sundry other presumed enemies .
Now the once chilling "" death to "" chant , an expression of zealous radicalism still heard at Friday prayers and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's rallies , has been unleashed on a new and unlikely object of wrath : the potato . ""
Death to potatoes "" ( "" marg bar sibzamini "" in Farsi ) has been adopted as a mantra by anti - Ahmadinejad campaigners in Iran 's forthcoming presidential ­election .
Supporters of Mir Hossein Mousavi , a former prime minister who has positioned himself to woo the reformist vote , chanted the slogan this week at a rally in Yasouj in central Iran .
Demonstrators were rallying against the government 's policy of giving away free potatoes in what Ahmadinejad 's opponents brand a blatant attempt to buy votes and distract attention from an economy blighted by high inflation and rising unemployment .
Ahmadinejad 's presidency has been marked by discontent over the increasing cost of basic food and vegetables .
Officials say the great potato giveaway was prompted by a surplus resulting from a bumper crop .
The practice first came to light at a rally in March by the reformist former ­president Mohammad Khatami , near Shiraz , when sacks of spuds were handed out from trucks to supporters in a gesture organised by the local governor , who was appointed by Ahmadinejad .
Khatami , who had announced his candidacy but later withdrew , said it was a ploy to undermine him and draw away potential voters .
The government initially denied involvement but later acknowledged it amid a flurry of giveaways at state offices , universities and hospitals .
A visit by Ahmadinejad to Isfahan coincided with 20 kg sacks of potatoes being sold for just 34p at two of the city 's universities .
With potatoes forming a major part of Iran 's diet , the public has eagerly snapped up the freebies .
The government has dismissed claims of pre - election bribery and said it was a choice between distributing the potatoes and letting them rot .
Abbas Rajaei , chairman of the Iranian parliament 's agriculture committee , attributed the excess crop to high tariffs , which had prevented them from being exported .
He denied suggestions they had been part of an Iranian aid package shipped to Palestinians in Gaza but subsequently turned back by Israel .
Either way , there is little doubt that potatoes have trumped weightier matters such as Iran 's nuclear programme or relations with the US as campaign issues .
Supporters of another reformist candidate , Mehdi Karroubi , echoed the objections of Mousavi 's supporters this week when they chanted "" We do n't want potato government "" at a rally in Isfahan .
The giveaway was denounced by Hassan Rowhani , who as Iran 's former chief nuclear negotiator once addressed more strategic questions .
But perhaps the pithiest criticism came from a Karroubi adviser , Abbas Abdi , who said : "" Why not onions ?
Onions are far more expensive than potatoes .
If they really wanted to help , they would give away free onions . """
2009-05-20,"Iran test - fired a solid - fuel missile capable of reaching Israel or US bases in the Middle East today , drawing rebukes from western governments and forcing the abrupt cancellation of a diplomatic mission by Italy 's foreign minister .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced the launch of the Sajjil-2 surface - to - surface missile in Semnan province , in northern Iran , claiming it landed "" precisely on target "" .
The defence minister , Mostafa Mohammad Najjar , said the missile was "" equipped with a new navigation system as well as precise and sophisticated sensors "" .
Western officials confirmed the launch and said the Sajjil appeared to be a two - stage solid - fuel missile with a range of about 1,250 miles ( 2,000 km ) .
The Foreign Office said it "" underlines profound concerns about Iran 's intentions and sends exactly the wrong signal to the region and the world at a time the international community is trying to engage Iran "" .
The incident came two days after Barack Obama warned Iran had until the end of the year to respond to his diplomatic overtures and enter into serious , "" good faith "" negotiations over its nuclear programme .
Iran insists the programme is for energy - generation purposes , but the UN security council has demanded Tehran suspend enrichment of uranium on the grounds that Iran has so far failed to convince the international community that its intentions are peaceful .
The launch led to the cancellation of a two - day visit to Iran by Italy 's Franco Frattini , who was close to boarding a plane to Tehran when he heard that Ahmadinejad insisted on meeting him in Semnan , the site of the launch .
The minister called off the whole trip , fearing Ahmadinejad would use it as a propaganda coup ahead of presidential elections next month .
The president and three challengers were officially approved today to take part in the vote by the electoral watchdog , the Guardian Council , out of 475 hopefuls .
The planned Frattini visit had been the source of considerable tension within Europe .
The British and French governments had urged him not to go , arguing that it would help Ahmadinejad electorally and show a lack of western unity .
An earlier version of the Sajjil was tested in November last year .
The Sajjil-2 appears to have a slightly longer range than the prototype .
Mark Fitzpatrick , an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies , said the development of the Sajjil missile was significant because of the type of fuel it used , rather than its range .
"" To be able to build a solid - fuel missile of medium range represents a significant technological breakthrough , "" Fitzpatrick said .
"" It is technically more difficult than a liquid - fuel missile , and militarily more significant because it is not as vulnerable to attack while being fuelled . """
2009-05-23,"President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran fired a shot yesterday across the bows of reformist candidates opposing him in the country 's presidential elections - saying that he would rebut their increasingly strident criticisms of his style of government .
During a visit to the city of Khorramshahr , Ahmadinejad returned to the theme that has dominated his increasingly bellicose campaign for re - election since it was launched officially last week - Iranian military power .
On Wednesday , Ahmadinejad used the launch of a new missile capable of hitting Israel and Europe as an election backdrop , while yesterday he invoked the dead from the Iran - Iraq war in a port city that became a symbol of that conflict .
Ahmadinejad 's opponents , however , are pointing to his failures on the domestic front , and have criticised his foreign policy as being pointlessly aggressive .
Responding to these charges for the first time since campaigning began , Ahmadinejad told local reporters in Tehran he would answer criticisms of his four years as president during the televised debates .
He suggested criticism of him was a breach of "" election law "" , according to the Islamic Republic News Agency . ""
Under the election law , nobody has the right to do candidates any harm .
Distortion of one 's image is an offence .
As for the second mistake , it should be said that those people will fail to prove many of the allegations they raise against [ my ] government . ""
Four years ago Ahmadinejad appealed to his country 's poor as the underdog candidate .
Now it is opposition reformists in the Islamic state who are hoping to convert a widespread sense of disappointment with Ahmadinejad 's failure to transform the lives of ordinary people into an electoral lever with which to remove him when the country goes to the polls on 12 June .
The reformists , who seek better relations with the west and easing of social and political restrictions at home , have criticised Ahmadinejad for focusing on duelling with the US and Israel , rather than the faltering economy .
Ahmadinejad responded on Friday by comparing his enemies to dogs .
"" If you retreat , they attack ; if you attack , they retreat , "" he said .
With just over 46 million Iranians eligible to vote , who wins is likely to come down to voter turnout after less than three weeks of official campaigning .
If less than 27 million votes are cast , analysts believe , it would favour Ahmadinejad , who can count on 13 million votes from those who favour hardliners .
A bigger turnout - in excess of 30 million - would move the polls towards the reformists Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi .
All candidates were approved by a constitutional watchdog on Wednesday after being screened for their allegiance to Iran 's Islamic government system and "" absolute obedience "" to the country 's top authority , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
For his part , Khamenei has called on people to vote for an anti - western candidate - interpreted as a call to support Ahmadinejad .
Ahmadinejad 's biggest problem is likely to be that he is being confronted by heavyweight opponents with name recognition : Karroubi is a senior cleric , Mousavi a former prime minister .
Karroubi urged supporters at a rally on Friday to show up at the polls .
"" Staying away from the elections does n't help ...
If people vote in large numbers , the situation will change , "" he insisted .
His campaign manager , Gholam - Hossein Karbaschi , said a high turnout can definitely unseat Ahmadinejad .
"" If more than 32 million votes are cast , the possibility that Ahmadinejad will not win is over 65 % , "" he said .
"" But if 27 million people or less vote , the likelihood of a change is less than 35 % . """
2009-05-24,"Iran has blocked access to Facebook , prompting government critics to condemn the move as an attempt to muzzle the opposition before next month 's presidential election .
Blogs and websites such as Facebook have become an important campaign tool for the leading reformist candidate , Mir Hossein Mousavi , to mobilise Iran 's critical youth vote before the June 12 vote .
Iranian authorities often block specific websites and blogs considered critical of the Islamic regime , but the timing of the latest clampdown suggested it was intended to undermine opponents of the hardline president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . ""
Every single media outlet that is seen as competition for Ahmadinejad is at risk of being closed , "" said Shahab Tabatabaei , a top aide of Mousavi .
"" Placing limits on the competition is the top priority of the government . ""
Tabatabaei said the Facebook block was "" a swift reaction "" to a major pro - Mousavi rally yesterday in a Tehran sports stadium which included an appearance by former reformist president Mohammad Khatami and many young people waving green banners and scarves – the colour of the Mousavi campaign . ""
Facebook is one of the only independent sources that the Iranian youth could use to communicate , "" said Mohammed Ali Abtahi , a former vice - president and now adviser to another pro - reform candidate , Mahdi Karroubi , a former parliament speaker .
Abtahi said the loss of Facebook – and possibly other websites popular with reformists – would leave Iranians "" forced to rely on government sources "" such as state - run media before the election .
Ahmadinejad is in a four - way race against the two pro - reform candidates and fellow conservative Mohsen Rezaei .
Facebook said it was a "" shame "" when political concerns resulted in limits on opportunities for online expression .
"" We are disappointed to learn of reports that users in Iran may not have access to Facebook , especially at a time when voters are turning to the internet as a source of information about election candidates and their positions , "" the company said in a statement .
The internet and other technology have increasingly become part of Iranian political movements in the past decade .
During the last presidential race , in 2005 , information about rallies and campaign updates were sent by text message .
In recent years , political blogs by Iranians in the country and abroad have grown sharply .
Newcomers such as Twitter are also gaining in popularity ."
2009-05-25,"If Mahmoud Ahmadinejad thought he could keep critics at bay by making his government a family affair , then he failed to anticipate the rancour that erupts when relatives start feuding among themselves .
The Iranian president has come under a withering assault from his daughter 's father - in - law , who helped mastermind his unexpected 2005 election victory .
Ahmad Khorshidi , a one - time member of Ahmadinejad 's so - called "" brains trust "" , has thrown family loyalties to the winds by dismissing the president as "" third rate "" and expressing regret for having campaigned for him .
He also attacked the calibre of the cabinet , claiming that only two ministers hold genuine university degrees and that the rest have forged certificates .
The most personal criticism is reserved for the president 's brother , who was head of a powerful inspectorate before being sacked last year .
Davoud Ahmadinejad considered himself a "" major stakeholder "" in his brother 's victory and was guilty of "" irresponsible interference "" in important issues , Khorshidi said .
He accused the sacked brother of behaviour "" unworthy of a human being or a Muslim "" and of "" fabricating cases "" against people .
This attack is all the more galling having come in an interview with a reformist newspaper , Etemad - e Melli .
Its owner , Mehdi Karroubi , is a candidate in the presidential election on 12 June .
Mir - Hossein Mousavi , a leftwing former prime minister , and Mohsen Rezai , an ex - revolutionary guard commander , are also running against Ahmadinejad .
Asked if he regretted his efforts on Ahmadinejad 's behalf , Khorshidi – whose son , Mehdi , is married to the president 's only daughter – replied : "" Yes .
We started our efforts for his victory between two and three years before the election because we wanted him to win .
But now I regret it and feel I have committed a bad error . ""
He said he felt positive towards "" all the approved candidates except Ahmadinejad "" , but would vote for Rezai .
Khorshidi 's comments have caused a breach with his son , who has defended his father - in - law .
Ahmadinejad has made a habit of installing relatives in important posts .
He appointed a nephew , Ali Akbar Mehrabian , as industry minister , and made a brother - in - law , Hossein Shobeiri , head of a government fund to promote marriage .
Ahmadinejad appeared unfazed today , telling reporters that if re - elected he would seek a face - to - face debate with Barack Obama at the UN to discuss "" world issues and the way towards peace "" .
The Iranian president has made a habit of installing relatives in important posts .
He appointed a nephew , Ali Akbar Mehrabian , as industry minister , and a brother - in - law , Hossein Shobeiri , as head of a government fund to promote marriage ."
2009-05-27,"Iran restored access to Facebook yesterday after a block on the social networking website last week generated accusations that the government was trying to muzzle one of the main presidential campaign tools of the reformist opposition .
Facebook was cut off on Saturday , depriving challengers to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of a critical means of reaching out for the youth vote in the 12 June election .
The main pro - reform candidate , Mir Hossein Mousavi , is seeking a strong turnout from young voters and has used Facebook to try to mobilise support .
Authorities have not directly commented on the Facebook outage and the reason for its return was not immediately clear .
It is not known whether the renewed access is permanent .
In the past , Iranian authorities have restored then reimposed blocks on websites .
Iranian authorities often block specific sites and blogs considered critical of the Islamic regime .
Critics said the shutdown of Facebook forced Iranians to rely on the government for information , depriving the election debate of important independent voices .
More than half of Iranians were born after the 1979 Islamic revolution and young voters make up a huge bloc – which helped the former reformist president , Mohammad Khatami , to back - to - back victories in 1997 and 2001 .
But the youth vote failed to rally strongly behind Ahmadinejad 's opponent , Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , four years ago .
Young voters are now strongly courted by Mousavi as the possible swing factor .
An aide to Mousavi said over the weekend that the Facebook block was a reaction to a major pro - Mousavi rally on Saturday in a Tehran sports stadium that included an appearance by Khatami and many young people waving green banners and scarves – the symbolic colour of the Mousavi campaign ."
2009-05-27,"David Miliband , the foreign secretary , played down hopes that Iran 's forthcoming presidential election might help resolve the country 's dispute with the west over its nuclear programme , saying the presidency was secondary to the theocratic leadership .
In remarks likely to offend candidates vying to unseat the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , in next month 's poll , Miliband said Iran was "" governed from the top down "" by its supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the country 's most powerful cleric .
Asked if a compromise over Iran 's uranium enrichment programme was more likely if Ahmadinejad were to be defeated by a more moderate figure , he said : "" You know as well as I do that Iran is governed from the top
and that is the supreme leader .
"" Pressed to acknowledge whether that meant that whoever held the presidency was irrelevant , he went on : "" I choose my words carefully .
I said Iran is governed from the top down .
Given British history in Iran , the last thing I 'm going to do is start interfering in their election campaign .
"" Ahmadinejad has attacked his three challengers – Mir Hossein Mousavi , Mehdi Karroubi and Mohsen Rezai – for favouring detente with the west .
Mousavi , a reformist and former prime minister widely seen as his leading adversary in the 12 June election , has criticised the president for unnecessarily belligerent foreign policy and favours a more conciliatory response to President Barack Obama 's attempts at engagement .
However , he has dismissed the possibility of Iran abandoning uranium enrichment , a process the west fears may be used to build a nuclear bomb .
Iran 's leaders insist it is aimed at generating electricity .
This week , Ahmadinejad declared the country 's nuclear file "" closed "" and said it would only engage the west on broader issues of global security and nuclear proliferation .
He also dismissed the west 's offer of a "" freeze - for - freeze "" deal under which Iran would agree to suspend further enrichment in return for an end to further economic sanctions .
Miliband said the key to a solution was for Iran to show it was not trying to obtain nuclear weapons , and appeared to leave the door open to a compromise short of an immediate enrichment freeze .
"" We have not specified any way in which they can meet the requirements that there are only peaceful aims to this programme , "" he said when asked whether it was possible that Iran could continue to enrich .
"" We have left open the range of ways in which they could meet that requirement but the requirement of confidence by the international community is absolutely clear .
"" Miliband was talking at the British embassy in Ankara during a visit to Turkey aimed at displaying Britain 's backing for Turkey 's bid to join the EU .
He said the next six to nine months were vital for the future of Turkey - EU relations .
Referring to efforts to solve the 35-year - old dispute in Cyprus , he added : "" This is a year in a generation because there is a real need for a settlement .
The status quo is untenable . """
2009-05-29,"Iranians will go to the polls on 12 June to elect a new president .
While some argue that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's re - election is a foregone conclusion , the outcome is , in fact , not at all clear .
Iran 's Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has repeatedly said in public settings that he will not declare his preference among the candidates .
Indeed , in Mashhad on 21 March , Ayatollah Khamenei said , "" There were some rumours that I support a special candidate for the presidential elections .
But I have one vote , and I would not determine a certain candidate because the people themselves should choose their candidates based on their own knowledge . ""
So how will the Iranian people weigh their votes ?
To answer , one needs to understand the composition of the Iranian electorate .
With the voting age set at just 16 years , Iran has roughly 48 million eligible voters .
Turnout averages 60 - 65 % in presidential elections , implying that around 29 million votes are likely to be cast .
Analysts point to several electoral cleavages , particularly the urban - rural split and socioeconomic status .
Moreover , a key determinant of voting behaviour in the upcoming elections is likely to be generational .
Some 46 % of the electorate is under the age of 30 .
In previous elections , younger voters have turned out in greater numbers than their elders , leading some to predict that half of the voters will be in the 16-to-29 age bracket .
The number of potential first - time voters ( 16- to 19-years - old ) is estimated at six million .
Several factors distinguish members of this group from the rest of the Iranian electorate .
They are more educated , more urbanised and more internationally oriented than previous generations .
More of them are university educated , and , of this group , a majority is female .
They have branched out into new lines of work and social engagement , as inventors , entrepreneurs , and bloggers .
No candidate can be elected president of Iran without significant support among younger voters .
Age , not social class , will determine the outcome of June 's election .
Like all Iranians , younger voters are focused on economic issues , particularly the difficult combination of high inflation and high unemployment .
The populist policies of the past four years have not brought economic improvement .
Younger Iranians have a particular economic concern as well .
With so many of them graduating from universities , they suffer from a mismatch between their qualifications and the jobs on offer .
Underemployment is deeply frustrating to them .
They also want a more liberal social environment that would loosen restrictions on their dress , broaden access to cultural products such as film and music , and enlarge press freedoms .
They want university campuses , in particular , to be more open .
Finally , younger Iranians are tired of Iran 's international isolation .
They want Iran to succeed – and to be recognised for its success – in sports , arts , and education at an international level .
One seemingly unrelated event to watch : in the week before the presidential vote , Iran will play two critical football matches as part of the qualifying round for the 2010 World Cup .
If Iran fails to qualify , this could turn some young voters against the incumbent .
Among the four candidates – Ahmadinejad , Mir - Hossein Moussavi , former parliamentary speaker Mehdi Karroubi and the former head of Iran 's Revolutionary Guards , Mohsen Rezai – who will pick up this slack ?
Moussavi , Iran 's prime minister between 1981 and 1989 , is barely known to young voters .
However , his campaign has been hinting that , if elected , Moussavi will loosen some social and cultural restrictions .
Karroubi , too , is handicapped among the young .
Many consider him to be an old , out - of - touch cleric with no feel for their concerns .
Former president Mohammad Khatami , who openly considered trying again for the office , would have been a strong candidate for young voters .
His decision not to run disappointed many of them .
Without a voice for their concerns , Iran 's young people face the prospect of increased frustration , whatever the outcome of the election .

2009-05-30,"Approaching its presidential election , Iran is in the midst of a censorship drive by the Ahmadinejad government , aimed at blocking his reformist rivals ' message .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is running against two reformist candidates , Mir - Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi , and one fundamentalist , Mohsen Rezai , in the election on 12 June .
Facebook and Twitter were among hundreds of websites and blogs filtered recently because they provide a platform for reformist candidates to reach out to Iranian youth .
Moussavi , a Facebook member and pro - reform candidate who is now backed by former moderate president Mohammad Khatami , is becoming Ahmadinejad 's main rival in the election .
Facebook was restored after being blocked for a week when a CNN reporter asked Ahmadinejad publicly about its filtering in a press conference , but "" access is denied "" is rapidly becoming the most - viewed page for Iran 's online society .
A strong debate on Moussavi and Karroubi , the two reformist candidates , is being conducted on Facebook , while there is little sign of support for Ahmadinejad on the social networking website .
Yas - e - No , a reformist newspaper affiliated to Moussavi , was also closed down by the ministry of culture and Islamic guidance on 16 May.
The issue of Yas - e - No , which carried the headline "" Khatami - Moussavi for Iran "" along with a photo of the two men together , was its first after a five - year hiatus .
The paper was initially closed down in February 2004 for publishing an open letter from Iranian MPs to Ayatollah Khamenei , the supreme leader , criticising the Guardian Council 's vetting of candidates for parliamentary elections .
The Guardian Council , whose 12 members are directly appointed by the supreme leader , has to approve all candidates for any Iranian elections .
IRIB ( Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting ) , the state broadcaster , is also censoring reformist candidates ' appearances on state - run TV .
The seven state - run channels are the main source of information for most of the population in Iran , a country with little independent print media , no legal non - official TV channels and heavy internet filtering .
IRIB , whose director is also appointed by the supreme leader , has a key role in the Iranian elections – and a huge influence on provincial votes .
Karroubi criticised IRIB when his official campaign speech was censored by state - run TV last week .
Reformist candidates have criticised IRIB in recent weeks for taking Ahmadinejad 's side .
Karroubi has openly criticised Ahmadinejad for his mismanagement of the country and has denounced his crackdown on the press and the internet , the execution of juveniles and especially the violations of women 's rights over the past four years .
Karroubi has also visited music bands in Iran , trying to attract votes from the country 's underground culture , but his campaigning is considered "" inappropriate "" for state - run TV .
Moussavi has not been exempted from the IRIB censorship either .
He objected publicly when he found that state - run TV was going to cut part of his official campaign lecture regarding his memories of Khomeini .
Moussavi is known to have had disagreements with Ayatollah Khamenei , the current supreme leader who was the president under Khomeini , when Moussavi was prime minister .
Moussavi has reportedly said : "" I have been active for the past 20 years since Imam Khomeini died , but why have I been banned from being shown on TV ? ""
IRIB is also criticised for focusing on what it calls Ahmadinejad 's "" achievement "" in the past four years – especially in connection with Iran 's nuclear programme .
IRIB covers Ahmadinejad 's visits to the Iranian provinces in full ( they are governmental tasks rather than campaigning ) , while it does n't show his rivals ' activities .
Ahmadinejad has visited at least four provinces in the past month .
Karroubi and Moussavi have accused Ahmadinejad of using the governmental budget for his presidential campaign , under cover of official duties .
Iranian writers are also joining reformist candidates to denounce Ahmadinejad 's censorship .
Mohammad Shams Langeroudi , a prominent poet and novelist , is among dozens of writers whose novels have been banned from publication recently .
Langeroudi 's new novel Who likes losers ? was banned by the cultural ministry , which vets all books before publication and requires published books to be checked before they can be re - printed .
The Iranian print media watchdog is also putting pressure on newspapers and threatening them with bans – which results in self - censorship .
Last week , an interview I conducted with Noam Chomsky appeared on the front page of the reformist paper Etemaad with a third of it edited out .
Chomsky 's criticisms of Ahmadinejad 's foreign policy , his "" hypocritical "" nuclear programme and his scepticism about the Holocaust were all censored .
Inevitably , Iranian reformist candidates are seeking other ways of distributing information and campaigning .
Emails and SMS are distributed every day over the whole of Iran .
Thousands of Iranians are publishing blogposts about the election despite internet filtering , and millions are watching Farsi programmes from abroad though their illegal satellite dishes to seek the real story of what 's happening in the election ."
2009-06-01,"In recent days Iran has suffered a spate of terrorist attacks : on Thursday a suicide bomber in the city of Zahedan , south - eastern Iran , killed 25 worshippers in a mosque and wounded 120 ; a second bomb was safely defused .
On Friday , three people were wounded as gunmen on motorbikes attacked the Zahedan campaign office of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Yesterday , a bomb was discovered onboard a Tehran - bound flight from Ahvaz in south - western Iran ; it was deactivated after an emergency landing .
While as yet there is no certain connection between the attacks , many within Iran and beyond have been quick to link these to an attempt to destabilise the country in the run - up to the presidential elections – scheduled for 12 June .
Some , including Iran 's Supreme Leader , Ali Khamenei , go further , suggesting the direct involvement of external powers :
"" No one can doubt that the hands of … some interfering powers and their spying services are bloodied by the blood of the innocent . ""
Iranian officials , keen to divert attention away from domestic grievances and the existence of home - grown terrorism , directly accuse external powers : Ali Larijani , Speaker of the Majlis ( Legislative Assembly ) , blames the US for the attacks and threatens that such support for terrorism will "" cost them dearly "" .
Major General Firouzabadi , the armed forces chief of staff , blames Britain and the "" Zionists "" ; others have pointed to the Wahhabis and the Pakistanis .
In the meantime , Jundallah ( the Soldiers of Allah ) , a radical Sunni insurgency group based in Pakistan and within Iran , has claimed responsibility for perpetrating the Thursday bomb attack .
In Tehran , the Pakistani ambassador was served a demarche , and Iran has closed its border with Pakistan .
Pakistan 's Foreign Office spokesman has stressed that Iran and Pakistan are "" brotherly countries "" fighting terrorism together .
President Obama has unequivocally condemned the attacks and a state department spokesman said : "" We do not sponsor any form of terrorism in Iran .
Never have , never will . ""
Back in June 2005 , just five days before the last presidential elections , four bombs exploded across the city of Ahvaz ; soon after , another blew up in Tehran ; and further bombs were discovered and defused .
There have been several other terrorist incidents since 2005 and there were many before .
Attacks have been concentrated in the province of Sistan - Baluchistan , of which Zahedan is the capital , and Ahvaz 's province of Khuzistan .
The huge , arid province of Sistan - Baluchistan , perched on the south - eastern tip of Iran and adjacent to both Pakistan and Afghanistan , is home to a sizeable population of Baluchi speakers , most of whom are Sunnis .
Across its long mountainous and rather porous border pass vast quantities of smuggled narcotics .
Khuzistan , bordering the Iraqi region of Basra , was known until 1936 as Arabistan given the high proportion of Sunni Arabs living there .
The region witnessed some of the most violent fighting during the eight - year Iran - Iraq war , and is Iran 's major oil producing area .
Khuzistani locals feel that little oil wealth passes back into the region ; the residents of Sistan - Baluchistan are frustrated by their region 's poverty and deprivation .
Baluchi and Arab Sunni Muslims , like Iran 's other religious and ethnic minorities , feel aggrieved , discriminated against and marginalised .
The pervasive Iranian nationalist myth is built on the idea of Iranians being Persian - speaking supposedly Aryan Shia .
Not for nothing did Reza Shah , infamous for his sympathy towards Nazism , choose to rebrand Persia as Iran in 1935 , emphasising its Aryan nature ( Iran and Aryan are related words ) ; equally Arabistan was renamed to de - emphasise its Arab nature .
The Iranian nationalist myth ignores the considerable ethnic , linguistic and religious diversity within Iran .
Sunni Muslims , who make up at least 10 % of the population , feel marginalised .
This marginalisation was compounded by the 1979 revolution , despite ( unsuccessful ) efforts to export this revolution as Muslim rather than specifically Shia . Non -
Persian speakers make up nearly half of Iranians even though national educational programmes have long attempted to homogenise the linguistic landscape .
Ethno - linguistic minorities , not least Kurds , Azeri Turks , Baluchis and Arab - Iranians , have all had a tense ambiguous relationship with the central state whether monarchical or republican .
In 1921 , when a coup brought Reza Khan to power , the Iranian state was verging on collapse and was plagued by insurrections : in the north , along the Caspian , an autonomous Soviet Republic challenged Tehran ; across the south , tribal leaders enjoyed independent relations with the British and de facto autonomy .
By 1941 when Reza Shah abdicated , he had built by force a centralised modern state : his was a revolution imposed from above .
Minorities were excluded from the nation but forcibly included in the state .
The Islamic Republic is still faced with deep challenges from its minorities : these include rebels , separatist groups and insurgents such as Jundallah , the Baluchistan People 's party , the Kurdistan Democratic party , and several Ahvaz Arab parties .
Some groups seek greater rights and resources and oppose discrimination ; others want a federalised system or even independence .
Religious and ethnic minorities in Iran and indeed across the region have long attracted the attention of external powers .
Conflicts have seen minorities recruited by opposing sides : during the Iran - Iraq war , Saddam Hussein tried to incite rebellion among the Arabs of Khuzistan while the Islamic Republic recruited Iraqi Shia ; more recently , Iran has sponsored Iraqi Kurdish groups so as to a encourage a managed chaos in Iraq .
Western powers have been widely accused of sowing discord .
Iran , embarrassed by the attacks in Zahedan , has been quick to act .
Less than 36 hours after the mosque bombing , three rebels were executed following a rushed trial .
The judiciary head of Sistan - Baluchistan has been keen to stress that due process was observed but this trial and previous trials of terrorist suspects have been criticised by human rights organisations .
In the case of the Zahedan bombing , statements regarding the trial , the plot itself and even the numbers affected are divergent , even contradictory .
The bombings highlight ongoing ethno - religious tensions within Iran and across the broader region .
Despite the attempts of Iranian officials to deflect attention onto external scapegoats it is clear that there are serious domestic problems : the country 's integrity is not yet in real danger but the Islamic regime and Iranian society at large must seek a more equitable accommodation for its diverse population ."
2009-06-04,
2009-06-04,"Iran 's president has traded personal attacks and accusations with his main election rival last night in a bitterly contested televised debate seen as key to deciding the country 's forthcoming presidential election .
In an extraordinarily barbed 90-minute live encounter , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , launched a furious barrage against his critics , in an all - out effort to rescue a race that appeared to be turning against him .
He repeatedly tried to tie Mir Hossein Mousavi , a former prime minister and the leading reformist contender , to two past presidents , Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami , whose governments Ahmadinejad claimed were corrupt .
Mousavi even had to defend the academic record of his wife , Zahra Rahnavard , after the president claimed she held two illegal degrees .
Rahnavard , a distinguished academic , has been campaigning alongside her husband , in a break with Iran 's male - dominated political convention .
Struggling to keep his temper , Mousavi described his wife as one of Iran 's leading intellectuals and Qur'anic researchers , and accused Ahmadinejad of demeaning the presidency . ""
It is below the dignity of the head of the government to mention names of people without giving them the chance to defend themselves , "" he told the president . ""
Mr Rafsanjani and Mr Khatami have been presidents of this country .
You are tarnishing them in front of 50 million people , while they can not defend themselves .
"" The debate was the second in a series of six being aired by Iran 's state broadcaster IRIB before the 12 June election , in which Ahmadinejad is seeking a second term .
But in contrast to a lacklustre affair on Tuesday involving the two other candidates , Mehdi Karroubi and Mohsen Rezai , last night 's event crackled with antagonism .
Ahmadinejad , who turned up with two thick files , had warned in advance that he intended to name those he accused of corruption .
He singled out Rafsanjani 's sons and several other officials he claimed supported Mousavi .
Mousavi in turn accused Ahmadinejad of "" self - centredness "" and of policies based on "" delusion and superstition "" .
He said he had decided to stand against him after 20 years away from politics because he was worried that the country faced "" great danger "" as a result of the Ahmadinejad 's foreign and economic policies .
At one point , the two clashed over the detention two years ago of 15 British military personnel after being accused of entering Iran 's territorial waters before being released , amid great fanfare , by Ahmadinejad .
Mousavi said the sight of the sailors dressed in suits being bid farewell by the president had hurt Iran 's image .
But Ahmadinejad insisted it had debunked western depictions of Iranians as hostage - takers , and claimed that Tony Blair , the then prime minister , had sent him a written apology .
Mousavi criticised Ahmadinejad 's repeated questioning of the Holocaust .
But the president , who earlier in the day had described the Holocaust as a "" great deception "" , replied : "" Why not raise the issue of the Holocaust .
Why should we fear Europeans coming here and talking about human rights in our country . ""
The debate took place amid indications that Ahmadinejad is trailing Mousavi in the opinion polls .
One survey last week showed Mousavi ahead by 38 % to 34 % in the country 's 10 largest cities .
However , Iranian polls are notoriously unreliable ."
2009-06-04,"Last night millions of Iranians watched an unprecedented television event : a live debate between the two main presidential contenders , Mir Hussein Mousavi and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Later , thousands of youths with cars and motorcycles cruised the streets around Tehran 's state - run TV complex with green banners praising Mousavi 's stand during his 90-minute duel against the hardline president .
Riot police appeared on streets to crack down on Mousavi 's supporters .
Today , thousands of Iranian bloggers updated their online pages with appreciation for Mousavi and "" victory of sobriety over falsehood "" headlines .
Seyed Reza Shokrollahi , a pro - Mousavi blogger , posted a short comment last night a few minutes after the TV debate that reads "" finally after four years , Ahmadinejad was forced to obey the law and get quiet "" – a reference to Mousavi telling the president to stop interrupting .
Maryam Mohtadi , an Iranian female journalist who blogs at Page-13.com , praised Mousavi for his harsh criticism of Ahmadinejad 's clampdowns on the press and book publishing in her latest blog post .
"" I 'm proud of you for pointing a finger at Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in front of the whole of Iran and saying that you are here to change this situation , "" she wrote .
"" I 'm proud of you and I will stand up and work for your victory till the election time . ""
For the past four years , Ahmadinejad has boasted of inviting the US , Barack Obama and the west to debate with him on a live TV programmes – a challenge that he claims they dare not accept .
But in his first domestic TV debate he was defeated by Mousavi , a former prime minister who is regarded as his main rival in the coming election on 12 June .
Backed by the moderate ex - president , Mohammad Khatami , Mousavi is attracting more and more votes from Iran 's huge young and female population .
Mousavi brings his wife , Zahra Rahnavard , to his campaign rallies and walks hand in hand with her – behaviour that is not accepted by hardline religious people in Iran .
Rahnavard shows her open - mindedness by wearing colourful headscarves instead of the regular black ones .
These days , Mousavi 's hand - in - hand photos with Rahnavard are distributed every day in emails saying he will respect women rights in the country .
On the debate last night , Ahmadinejad made a personal attack on Mousavi 's wife , claiming she had "" received her PhD without attending university exams "" .
Mousavi angrily replied that his wife "" is a prominent intellectual who worked for 10 years to get her PhD "" .
Then , pointing a finger at Ahmadinejad , he said : "" I am coming to change the situation ... to change this mentality , so that nobody suffers from public accusation .
You are endangering the country .
""
A fake PhD degree from Oxford University held by Ahmadinejad 's interior minister became a public scandal in Iran last year .
Ahmadinejad could n't follow his usual strategy of asking questions instead of answering them when Mousavi accused him of "" undermining the dignity of our nation "" during his four - year presidency and criticised him mainly over his foreign policy .
"" It has inflicted heavy damage on us and created tension with other countries .
It has left us with not a single friend in the region , "" Mousavi said .
Mousavi , who steered Iran 's economy during the eight - year war with Iraq , looked at Ahmadinejad and charged that his foreign policy suffered from "" adventurism , instability , exhibitionism and extremism "" and accused him of "" telling lies to people and daydreaming "" .
Referring to Ahmadinejad 's visits to Iraq and Italy , Mousavi said : "" Why are you daydreaming ?
On what basis did you spread the rumours that they wanted to kidnap you in Iraq and Italy ? ""
From the other side , Ahmadinejad accused Mousavi of "" underestimating "" his so - called achievements on nuclear and defence issues in Iran and blamed him for ignoring them .
Ahmadinejad also tried to tie Mousavi with former presidents Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami , calling both of them "" corrupted "" .
Today , Rafsanjani wrote a letter to a state - run TV director and asked for a live debate with Ahmadinejad to respond to the accusations about him and his family .
Accused by Ahmadinejad of calling him "" the dictator "" , Mousavi replied that Ahmadinejad 's "" evasion of laws "" would lead to dictatorship .
Last night 's TV debate is estimated to have had 50 million viewers inside and outside Iran .
It is widely believed that the debate , with Mousavi 's criticism of Ahmadinejad 's mismanagement , his crackdowns on university student activities and his scepticism about the Holocaust , will bring the reformist candidate within sight of victory ."
2009-06-04,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , faced a rare backlash from some of the country 's most powerful officials today after a furious television debate in which he labelled many of his critics corrupt .
In the most significant development , Ahmadinejad appeared to have irked the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , over his performance in Wednesday night 's debate with Mir Hossein Mousavi , his main opponent in next week 's presidential election .
"" One does n't like to see a nominee , for the sake of proving himself , seeking to negate somebody else , "" Khamenei said in a speech commemorating the 20th anniversary of the death of the Iranian revolution 's spiritual leader , Ayatollah Khomeini .
"" I have no problem with debate , dialogue and criticism but these debates must take place within a religious framework . ""
Khamenei has previously given Ahmadinejad his public backing and his support is considered essential if the president is to win a second term .
Ahmadinejad may have been relieved to note that the supreme leader also found fault with his rival 's rhetoric , particularly a segment where Mousavi criticised the incumbent for his "" extremist "" foreign policy .
"" I do not accept the sayings of those who imagine that our nation has become belittled in the world because of its commitment to its principles , "" Khamenei said , adding "" this path will continue until final victory "" .
Ahmadinejad 's accusations of corruption prompted a string of senior figures – including former president Hashemi Rafsanjani – to demand a right of reply .
Apparently trailing in the opinion polls , Ahmadinejad attempted to link Mousavi – the main reformist candidate – to the past governments of Rafsanjani and the reformist ex - president Mohammad Khatam , which he said had been guilty of widespread graft .
Among others , he singled out Rafsanjani 's sons as well as Ali Akbar Nateq - Nouri , the current head of the supreme leader 's inspectorate .
Khamenei 's criticisms echoed those of Mousavi , who told Ahmadinejad during the debate : "" This is a sin .
We are Muslims , we believe in God .
We can not name people like that and accuse them . ""
The most remarkable part of an acerbic encounter came when Ahmadinejad held up a file apparently referring to Mousavi 's wife , Zahra Rahnavard , and questioned her qualifications . ""
Can I speak about the education background of a lady with you –
shall I
, "" Ahmadinejad said in a goading tone .
He accused Rahnavard , who has been campaigning with her husband , of gaining two degrees illegally and starting a PhD without sitting an entrance exam .
He also said she had become a university lecturer and chancellor without the necessary qualifications .
Mousavi , taken aback , replied by telling viewers that they should vote for him "" if you want to change this atmosphere of so easily accusing other people "" .
After the debate , pro - Mousavi students took to the streets of Tehran chanting : "" Ahmadinejad , impolite person , shame on you .
Leave this country alone . ""
One Mousavi supporter was reported to have died in clashes with Ahmadinejad 's followers in the eastern city of Mashhad .
Tensions have been rising ahead of the election .
A bombing in a mosque last week killed 25 people in the south - west and another bout of unrest left five more dead on Monday .
Khamenei has rebuked the west for meddling in Iranian affairs , and yesterday said that foreigners were trying to undermine Iran ahead of the vote , by insinuating that results would be falsified and the vote would not be competitive . ""
During the past two or three months , foreign radio programmes have been tarnishing the elections , making people pessimistic , "" he said , accusing foreign media of "" confiscating the hope of the Iranian people . """
2009-06-06,"As Iranians prepare for the country 's increasingly unpredictable presidential election , a national football disappointment yesterday provided a paradoxical boost for those hoping to unseat the incumbent hardliner , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
President Ahmadinejad faces a serious challenge from Mir Hossein Musavi , who is reviving the hopes of the long - demoralised reformist camp .
Musavi , a former prime minister , benefited when Iran drew 0 - 0 against North Korea - reinforcing worries that the beautiful game has declined along with the Islamic Republic 's economic situation and international standing during Ahmadinejad 's stormy four - year term .
For many football - crazy Iranians , especially the young people who form the majority of the population , the "" axis of evil "" fixture in Pyongyang , which all but ended Iran 's 2010 World Cup hopes , reinforced the sense that it is time for change .
During the presidency of Ahmadinejad 's liberal predecessor , Mohamed Khatami , Iran twice won the Asian Games and qualified for the 1998 World Cup . ""
For the last four years our national team has kept being beaten , "" said a disappointed Mostafa Hasani , a photographer and Musavi supporter .
"" Under Khatami we did really well .
But when there is no trust in politics footballers do n't play with trust either .
If Musavi becomes president , Iranian soccer will improve along with everything else . ""
Hours after the match , Iranians were tuning in last night to another dramatic 90-minute face - off , the latest in a series of US - style TV debates .
This one pitted Ahmadinejad against Mehdi Karrubi , a cleric who is explicitly reformist but has little chance of winning .
Musavi , crucially , has the backing of Khatami , who vacillated for weeks before declaring his own candidacy and then quickly withdrawing in March .
Fifteen million people watched last week as Ahmadinejad and Musavi - a white - haired , professorial - looking 67-year - old - clashed furiously over the president 's economic and foreign policy record .
It became personal when Ahmadinejad attacked Musavi 's wife - a high - profile presence on his campaign - for obtaining her doctorate under false pretences and accused other opponents of being corrupt .
Musavi blamed Ahmadinejad for a litany of mistakes including "" adventurism , instability , play - acting , exaggeration , self - importance and superficiality "" .
Yet the nuclear issue , which has triggered sanctions against Iran and so preoccupies the west , barely got a mention .
The tone was so sharp that it drew a stern rebuke from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's "" supreme leader "" , who is assumed to be backing Ahmadinejad again - and who will make all the key decisions , whoever becomes president .
"" These debates have changed everything , "" said Saeed Kamali Dehghan , a commentator and journalist .
"" People saw 90 minutes of criticism of the government on state television .
That 's unprecedented .
"" Tension is palpable in the run - up to Friday 's vote .
Fist - fights have broken out between the rival camps and there are nightly car rallies in big cities .
On Friday - always a time for letting off steam - Tehran 's main north - south route , Valiasar Avenue , was gridlocked until after midnight by honking cars as young men on mopeds roared up and down the pavements waving election posters and screaming slogans .
"" Ahmadi , bye bye "" is a favourite that works well in Persian and English .
Taxi drivers are rumoured to have been paid $ 50 to stick pictures of the president on their vehicles .
But many have green opposition ribbons fluttering from their radio aerials .
With a short campaign , a volatile mood and unreliable polls , most analysts agree only that there is evidence of a swing towards Musavi , at least in Tehran , and expect Ahmadinejad to win in the countryside and small towns .
Turnout is the key : it is said that Ahmadinejad can count on 13 million votes from those who back him or fellow hardliner Mohsen Rezaei .
In 2005 he was helped by massive abstention rates .
But any turnout higher than 30 million would move the polls decisively towards Musavi and Karrubi .
If no candidate receives 50 % of the vote in the first round , there will be a run - off a week later .
Jaafar Golbaz , a leading light of the Musavi campaign , is optimistic .
"" I think Musavi has a good chance of winning , most likely in the second round , "" he said .
"" State TV is playing a really important role this time .
People are divided into three camps : those who are with us , those who are against us , and those who are hesitating .
The TV is very significant for the hesitant . ""
"" This is a very hot race , "" said Mehdi , a thirtysomething Tehran office worker .
"" But I still think Ahmadinejad will win outright in the first round of voting .
And I hope he will .
Why not ? """
2009-06-07,"The wife of the leading opposition candidate in this week 's Iranian presidential election today threatened to sue Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for lying about her .
Zahra Rahnavard , who is married to the moderate frontrunner Mir Hossein Mousavi , also told reporters who pressed her about comparisons with the US first lady : "" I am not Iran 's Michelle Obama .
I am Zahra , the follower of Fatimeh Zahra ( the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad ) .
I respect all women who are active . ""
Rahnavard , a 61-year - old political scientist , sculptor and grandmother , wears a full - length black chador , though her headscarf does have an eye - catching , brightly - coloured floral pattern that conservatives might disapprove of as "" bad hijab "" .
"" I have liberal values on many things , but I can not decide about the hijab because it is based on the Qur'an , "" she said at a packed press conference at her husband 's campaign headquarters in central Tehran . ""
But it should n't limit what women can do .
"" The Michelle Obama parallel has added spice to Iran 's unpredictable presidential race , especially after the hardline Ahmadinejad scornfully questioned Rahnavard 's educational qualifications in the first of a series of debates last week .
Fist fights broke out in Tehran between Ahmadinejad supporters and opponents after another heated election debate on Saturday night , before Friday 's ballot .
"" I felt sorry for the president when he questioned my academic credentials because it was against the law and it was a lie , "" Rahnavard said .
"" It shows his weakness .
He does n't have anything else to tell people .
He has to apologise to the Iranian nation , to me and my husband for violating the privacy of our marriage .
"" Interest in Rahnavard has helped to propel her husband into the limelight , both at home and abroad .
The former university chancellor is often seen walking hand in hand with him .
The fact that she is seen as an asset is causing a mild stir and boosting hopes of change in Friday 's election . ""
Zahra is a bit tough and not very womanly and she does get angry easily , "" said one young woman campaign volunteer . ""
But Mousavi is very calm , so she complements him very well . ""
Rahnavard takes care to express her views with reference to Islamic values .
Asked about her attitude to the religious police patrols that check on couples and order women to cover up , she said : "" We will do anything we can to ensure that the police do n't interfere in people 's private lives .
The Qur'an says that.""Iran has not had a female cabinet minister since the 1979 revolution .
And although the Iranian constitution does not forbid women from becoming president , no female has ever been approved as a candidate ."
2009-06-08,"Iran 's election contest intensified today as Mir Hossein Mousavi , the moderate candidate challenging the hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for the presidency , mounted a massive show of strength in Tehran , raising the stakes in advance of Friday 's landmark poll .
Mousavi voters formed a human chain they claimed ran the entire 15-mile length of Valiasr Avenue , the capital 's main north - south road , the impressive turnout underscoring the formidable challenge that Mousavi represents .
The Ahmadinejad camp mounted its own rally , bussing in thousands of supporters to the city 's enormous open - air prayer ground in a carnival - type atmosphere .
The crowd was so vast and security arrangements so chaotic that in the end his bodyguards prevented him from speaking .
Traffic across the city was gridlocked and clashes were reported between supporters of the two sides last night .
Mousavi , 67 , who was Iran 's prime minister during the 1980s , has a reputation for being incorrupt .
He has surprised analysts by emerging as a serious challenger to Ahmadinejad and is thought likely to coast to victory in Tehran , while the incumbent is strong in the countryside and small towns .
It was impossible to accurately estimate the size of today 's Mousavi rally , which was raucous but good - humoured and peaceful .
Some claimed it was the biggest demonstration in Tehran for a decade – notwithstanding the massive turnout for Ahmadinejad just across the city .
Others went further .
"" It 's like what happened before the revolution in 1979 , "" said Ali Safari , 35 , a businessman who sported the green wristband that is the Mousavi campaign signature .
"" Everything is focused on one point , and that 's to get real change . ""
The contrast between the camps could not have been starker .
Mousavi supporters are predominantly young and urbane .
Many of the young women in the chain would be accused by conservatives of wearing "" bad hijab "" – meaning their compulsory head covering is only loosely attached . ""
Ahmadinejad has done nothing good for our country , "" said Neda Ahmadi , 24 , wearing blue eye make - up and a tight - fitting jacket and jeans beneath her hijab .
"" Musawi can improve Iran 's relations with other countries and focus on our own people 's needs . ""
But Lida , another 24-year - old woman , who was at the president 's rally , called him "" a truthful man who leads a simple life "" .
Iran she said , "" has not been isolated but is showing itself as it wants other countries to see it "" .
Ahmadinejad 's supporters were showered with free flags , posters and stickers , and bottled water to cope with the extreme heat .
Many images portrayed him with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader , who stands at the apex of the Islamic republic 's complex system of government .
In the Mousavi human chain , supporters brandished anti - Ahmadinejad placards proclaiming "" lies are forbidden "" and chanted "" Ahmadi , bye - bye . ""
Young men and women linked themselves together with green ribbon – daring behaviour in Iran .
Honking cars , bikes and even skateboards formed part of the event , which went on well after nightfall .
"" It 's very exciting to see but not clear that it provides a firm guide to who will actually win on the day , "" said one diplomat .
"" But at the very least it would seem to guarantee a high turnout . ""
Experts agree the higher the turnout the greater the chance that Mousavi will unseat Ahmadinejad , possibly in a second round run - off .
Iran 's interior ministry said it was hoping for a record turnout among the country 's 46 million voters .
But there was no response to a report that ministry employees were instructed to rig the election results on the basis of a fatwa – religious edict – from a pro - Ahmadinejad ayatollah .
According to the Tehran Bureau website , the unnamed cleric is said to have stated : "" If someone is elected president and hurts the Islamic values that have been spread [ by Ahmadinejad ] to Lebanon , Palestine , Venezuela and other places , it is against Islam to vote for that person .
We should not vote for that person , and also warn people about that person .
It is your religious duty as the supervisors of the elections to do so . ""
Candidates
If no candidate gets 50 % on Friday , a run - off will be staged a week later
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Conservative incumbent elected with big majority in 2005 .
Popular in rural Iran , but less so in the cities .
Mir Hussein Mousavi Great reformist hope .
Popular among younger voters and city - dwellers .
Mohsen Rezaei Hardline former commander of the revolutionary guard .
Could split the conservative vote .
Mehdi Karroubi Reformist former speaker of the Iranian parliament .
Little chance of making an impact .
He was a candidate in 2004 , but fell out of the race after the first round"
2009-06-09,"Iran 's turbulent election campaign took a dramatic turn last night when a powerful politician accused president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of lying and demanded he be punished .
Former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani publicly urged Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , to rein in Ahmadinejad - a potentially damaging blow to the incumbent ahead of Friday 's poll .
Rafsanjani 's call came as supporters of the president 's most serious rival , Mir - Hossein Mousavi , staged a second day and night of mass action in Tehran .
Last week millions watched an electrifying TV debate in which Ahmadinejad sought to link Mousavi to both Rafsanjani and the former reformist president , Mohammad Khatami , who Ahmadinejad labelled as corrupt .
In an open letter , Rafsanjani wrote that Iranians had witnessed "" misstatements and fabrications "" during these unprecedented exchanges .
"" I am expecting you to resolve this position in order to extinguish the fire , whose smoke can be seen in the atmosphere , and to foil dangerous plots to take action , "" said Rafsanjani .
He had earlier complained of "" smear tactics "" tainting the election .
Khamenei implicitly backs Ahmadinejad , but last week also rebuked him for his remarks in the debate , so his position is crucial .
As successor to Ayatollah Khomeini , he stands at the apex of Iran 's political system , and is considered to be above politics , commanding the army and having the final say on big issues .
Analysts interpreted Rafsanjani 's letter as a rebuke for Khamenei 's continuing support of Ahmadinejad .
His comments were echoed by 14 high clerics from the Shia holy city of Qom , who expressed "" deep concern and regret "" that Iran 's image had been harmed in the debate .
Meanwhile , Tehran saw chaotic scenes for a second day when Mousavi supporters , many of them young women , flocked in their tens of thousands to a rally , waving the green ribbons , banners and posters that have become the symbol of his campaign .
A "" human chain "" rally on Monday night was likened by many to the build - up to the 1979 revolution .
Previous Mousavi rallies had to be cancelled because permission was suddenly withdrawn by the authorities .
On Sunday a rally at Karaj outside Tehran could not be held because the electricity to the public address system mysteriously failed .
On Monday night , in the last of six televised debates , Ahmadinejad clashed over the economy with the only other conservative candidate , the former revolutionary guard commander , Mohsen Rezaei .
Ahmadinejad claimed that he had slashed inflation to 15 % , but Rezaei , an economist , said the true figure was 25 % .
A fourth candidate , reformist cleric Mehdi Karoubi , dismissed as "" psychological warfare "" rumours that he might withdraw to boost Mousavi 's chances ."
2009-06-09,"Colourful cartoons have emerged of the four candidates in Iran 's stormy presidential elections on Friday .
The cartoons by an anonymous artist are going "" viral "" in the Iranian blogosphere and via email , and poke fun at the hardline incumbent , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Ahmadinejad 's colour is brown .
And just in case anyone does n't get it , the caricature shows the president about to enter a toilet .
He has been the butt of many jokes since he came to power four turbulent years ago .
But they are getting nastier , with mudslinging and character assassination routine as polling day approaches .
The levels of excitement and mobilisation have even been compared to the epoch - making years before the 1979 revolution .
Mir Hossein Mousavi
The moderate most likely to beat Ahmadinejad , Mousavi has branded himself successfully as the green candidate – though the colour was chosen not for a commitment to environmental issues but for its Islamic resonance and as a symbol of progress .
Mehdi Karroubi
The reformist cleric 's black represents the oil money he has promised to spend on ordinary people if he is elected – subtext : unlikely .
Mohsen Rezai
The other conservative candidate , and a former Revolutionary Guards commander , Rezai is officially colourless , his campaign largely digital .
But these images by an anonymous Iranian artist suggest other possibilities .
Rezai is portrayed in red to mark his military past – subtext : blood on his hands ."
2009-06-10,"If Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is worried about losing his job on Friday he is not showing it .
Support may be growing for the moderate Mir Hossein Mousavi , his main rival for the Iranian presidency , but the hardliner is sticking to his guns .
On the eve of what looks like the country 's most significant election in a decade , Ahmadinejad was in classic attack mode yesterday , using his final campaign rally to lambast Zionism and imperialists and accuse the three other candidates of using "" Hitler 's methods , to repeat lies and accusations until ­everyone believes them "" .
In a strange piece of political repetition , Ahmadinejad 's slogan , courtesy of Barack Obama , is ""
Yes We Can "" .
Even opponents admit it would be rash to assume he can not win four more years .
His common touch and defiance of the US and Israel go down well in the countryside and small towns , and with many poor and traditional people everywhere .
"" The president is a good man and fears no one , "" said Mariam Azarmi , a computer expert , as her little boy clung to her black chador while they awaited the start of another noisy rally .
"" He has made us proud in the world . ""
Reza Mansouri lives in south Tehran , stronghold of the Basij militia and home to many mullahs . ""
Ahmadinejad is good for the poor .
He 's the best of the lot .
Mousavi is only good for the rich , "" said the 53-year - old driver .
But elsewhere in this vast capital , the president is loathed for his mishandling of the economy , squandering billions in oil revenue and depleting the reserves with populist gestures .
Unemployment of 17 % is a ­disaster , especially for the young .
Inflation – officially 24 % , though Ahmadinejad claimed in one TV debate
it was 14 % – has taken a heavy toll .
Other charges include domestic repression , the extensive use of the death penalty and discrimination against women , as well as the grave damage done to Iran by his generally confrontational style and remarks on the Holocaust .
Many object too to the support he has given Hezbollah and the Palestinians .
"" We sympathise , but let the Arabs pay , "" is a common refrain . ""
We need the money here in Iran . ""
In Tehran 's leafy northern suburbs the gleeful chant "" Ahmadi bye bye "" has been taken up by thousands of Mousavi fans , many of them young women sporting headbands , face - paint and flags in green – the colour of hope and Islam . ""
Go open a grocery , "" taunts a slogan ridiculing the president 's recent distribution of 400,000 tonnes of free potatoes .
Mousavi 's is an impressively modern campaign that makes highly effective use of email , SMS and Facebook , but it is also rooted in Iran 's national culture : the candidate 's name , in beautifully intricate Persian calligraphy , is everywhere .
He promises "" a state of hope "" .
Though a lacklustre orator , Mousavi is remembered as an effective and incorrupt prime minister during the 1980s .
He has pledged to increase personal freedoms and present "" a happier face to the world "" .
What that would mean for the nuclear issue , the focus of western interest in Iran , is unclear .
But he is no radical .
If he had been , he would not have been allowed to stand .
Supporters talk of their mounting excitement and some even whisper of victory , if not on Friday – when the ­winner needs more than 50 % of the vote , then in a runoff on 19 June .
The atmosphere is electric as Tehran lets its hair down for nightly rallies when cars and bikes roar up and down and young men and women mix freely .
The morality police , who usually monitor "" bad hijab "" or tight jeans , have eased up for the duration of the campaign .
Excitement on this scale has not been seen since Iran beat the US in the 1998 World Cup or when the reformist Mohammad Khatami – now backing Mousavi – swept to power in 1997 .
It may not be another revolution , but it matters .
"" Even if this is just kids having fun and making the streets their own for a few nights , it 's a process of political mobilisation , "" said the mother of a teenage boy .
"" After all this , how are you going to bottle up his sense of choice ? ""
Hopes of change do not seem to be wildly exaggerated .
"" We are not expecting too much too quickly , but just a start , "" said a green - draped Babha Akbari , 24 .
Student Setareh Assadollahzadeh , 19 , said : "" I want Mousavi to win for so many reasons .
Ahmadinejad has been such a nightmare for everything . ""
The key development of this election is the apparent end to the apathy which allowed the latter to win in 2005 – 20 million voters abstained .
That led the reformist writer Mohammed Atrianfar to scorn a people that "" does not think a vote is worth the price of a chelo kebab "" .
Iranians may have had good reasons not to vote .
"" I do n't want to give legitimation to an undemocratic system , "" said Arian Alimohammadi , an engineering graduate .
"" We do n't need a president as long as we have a supreme leader .
He decides everything . ""
Hossein Frutan , a history teacher , felt the same until this week but now plans to vote for Mousavi , recognising that , though the Islamic regime may not change , things can only get better if he wins .
"" Mousavi will be able to make a difference just as Khatemi did .
Before Khatemi no newspaper dared to criticise the government .
If Mousavi wins the world will have a better image of Iran after the damage done by Ahmadinejad .
The priority is to get rid of him . ""
Saeed Leylaz , a well - known Iranian commentator , was quoted yesterday as saying he believed that 50 % of Iranians now backed Mousavi .
If that is true , change is coming to Iran .
Yet if expectations are high there are also fears that the regime may try to fix the result .
Ominously , a senior Revolutionary Guards official warned against anyone trying to launch a ­""velvet revolution "" ."
2009-06-12,"Iranians go to the polls today to elect a president after an acrimonious and volatile election campaign that has polarised the country and unleashed mass opposition to the hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
In the absence of reliable independent opinion polls , experts predicted yesterday that Mir Hossein Mousavi , the moderate "" green "" candidate , would probably beat the controversial incumbent so long as the result was not rigged .
Saeed Lalyaz , a respected political commentator , said he believed Mousavi now commanded the support of 55 - 60 % across the country and warned of a possible crackdown on the opposition if Ahmadinejad were re - elected .
"" I worry about the impact of any announcement that Ahmadinejad wins in the first round , "" said Lalyaz .
"" Whoever wins , these people on the streets will not go home easily .
If Ahmadinejad is president for a second time I worry about another Tiananmen Square experience . ""
Ominously , as three weeks of often passionate campaigning drew to a close , the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRG ) warned that any attempt at a popular "" revolution "" would be crushed .
Underlining the unprecedented scale of public interest in the election , it was reported that more than 10 m text messages had been sent on Tuesday alone , apparently reflecting intense efforts to get the vote out and avoid the risk of mass abstentions .
The regime is also encouraging mass participation .
"" The people of Iran will choose someone who will resist the bullying of those who are arrogant and defend Iran 's interest in the world , "" said a statement from the Basij militia .
The candidate who takes more than 50 % becomes president automatically .
If none does tomorrow , a second run - off round will be held next Friday .
Two other candidates , reformist cleric Mehdi Karoubi and Mohsen Rezaei , another conservative , would drop out if that happened .
Ahmadinejad was reportedly losing support to Rezaei , a former IRG commander , and elements of the military were said to be backing Mousavi , who has pledged to increase personal freedoms .
A victory for the former prime minister could improve relations with the west , though big policy changes are unlikely ."
2009-06-12,"Iranians have gone to the polls in large numbers today for a crucial presidential election that has polarised the country and unleashed mass opposition to the hardline incumbent , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
While there have been no official turnout figures , polling was extended for two hours , with voters at one polling station at a school in a wealthy suburb of north Tehran queueing around the block despite the blazing early afternoon sun – a scene repeated throughout the country .
Ominously , as three weeks of often passionate campaigning drew to a close , the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRG ) warned that any attempt at a popular "" revolution "" would be crushed .
In the holy city of Qom , a centre of Shia scholarship , hundreds of clerics and women dressed in long black robes waited to vote in a long line outside a mosque .
One election official was quoted as predicting up to 80 % of the country 's 46 million voters could cast ballots .
A high turnout would be expected to favour Mir Hossein Mousavi , the former prime minister and moderate "" green "" candidate who is particularly popular with younger voters .
In the absence of reliable independent opinion polls , experts have predicted that Mousavi will probably beat Ahmadinejad as long as the result is not rigged .
"" I hope to defeat Ahmadinejad today , "" said Mahnaz Mottaghi , 23 , after casting her ballot at a mosque in central Tehran .
While the month - long campaign has been hard fought , even acrimonious , outside groups have complained that Ahmadinejad has enjoyed far more access to state TV and radio than Mousavi .
Saeed Lalyaz , a respected political commentator , said yesterday he believed Mousavi commanded the support of 55%-60 % across the country and warned of a possible crackdown on the opposition if Ahmadinejad were re - elected .
"" I worry about the impact of any announcement that Ahmadinejad wins in the first round , "" said Lalyaz .
"" Whoever wins , these people on the streets will not go home easily .
If Ahmadinejad is president for a second time I worry about another Tiananmen Square experience . ""
After casting his vote , the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , urged Iranians to remain calm . ""
As far as I see and hear , passion and motivation is very high among people , "" Khamenei told reporters .
"" If some intend to create tension , this will harm people . ""
Ahmadinejad commented on the high turnout after voting at a mosque in eastern Tehran . ""
A strong and revolutionary decision by the people will mean a bright and progressive future for the nation , "" he told the IRNA news agency .
Mousavi voted with his wife at a mosque in Tehran 's southern outskirts .
Underlining the unprecedented scale of public interest in the election , it was reported that more than 10 m text messages were sent on Tuesday alone , apparently reflecting intense efforts to get the vote out and avoid the risk of mass abstentions .

2009-06-12,"There may be four candidates in today 's Iranian presidential poll but it 's really all about the leading reformist incumbent , Mir Hussein Mousavi , and his hardline rival Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , with little obvious support for either Mehdi Karoubi or Mohsen Rezaee .
Waiting in long queues in front of their mosques and schools to cast their ballots from early in the morning , millions of Iranians decided to come out to vote in the most tense election since 1979 .
Mohammad Farahani , a 22 year - old university student , arrived at 9 am and queued for nearly half an hour at Tehran 's Alrasoul mosque to vote for his favoured candidate , Mousavi .
"" I did n't see such a huge amount of people voting in the first hours last time , "" he says , sporting a green wristband to show his support .
There has , however , been widespread concern among Mousavi 's supporters .
Mostafa Hasani , a young Iranian artist who is leading Mousavi 's green campaign , told the Guardian that there had been reports of vote - rigging this morning .
Texts and emails distributed rapidly in Iran have formed an alternative campaigning strategy in this election – mostly in favour of Mousavi .
The country 's text message network has been totally blocked since the polls opened .
Today 's most important mesasage encourages Mousavi 's supporters to write their ballots in pen and with their full names – and not to cast them in mosques but in schools .
Mousavi supporters believe that there is a risk of vote rigging in mosques where the monitors are mostly Basijis who control religious places .
Mohsen Safayi , 32 , explains that he 's been trying to send a text message to his friend for the past 30 minutes . ""
SMS has played an important role this time in the election , mostly among Mousavi and Karroubi 's supporters who did n't have many choices for campaigning in the country , "" he says .
Emails sent around today recommend Mousavi supporters do n't carry any green banners , to reduce the possibility of being harassed .
They also warn that there will be a false rumour spread by Ahmadinejad 's supporters that Mousavi has withdrawn .
Mohsen Rezaee 's website , rezaee.org , appeared to have been blocked as well .
Mousavi 's campaign website , ghalamnews.ir , reports that there 's a possibility that the government will block Mousavi supporters ' blogs and websites today .
The website also carries reports that Mousavi 's representatives have not been allowed to monitor polls at some centres in the country and have been poorly treated .
Reformist candidate Mousavi cast his vote alongside his wife , Zahra Rahnavard , in the central mosque of Ray city in southern Tehran .
After voting he stepped out to speak to reporters but found the electricity had been cut off , leaving him without a microphone .
This has happened to him more than once at public rallies throughout the campaign , leading to accusations that the government is trying to silence him .
This time , Mousavi angrily objected to his treatment , and continued to talk to reporters without a microphone .
The former Iranian moderate president Mohammad Khatami who cast his ballot this morning in Tehran Jamaran 's religious complex told reporters : "" I 'm not a fortune teller but as far as I 'm seeing Mousavi should win . ""
More than 4 million votes were cast by midday , according to Iran 's interior minister , Sadeq Mahsouli .
He also told Iran 's state - run TV that there are not enough polling centres due to the high turnout – and that voting might extend until midnight .
There is also a lot of concern among Mousavi supporters about the polling centres in Iran 's embassy in the United Arab Emirates ( home to half a million Iranians ) , where there are no reformist representatives to monitor voting .
The interior ministry had also increased the numbers of mobile voting booths – which collect votes from small villages , hospitals and other hard - to - reach places – to 14,000 , 10 times more than in the last elections .
Many analysts fear the lack of monitoring of mobile polls might also lead to widespread vote - rigging .
Pejman Semnani , an 20-year - old Iranian university student I met in a Tehran polling booth , expressed his fears about mobile polls : "" Mobile polls are able to change the results , everybody is concerned about the increase in the number of mobile polls , which reformist newspapers say is neither reasonable nor necessary .
"" Progressive Iranians have been worried that Karroubi 's presence in the election might affect the reformists ' chances of victory but today many analysts are arguing that it might actually help him by attracting Ahmadinejad 's votes .
Kambiz Moradi , a 47-year - old schoolteacher believes that Karroubi 's presence in the election might also attract voters who did n't participate in the last election .
Mehdi Tavasol , a 27-year - old pro - Karroubi voter says : "" I 'm pretty sure that Karroubi will not win but the important thing is that any vote for Karroubi and Rezaie will help also Mousavi , because it would drag Ahmadinejad 's votes under 50 % and would increase the possibility of having a second round of voting . ""
"" Rezaie is also a hardliner and fundamentalist but he is not as popular as Ahmadinejad , so his presence in the election would help Mousavi by attracting Ahmadinejad 's votes ‚ "" he explains .
Mousavi 's campaign website says he will win in at least 21 out of 30 provinces .
By contrast , Rajanews.com , a news website affiliated to Ahmadinejad 's supporters , says their opinion polls suggest he will gain 61.5 % of the total ballot by the end of the day .
Supporting Mousavi started just a week ago when Iran state - run TV conducted an extremely exciting debate between him and Ahmadinejad in Iran 's most unprecedented challenging television program since the Islamic Republic where Mousavi criticised the Iranian president harshly and called him literally a liar .
If there was a time when criticising president of the country or head of the experts ' council was taboo in Iran , it seems to be over : last week millions of Iranians chanted "" Down with Ahmadinejad "" , "" Ahmadinejad , the great liar "" , "" Down with dictator "" , "" Ahmadi bye - bye "" , "" Down with Hashemi "" and "" By the end of the week , Ahmadi is gone "" in streets all over the country , even in the very rural regions .
For the first night after the debate , thousands of cars went out to cruise streets in Tehran to support Mousavi and showed their excitement , but over the next few days it became a public enthusiasm which one Iranian journalist called "" Mousavi 's green campaign tsunami "" .
From last week 's public presence in streets , many believe that Mir Hussein Mousavi should win the Iranian election ."
2009-06-13,"Iran faces political turmoil after hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was confirmed today as the winner of the presidential election and outraged supporters of his chief rival took to the streets to protest against a "" dangerous charade "" after a record 85 % turnout .
Tonight riot police in Tehran confronted thousands of demonstrators shouting "" death to dictatorship "" amid shock and confusion after the official result backed Ahmadinejad 's claim to have won , made barely an hour after polls closed last night .
The moderate Mir Hossein Mousavi , who had been widely expected to beat the controversial incumbent if there was a high turnout - or at least do well enough to trigger a second round - insisted he was the victor and appealed against the result to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader .
"" I personally strongly protest the many obvious violations and I 'm warning I will not surrender to this dangerous charade , "" said Mousavi , a former prime minister .
"" The result will jeopardise the pillars of the Islamic republic and establish tyranny . ""
But Khamenei replied that the election had been conducted fairly .
He ordered the three defeated candidates and their supporters to avoid "" provocative "" behaviour . ""
All Iranians must support and help the elected president , "" he warned .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said she hoped the election result reflected the "" genuine will and desire "" of Iranian citizens .
Ahmadinejad 's crushing and contested victory by 63 % to 34 % is a grave setback for hopes of a solution to the crisis over Iran 's nuclear ambitions and for détente with the US now that Barack Obama is seeking dialogue with Tehran .
Israel reacted immediately by demanding intensified efforts to stop Iran acquiring nuclear weapons .
A second four - year term for Ahmadinejad torpedoes prospects for the freedoms and economic competence Mousavi had promised Iran 's 72 million people , creating a vibrant , youth - driven "" green "" reformist movement which had been peaceful until tonight 's clashes . ""
The regime is making a decision to shape the direction of Iran for the next decade , "" Saeed Laylaz , a political analyst , said .
"" I 'm sure they did n't even count the votes .
I do not accept this result .
It is false .
It should be the opposite .
If Ahmadinejad is president again Iran will be more isolated and more aggressive .
But he is the choice of the regime . ""
Scuffles took place in Tehran last night but trouble escalated today after riot police cordoned off the interior ministry where the election result was declared .
Clashes also took place outside the Mousavi campaign HQ , where several journalists were detained .
Hundreds of demonstrators wearing Mousavi 's signature green colours marched down Vali Asr Avenue towards the ministry , burning tyres and shouting "" Mousavi , give us our votes back "" and "" the election was full of lies "" , before being dispersed .
Laylaz had warned before the result that a second presidential term for Ahmadinejad could create a "" Tiananmen - type "" situation in Iran .
Ominously , as three weeks of campaigning drew to a close last Wednesday , an official of the powerful Revolutionary Guard Corps warned that any attempt at a popular "" revolution "" would be crushed .
Overt signs of repression included the failure of phone lines for hours after the polls closed and the blocking of the English and Persian - language websites of the BBC and Voice of America - which are regularly attacked by the Iranian authorities as "" imperialist "" .
Text messaging also failed .
Foreign diplomats scrambled to make sense of the reversal .
Fraud had been expected but not on the apparently massive scale required to produce an outcome almost diametrically opposite to what had been predicted by the Mousavi camp and independent analysts .
Yesterday 's excitement in the opposition camp gave way to fury .
"" It 's shameful , they have rigged the polls , "" said technician Majidreza Askari .
"" What would you expect from the interior ministry of a liar president ?
Ahmadinejad lies in front of the whole nation on state - run TV . ""
Samaneh Younes , a nurse demonstrating in Vanak Square , Tehran , said : "" How is it possible that Mousavi did n't even get good results in his own province ?
How is it possible that there were no blank votes ?
Why did n't the government provide enough ballot papers in big cities where Mousavi had a huge number of supporters ? """
2009-06-13,"Veteran observers of Middle East politics allow their expectations to swing only between the poles of gloom and despair .
History leaves little ground for optimism .
The declaration yesterday by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of his own convincing victory in Iran 's presidential election confirms that view .
Opposition supporters believe the poll was rigged and dispute the result .
Whatever the truth of the matter , the immediate outcome is that Mr Ahmadinejad 's hold on power looks firmer , but also more brittle .
The election campaign revealed a plurality of opinion in Iran and an appetite for open debate , especially among the large constituency of young Iranians who want engagement with the outside world .
They were no doubt emboldened by the prospect of rapprochement with the US .
President Obama 's more conciliatory tone towards the country has made it harder for Iranian conservatives to portray enthusiasm for the west as treason .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's hardline stance was inadvertently legitimised by George W Bush 's bellicosity .
But Mr Ahmadinejad 's renewed hold on power is a problem for the White House .
President Obama 's Middle East strategy relies on momentum - showing people in the region and at home that diplomacy works .
That is nowhere more true than in relations with another intransigent regional power - Israel .
The country 's prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , is due to give a much anticipated speech today responding to President Obama 's calls for him to stop expanding settlements on occupied Palestinian land .
Mr Netanyahu is under enormous domestic pressure not to concede the point , let alone admit the need for a viable Palestinian state .
Justice demands that he do both , but so does cold strategic logic .
Israel 's interests are served by the increase of US influence elsewhere in the region , which means acknowledging the wisdom of Mr Obama 's moderate stance towards Iran and the Arab world .
In Iran 's election campaign , if not in the result , there were hints that the US strategy of intelligent diplomacy can work .
Mr Netanyahu could shore up the strategy by making concessions of his own .
That is the hope .
But experience of the Middle East warns against indulging it ."
2009-06-13,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has won a crushing victory in Iran 's landmark presidential election , according to the country 's authorities , but his moderate challenger Mir Hossein Mousavi has warned of "" tyranny "" and protested that the result was rigged after a record turnout of 84 % .
As the official results were announced , baton - wielding riot police clashed with angry Mousavi supporters in some of the most serious unrest Tehran has seen in years .
Riot police on motorbikes used batons to disperse Mousavi supporters who staged a sit - in near the interior ministry , where the results were announced .
Up to 2,000 Mousavi supporters erected barricades of burning tyres and chanted "" Mousavi take back our vote !
What happened to our vote ? ""
Reporters saw police attacking the demonstrators , and several protesters were carried away .
The BBC showed footage of police attacking protesters , some of whom threw stones at the officers .
In another main street of Tehran , about 300 young people blocked the avenue by forming a human chain and chanted "" Ahmadi , shame on you .
Leave the government alone . ""
Mobile phone text messages were jammed , and news and social networking websites – including the Guardian , the BBC and Facebook – as well as pro - Mousavi websites were blocked or difficult to access . ""
The election was a game and full of lies , "" shouted one protester .
"" We can not do anything here , "" said another .
"" We can not believe the results and they are unacceptable . ""
Mousavi appealed directly to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei but the country 's supreme leader today threw his weight behind Ahmadinejad , urging the other candidates to support the president .
Mousavi said this morning : "" I personally strongly protest the many obvious violations and I 'm warning I will not surrender to this dangerous charade .
The result of such performance by some officials will jeopardise the pillars of the Islamic Republic and will establish tyranny . ""
But Khamenei , who has final say on all state matters , called the result a "" divine assessment "" and called on all Iranians to support Ahmadinejad .
Speaking on state television this afternoon , he said : "" I assume that enemies intend to eliminate the sweetness of the election with their hostile provocation . ""
Mousavi , a former prime minister , had been widely expected to trounce the controversial incumbent , or at least do well enough to trigger a run - off .
He claimed victory in an apparent attempt to pre - empt his rival .
But as the votes were still being counted late on Friday , aides to Ahmadinejad announced that he had won by an "" unassailable "" margin .
Polling stations had stayed open four extra hours to meet the huge demand .
The interior minister , Sadeq Mahsouli , said this afternoon that Ahmadinejad had won an overwhelming victory of 62.63 % to Mousavi 's 33.75 % .
Even in Mousavi 's hometown province of Tabriz in north - west Iran , the ministry claimed Ahmadinejad received more than 60 % of the vote .
Early editions of Mousavi 's paper Kalemeh Sabz , or the Green Word , and other reformist dailies declared Mousavi the victor but were ordered to change their headlines , local journalists said .
The papers had blank spots where articles were removed .
The outcome seems a grave setback to hopes for a solution to the looming international crisis over Iran 's nuclear ambitions and for détente with the US in response to Barack Obama 's overtures .
Israel quickly demanded efforts to stop Iran acquiring nuclear weapons .
"" It does n't augur well for an early and peaceful settlement of the nuclear dispute , "" said Mark Fitzpatrick at London 's International Institute for Strategic Studies .
Israel 's deputy foreign minister , Danny Ayalon , said : "" If there was a shadow of hope for a change in Iran , the renewed choice of Ahmadinejad expresses more than anything the growing Iranian threat .
"" If the result stands it will spell an end to hopes for the greater freedoms and economic competence Mousavi had promised Iran 's 72 million people .
At times the election campaign seemed like a referendum on Ahmadinejad 's four - year term .
The high turnout underscored the stakes domestically .
Mousavi 's slick ­campaign galvanised an apathetic electorate and raised hopes of a more stable economy and increased liberty at home as well as better relations abroad .
Supporters had hoped Mousavi could have a similarly positive effect to Mohammad Khatami , who ushered in a period of change that ended when Ahmadinejad came from nowhere to capture the presidency four years ago .
Trita Parsi , the president of the Washington - based National Iranian American Council , expressed disbelief at the wide margin in Ahmadinejad 's favour .
"" It is difficult to feel comfortable that this occurred without any cheating , "" Parsi told Reuters .
Ali Ansari , who heads the Institute for Iranian Studies at St Andrews University in Scotland , warned : "" The potential for unrest is high . ""
As three weeks of often passionate campaigning drew to a close on Wednesday , the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) issued an ominous warning that any attempt at a popular "" revolution "" would be crushed ."
2009-06-13,"Iran 's volatile presidential election drew to a dramatic but contested close with claims of victory by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his challenger , Mir ­Hossein Mousavi .
The head of Iran 's electoral ­commission said Ahmadinejad had taken 69 % of the vote after 5 million were counted – shortly after Mousavi , a former prime minister , said he had won .
The dispute , heralding possibly serious trouble , followed a four - hour extension to cope with a huge turnout that left thousands of people still queuing at ­polling stations as darkness fell .
"" I am the definite winner of this ­presidential election , "" Mousavi told a press conference , where he complained of widespread irregularities .
The official result is due to be announced today .
Interior ministry sources predicted a turnout of 70 % or more , approaching the nearly 80 % when the reformist ­Muhammad
Khatami – now backing Mousavi – won the 1997 election and ushered in a more relaxed period at home and in Iran 's relations abroad .
If no candidate gets 50 % , the two top contenders go forward to a run off next week .
Two other candidates would drop out .
Iran 's 10th presidential election has been watched intently around the world , much of which would like to see the back of Ahmadinejad ( below ) after four turbulent years .
The hope is for detente on the nuclear issue , the Middle East and relations with the US .
"" Whoever ends up winning , the fact that there has been a robust debate ­hopefully will advance our ability to engage them [ the Iranians ] in new ways , "" Barack Obama said .
The high turnout underscored the stakes domestically .
Mousavi 's slick ­campaign ­galvanised an apathetic electorate and raised hopes of a more stable economy and more liberty at home as well as better relations abroad .
At one polling station in Tehran 's ­Valiasr Avenue – a playground of honking cars , bikes and exuberant protesters for the last few nights – a policeman with a machine gun was on guard , but the atmosphere was relaxed .
Businessman Hadi Hajiabbas did not vote in the 2005 election but had just chosen Mousavi , largely for his economic skills .
"" He 's older and has more experience , "" said Hajiabbas .
Iranians recognise that while their vote is free its effect is limited : whoever becomes president – and all candidates were vetted in advance – must still answer to the "" supreme leader "" , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who wields religious and temporal authority over important issues .
Supporters hope Mousavi could have a similarly positive effect to Khatami , who ushered in a period of change that ended when Ahmadinejad came from nowhere to capture the presidency four years ago .
Ahmadinejad supporters were out in force for Friday midday prayers at Tehran ­University – that uniquely Iranian ­combination of religion and agitprop – and rebuffed questions about his nuclear ambitions and Holocaust denial as chants of "" death to America "" boomed from the mosque 's loudspeakers . ""
Ahmadinejad has served the people well , "" said Javad Muradi , a theological student with a trimmed beard and grey robes , who urged the ­Guardian to "" tell the truth "" before agreeing to speak .
"" He has special abilities and is able to respond to our enemies , "" Muradi said .
"" Naturally the Zionists wo n't ever say anything positive about us .
Obama said in Egypt that we have the right to nuclear technology .
"" Things looked and sounded different in Shahrak Gharb , an opulent north Tehran suburb in the shadow of the snow - capped Elborz mountains .
The female voters there were not in black chadors but wore designer sunglasses and make - up with stylish tunics and jeans under loosely draped headscarves .
Tina and Nastiham , a couple in their 20s , explained why they were backing Mousavi .
Shortly before their recent wedding they were arrested by the morality police while sitting in their car with their pet chihuahua .
They escaped conviction , but were scarred by the experience . ""
First it was the dog , "" laughed Tina , "" then my bad hijab –
my scarf was purple .
"" Grievances about personal freedoms , economic mismanagement , ­Ahmadinejad 's style and Iran 's global image are powerful motives for change , but a country that has experienced one revolution does not easily seek another .
Kurdish construction worker Amjad Abdollazadeh voted for Mousavi too . ""
Ahmadinejad was n't that bad , "" he said , queuing to buy an ice cream for his wife . ""
But Mousavi will be better . ""

This has been corrected ."
2009-06-14,"The defeated Iranian presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi today launched a formal appeal against the election result as his supporters took to the streets of the capital again , raising the prospect of more violent clashes .
Mousavi , who claimed his defeat by the hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was manipulated , said in a statement on his website that he had appealed to the ruling guardian council to overturn the result , and urged his supporters to continue protests "" in a peaceful and legal way .
"" We have asked officials to let us hold a nationwide rally to let people display their rejection of the election process and its results , "" said Mousavi .
With temperatures at 35C , the situation in the Iranian capital threatened to run out of control earlier today , as special forces in riot gear chased protesters through side streets near Fatemi Square .
In a sign of the anger among Mousavi 's supporters , they chanted "" the president is committing a crime and the supreme leader is supporting him "" , highly inflammatory language in a regime where the supreme leader , Ali Khamenei , is considered irreproachable .
Shops , government offices and businesses closed early as tension mounted .
Crowds also gathered outside Mousavi 's headquarters but there was no sign of Ahmadinejad 's chief political rival .
Supporters waved their fists and chanted anti - Ahmadinejad slogans .
Mousavi 's wife denied rumours that her husband had been placed under house arrest .
"" People are tired of dictatorship , "" she told Reuters .
"" People are tired of not having freedom of expression , of high inflation , and adventurism in foreign relations .
That is why they wanted to change Ahmadinejad . ""
Mousavi 's newspaper , Kalemeh Sabz , or the Green Word , did not appear on news stands today .
An editor speaking anonymously said authorities had been upset with Mousavi 's statements .
The paper 's website reported that more than 10 m votes in Friday 's election were missing national identification numbers similar to US social security numbers , which made the votes "" untraceable "" .
The president , who will address his supporters in a victory rally later today , was dismissive of the protests in a speech .
"" These [ protests ] are not important and these are natural , "" he said .
He said Iran 's elections were the "" model of democracy "" and accused "" western oppressors "" of criticising the election process . ""
On Friday 's election , the people of Iran emerged victorious , "" he declared .
He also said the country 's nuclear issue "" belongs in the past "" , an indication that he would not halt the programme that western leaders believe is geared towards creating weapons of mass destruction , despite the olive branch offered by the US president , Barack Obama .
Tens of thousands of flag - waving Ahmadinejad supporters gathered in the capital 's Valiasr Square for the president 's victory speech this evening , as he attempted a show of force he hopes will quell opposition protests .
The US vice - president , Joe Biden , said he had doubts about "" the way they 're suppressing crowds , the way in which people are being treated "" , although , using guarded language , he said the US had to accept "" for the time being "" Tehran 's claim that Ahmadinejad won a resounding re - election .
"" There 's an awful lot of questions about how this election was run , "" said Biden .
"" We do n't have enough facts to make a firm judgment . ""
The French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , said today that his government was worried about the situation and criticised "" the somewhat brutal reaction "" by authorities in response to demonstrations .
The EU said in a statement it was "" concerned about alleged irregularities "" during Friday 's vote .
Last night saw violent clashes after Ahmadinejad was confirmed as the winner of the presidential election on Friday , barely an hour after the polls had closed .
Protesters set fire to rubbish bins and tyres , creating pillars of black smoke among the apartment blocks and office buildings in central Tehran .
An empty bus was engulfed in flames on a side road .
Police fought back with clubs , including mobile squads on motorcycles swinging truncheons , as protesters hurled stones and bottles at officers , shouting "" Mousavi , give us our votes back "" and "" the election was full of lies "" .
More than 100 reformists , including Mohammad Reza Khatami , the brother of former president Mohammad Khatami , were arrested last night , according to leading reformist Mohammad Ali Abtahi .
He told Reuters they were members of Iran 's leading reformist party , Mosharekat .
A judiciary spokesman denied they had been arrested but said they were summoned and "" warned not to increase tension "" before being released .
Protests also broke out yesterday in the cities of Tabriz , Orumieh , Hamedan and Rasht .

Speaking live on the air , he said : "" A number of people who are armed ... I do n't know exactly who they are , but they have started to fire on people , causing havoc in Azadi Square . ""
Local residents said they had heard shooting in three districts of northern Tehran .
Earlier , the defeated candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi addressed the crowd in his first public appearance since Friday 's disputed election .
Addressing the crowd from the roof of his car , Mousavi said he was ready to compete in a fresh election.""The vote of the people is more important than Mousavi or any other person , "" he said , according to al - Jazeera television .
The gathering followed an announcement from Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , that he had ordered an investigation into claims vote - rigging had given the incumbent president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , a landslide victory .
The rally had been banned by the authorities and was initially called off by Mousavi amid fears of violence .
But tens of thousands of people , dressed in Mousavi 's green campaign colours , took to the streets , chanting "" God is great "" and "" We fight , we die – we will not accept this vote - rigging "" .
Calling on Ahmadinejad to resign , they said the election results were a "" coup d'etat "" and chanted "" Death to the lying government "" .
"" I just want to show the president that we are not bandits .
I want my vote back , "" Maryam Sedaghati , a supporter , told Reuters .
Scuffles broke out as Ahmadinejad supporters on motorbikes used sticks to beat the marchers .
Mousavi had attempted to cancel the rally after receiving warnings that militias responsible for policing it would be equipped with live ammunition .
The rally had been banned by Iran 's interior ministry , which declared the gathering "" illegal "" .
Iran has been plunged into turmoil since Friday when the government declared that Ahmadinejad had won , a claim his rivals immediately disputed .
Iran 's leaders spent the weekend urging people to accept the result but today Khamenei ordered an investigation into allegations of vote - rigging and fraud .
Iranian state television said he had told the guardian council , the clerical body that oversees elections , to examine Mousavi 's claims of widespread vote - rigging .
The guardian council was reported to have said it would take no more than 10 days to hand down its ruling after complaints from Mousavi and another candidate , Mohsen Rezai .
"" Mousavi and Rezai appealed yesterday .
After the official announcement [ of the appeal ] , the guardian council has seven to 10 days to see if it was a healthy election or not , "" the ISNA news agency quoted a council spokesman , Abbasali Kadkhodai , as saying .
The news represents a surprising turnaround for Khamenei , who had previously welcomed the results .
"" Issues must be pursued through a legal channel , "" state TV quoted Khamenei as saying .
The supreme leader said he had "" insisted that the guardian council carefully probe this letter "" .
Iranian TV quoted Khamenei as urging Mousavi to try to keep the violence from escalating and saying , "" It is necessary that activities are done with dignity . ""
The UN secretary - general Ban Ki - moon today called on Iran 's leaders to heed "" the genuine will of Iranian people "" , but stopped short of fully endorsing Khamenei 's call for a re - examination of the election result .
"" The position of me and the United Nations is that the genuine will of Iranian people should be fully respected .
I 'm closely following how this investigation into this election result will come out , "" he said .
Ahmadinejad claimed the election results were fair and compared the protests over the past three days to the passion shown by football fans after a game .
But in a further sign of the escalating tensions , he put off a planned visit to Russia , cancelling a meeting planned for today with President Dmitry Medvedev .
Reports continued to spread that dozens of leading members of the opposition had been detained , and that security forces had last night raided a dormitory at Tehran University , killing three people and injuring 15 .
The reports could not be confirmed .
The official result – 63 % for Ahmadinejad and 34 % for Mousavi – means four more years for the president and an end to hopes for reform at home as well as , perhaps , detente with the west .
All three contenders to the presidency , reformist and conservative , have raised serious doubts about the result .
Mousavi claimed that , on Friday night , he had been informed by the interior ministry that he had won the election convincingly .
That claim was first published on a popular website that was subsequently closed down .
There were also reports of a leaked interior ministry figures allegedly suggesting Mousavi had won .
EU foreign ministers today expressed "" serious concern "" over the fraud allegations and called for an investigation into the conduct of the election .
Small groups of Ahmadinejad supporters gathered outside the British and French embassies in Tehran , protesting at European "" interference "" in the elections .
Ahmadinejad has rejected claims of fraud as a "" psychological war "" by the foreign media ."
2009-06-15,"The man accused by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of masterminding the opposition campaign to oust him from the presidency has dropped out of view since election day .
But Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani remains a formidable figure in Iranian politics with a network of well - placed allies straddling the reformist and moderate conservative camps .
If any one leader is able to force a re - run of last Friday 's disputed poll , it may be the two - term former president nicknamed the "" shark "" .
Rafsanjani was last heard from in public as he cast his vote on Friday .
According to the Iranian Students News Agency , he called for a "" clean "" poll and said a big turnout ( favouring the reformists ) would boost Iran 's regional and international image .
Following the ensuing storm over Ahmadinejad 's apparent victory , al - Arabiya television reported Rafsanjani had resigned as chairman of the Assembly of Experts and of the Expediency Council , two key government bodies .
This report remains unconfirmed .
More intriguing are similarly unsubstantiated claims that Rafsanjani is in the holy city of Qom , where he once studied and where he has strong links to a moderate clerical body , the Association of Combatant Clergy .
Rafsanjani was said to be assessing whether he has sufficient votes in the 86-member Assembly of Experts to dismiss Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the Supreme Leader and Ahmadinejad 's chief patron .
Under Iran 's constitution , only the assembly has the power to do this .
The super - rich Rafsanjani , his family , and his supporters in the reformist Kargozaran party make no bones about helping finance and direct Mir Hossein Mousavi 's campaign to topple Ahmadinejad , whom they despise .
But with Mousavi ostensibly beaten , the developing post - election struggle now pits Rafsanjani against Khamenei rather than the president – who is widely seen as a mouthpiece for the hardline fundamentalism typified by the Supreme Leader .
Although he is supposed to stay above the fray , Khamenei endorsed Ahmadinejad this time , just as in the second round of the 2005 election .
Rafsanjani has made no secret of his belief that foreign and economic policies pursued during the past four years under Khamenei 's guidance have seriously damaged the Islamic Republic .
His frustrations came to a head last week after Ahmadinejad was allowed to publicly accuse him of corruption .
In an angry letter he lambasted Khamenei for failing to uphold the country 's dignity .
In what was in effect an unprecedented challenge to Khamenei 's authority , he implied the Supreme Leader , normally above criticism , was negligent , partial , and possibly involved in plans to steal the election .
"" I am expecting you to resolve this position in order to extinguish the fire , whose smoke can be seen in the atmosphere , and to foil dangerous plots , "" Rafsanjani wrote .
"" If the system can not or does not want to confront such ugly and sin - infected phenomena as insults , lies and false allegations , how can we consider ourselves followers of the sacred Islamic system ? ""
Rafsanjani remains unpopular with many Iranians who believe the corruption claims and blame him for a murderous , covert campaign to silence dissidents at home and abroad during his 1989 - 97 presidency .
Those latter allegations earned him another nickname : the "" grey eminence "" .
At the same time he is respected as one of the Islamic revolution 's founding fathers and a close associate of its first leader , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini .
As a result he can count on some powerful friends if he decides to try to shame Khamenei into allowing an election re - run or standing down .
Apart from his clerical allies in Qom , prominent establishment conservatives such as Ali Akbar Velayati and Ali Akbar Nateq - Nuri have criticised Ahmadinejad .
So , too , has Ali Larijani , the influential Majlis ( parliament ) speaker and former national security chief .
The mayor of Tehran , Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf , is another potential ally , as are the former president Mohammad Khatami , Mousavi , the other defeated presidential candidates , and their millions of thwarted supporters .
If mobilised , his would comprise an elite coalition operating inside the hierarchy of the Islamic Republic , rather than from outside on the streets .
It would not be a democratic movement ; but it would be a dagger held to Khamenei 's breast .
Not for nothing is the Machiavellian Rafsanjani , pistachio nut millionaire , pragmatist and ruthless political survivor , known by yet another nickname : the "" kingmaker "" .
Iran awaits his next move ."
2009-06-15,"At least 12 people may have died in violent clashes with Iran 's security forces following President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's disputed re - election , ­according to reports from the country .
The reported fatalities have come amid a brutal crackdown on students , apparently aimed at quelling a wave of campus rebellions that authorities fear could spill over to the wider population .
A Farsi website , Balatarin , carried an unconfirmed report that seven people had been killed in the southern city of Shiraz following confrontations with riot police at the local university .
Five busloads of plainclothes officers had been sent to confront the demonstrators during Sunday 's protests , but were said to have been unable to prevent them from being joined by members of the public and marching to one of the city 's main squares .
It is unclear whether all those said to have died were students .
The Guardian understands that five students may also have died in clashes at Tehran University early on Sunday .
The students – named as Fatemeh Barati , Kasra Sharafi , Mobina Ehterami , Kambiz Shoaee and Mohsen Imani – are believed to have been buried today in Behesht - e - Zahra , a famous cemetery in Tehran , reportedly without their families being informed .
Autnews , a student website , claimed that plain clothes officers used firearms against students after forcing their way onto the campus .
Students were said to have sought refuge in toilets after police raided halls of residence , where rooms were ransacked and beds set on fire .
Tonight Ali Larijani , the speaker of Iran 's parliament , appointed a committee of MPs to investigate the reports .
The reported fatalities appeared to be backed up by one witness , who said a force of around 300 plainclothes and riot police joined basij forces ( militia volunteers ) to attack the students .
"" We had nowhere to hide but the toilets and bathrooms , and they shouted : ' You traitors to the Islamic republic , you bastards , leave the building or we 'll shoot you all . '
Many students were severely wounded – we could hear injured students groaning and shouting for help , "" the witness said .
"" At 3 am they announced on loudspeakers : ' If you evacuate the building we wo n't harm you .
Otherwise , you 'll all be injured or killed . '
All the students then came out of the building in lines , with their hands on their heads .
The police hit them with batons and some started to shout that they had conquered the dorms .
Eventually they let us go back to our rooms but at least 10 had been shot , some appeared to have been killed and hundreds were injured . ""
Another witness , Majidreza Sobhani , 21 , a mechanical engineering student , said police smashed locks to force their way into students ' rooms .
"" I ca n't describe what they did to me and friends .
Just go to our dorms and see what our rooms look like , "" he said .
Violent incidents were reported at Isfahan University , where 60 students were taken into custody following clashes that left halls of residence badly damaged .
Some students were said to have been injured after being thrown from upstairs windows .
Protests also took place at Hamedan University and Babol University in Mazandaran province on the Caspian Sea , where demonstrations are said to have spread to four towns after police attacked students .
Riot police surrounded the campus of Tabriz University , which has historically been a hotbed of radical protest .
Anger was apparent too at Amir Kabir University in Tehran , where Ahmadinejad was forced to flee the campus after angry protests more than two years ago .
Some 150 lecturers and around 500 students staged a sit - in at the campus mosque , mirroring an action by academics at another Tehran institution , Sharif University , on Sunday ."
2009-06-16,"Tens of thousands have taken to the streets of Tehran , the country 's clerics have ordered a recount in several areas , and his grip on power is looking increasingly weak .
But today Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took time out from the turmoil engulfing Iran to drop into a regional summit in Russia , taking a break from the anti - government protests following Friday 's disputed ­Iranian presidential election .
Smiling broadly , and looking remarkably untouched by the crisis back home , President Ahmadinejad met Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , in the city of Yekaterinburg .
He pumped Medvedev 's hand warmly .
Medvedev was hosting a meeting of the Shanghai Co - operation Organisation ( SCO ) , which represents a loose - knit group of central Asian nations , including Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , Tajikistan , Kyrgyzstan , as well as China and Russia .
Iran is one of several observers , together with India and Pakistan .
While Iran 's powerful guardian council announced a partial recount of Friday 's disputed vote today , the SCO group formally congratulated Ahmadinejad on his landslide win .
Their willingness to overlook apparently glaring irregularities in Friday 's poll is hardly a surprise .
None of the SCO member states can be described as proper democracies ; central Asia 's leaders , moreover , are all a bunch of super - presidents , apparently in the job for life .
Should Ahmadinejad eventually be swept from power , his decision to fly to Yekaterinburg will probably go down in history as his Paris moment – recalling Margaret Thatcher 's ill - fated decision in 1990 to leave Downing Street for a European summit while her Tory enemies , led by Michael Heseltine , plotted to remove her .
Other leaders in the wrong place at the wrong time include Mikhail Gorbachev , then Soviet president , who was on holiday in the Crimea in August 1991 when a group of KGB hardliners led an unsuccessful coup attempt .
After three days of house arrest he managed to fly back from his dacha .
Ahmadinejad was supposed to have turned up to the summit yesterday but in the end his trip was brief and little more than symbolic : a few pleasantries with Medvedev , a quick round - table in Yekaterinburg 's Hyatt hotel , and then off home .
The Iranian president scrapped a press conference scheduled for later today .
Before he went , Ahmadinejad did manage to utter a few words .
Not on the chaos enveloping Iran , but on the United States – a failing empire , as he put it .
"" America is in the grip of political and economic crisis , "" he told the SCO leaders , according to Reuters , adding : "" The United States and its allies are unable to deal with the crisis . ""
The Kremlin , meanwhile , expressed satisfaction today that Ahmadinejad had made his first foreign trip to Russia .
The two countries share a basic antipathy towards the US . ""
The Iranian elections are the internal affair of Iran , "" the deputy foreign minister , Sergei Ryabkov , explained .
"" We welcome the fact that elections took place , we welcome the new president on Russian soil and see it as symbolic that he made his first visit to Russia .
This allows hope for progress in bilateral relations .
"" Iran 's president , who helps rule the world 's fifth - largest oil producer , has made a tradition of stealing the limelight at conferences , including an SCO meeting in Shanghai in 2006 that was dominated by news about Tehran 's nuclear programme ."
2009-06-16,"Four days after Iran 's presidential elections , there remained a yawning gap between the two competing versions of what actually happened .
Official results gave 63 % of the vote to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and 34 % to Mirhossein Mousavi , the strongest opposition candidate , with tiny votes going to the two other contenders .
The Mousavi camp say the true result – allegedly leaked by the interior ministry – had its candidate winning more than 60 % of the vote .
The quarrel is therefore not over a handful of stuffed ballot boxes or a few contentious provinces , but over more than 10 m votes .
Since the controversial and hasty crowning of Ahmadinejad only hours after the polls closed , the numbers have been subjected to intense statistical scrutiny by experts around the world , but so far no "" smoking gun "" has been found hidden in the numbers , and the debate is as fierce as ever .
The strongest independent support for Ahmadinejad 's claims has come from a surprising quarter – American political scientists .
Ken Ballen , the head of a think tank called Terror Free Tomorrow :
The Center for Public Opinion , and Patrick Doherty , of the New America Foundation revealed that they had carried out a phone poll across all 30 provinces three weeks before the vote that gave Ahmadinejad a 2 - 1 lead , consistent with the official results .
A high - powered political couple , Flynt and Hillary Mann Leverett , who both worked in the Bush White House , endorsed this view , also pointing out that his official share of the vote on Friday was almost identical to the second round result in 2005 .
Their widely read article on the matter was entitled "" Ahmadinejad won .
Get over it . ""
Yesterday , this analysis came under criticism from other specialists .
Nate Silver , an electoral guru who won plaudits for correctly predicting the outcome of the US presidential elections , pointed out that while the Ballen - Doherty poll had indeed revealed a 2 - 1 preference for Ahmadinejad over Mousavi , it had not given the president a majority .
In the poll 27 % said they did not know which way they would vote , and 15 % refused to tell the pollsters .
For the official result to be accurate , the president would have to have won an overwhelming majority of these floating voters , even though a majority of those questioned in the Ballen - Doherty poll expressed views that suggested they were not natural Ahmadinejad supporters .
Nearly 70 % favoured Iran working cooperatively with the US to end the conflict in Iraq , and only 28 % thought that the president had fulfilled his election promise to "" put oil money on the tables of the people themselves "" .
Mousavi supporters point to other , circumstantial evidence that the authorities rigged the vote .
They say opposition election monitors were excluded from polling stations before the vote and that the Supreme Leader 's declaration in Ahmadinejad 's favour the same night broke election rules that allow for three days of counting and verification .
Only a new vote with new rules and independent monitoring is likely to end the argument , and so far Iran 's ultimate rulers have refused to contemplate such an outcome ."
2009-06-16,"Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , last night dismissed protests over last week 's election as the work of "" tension seekers "" following a fourth day of protests in Tehran , and appeared to rule out any change to the outcome of the poll by referring to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as the "" elected president "" .
Khamenei 's appeal for calm followed an apparent concession when the regime promised to recount some votes cast in Friday 's disputed election , officially won by Ahmadinejad .
But the authorities rejected demands by the defeated Mir Hossein Mousavi to annul the election .
Khamenei 's intervention came as Mousavi 's supporters , many wearing ­signature green wristbands and ­ribbons , rallied in their thousands last night ­outside the Tehran headquarters of ­Iranian state TV , after a separate demonstration in favour of Ahmadinejad .
The protest lasted from about 5 pm to 8 pm and about 100 people were still protesting in front of state TV around 9.45pm .
Some fires had been lit and a motorcycle set on fire , but security forces did not intervene .
Posts on Twitter seemed to suggest that there were still pockets of unrest .
One user who has been posting messages about the situation in Tehran said there had been reports of street fighting in Azadi square and the surrounding streets with pepper gas being used by security forces .
Earlier the poster said hundreds had been arrested during the day , and that as the night wore on Basij militamen were ­causing trouble .
As the night went on the user posted : "" Our lives are in real danger now - we are the eyes - they need to stop us . ""
But numbers on the streets yesterday were far fewer than the 500,000 to 1 ­million who took part in a mass opposition protest in the capital on Monday , when Basij ­militiamen shot dead at least one demonstrator and wounded several others .
In all seven ­people were reported killed .
According to the official result , Ahmadinejad won 63 % of the vote to 34 % for Mousavi , a moderate former prime minister and architect .
Ominously , the government ordered ­foreign journalists not ­permanently based in Iran to leave the country at once , and banned resident correspondents from reporting from the streets , a move seen as possibly heralding an intensification of the crackdown .
The regime appeared to be following a dual strategy of partial concessions on ­Friday 's vote combined with arrests of opposition figures who could give ­coherence to the protests .
Those detained yesterday included Muhammad Ali Abtahi , an adviser to Mehdi Karroubi , and Saeed Hajarian , a Mousavi supporter .
In his remarks , Khamenei called for ­tolerance and said those disputing the result were ­tarnishing the ­""beautiful "" image created by the record 85 % turnout . ""
These people who are ­creating all this are just pursuing tension , "" he said .
"" Even if this result had n't come out this way , the same thing might have happened . ""
Last night 's rally outside TV ­headquarters in north Tehran was largely silent , as protesters carried black banners to mourn those killed in the past few days .
Mousavi had appealed to his supporters to stay off the streets and remain peaceful .
Analysts and observers were divided about the likely course of this crisis , the worst for the regime since the 1979 ­revolution .
Ali Ansari , of St Andrews ­University , said he expected it to end with the total annulment of the vote , ­suggesting that half measures would not ­satisfy the opposition camp .
"" The regime will fight hard to stop that happening , but in the end they will , "" he predicted .
"" I think it will get bloodier on the streets . ""
Others believe the mass protests may have peaked and expect a resolution to be worked out in behind - the - scenes contacts between Mousavi and the government .
Thousands of Ahmadinejad ­supporters who were bussed in for a mass rally in Tehran 's Vali Asr square , waved their fists and cheered as Gholam Ali Haddad Adel , a prominent ally of the president , told them : "" This nation will protect and defend its revolution in any way . ""
Unrest was also reported yesterday from the cities of Isfahan , Rasht and Tabriz .
But in Qom , headquarters of Iran 's clerical establishment , the only reported demonstrations have been against the former president , Hashemi Rafsanjani , seen as a key backer of Mousavi .
Nicolas Sarkozy , the French president , yesterday denounced the Iranian government 's "" brutal "" reaction to demonstrators .
In Washington , Barack Obama said he was "" deeply disturbed "" by the violence .
But he did not want to be seen as "" meddling "" in Iranian internal affairs .
In Israel , the head of Mossad , the intelligence agency , said he doubted that unrest would lead to any regime change .

This article was amended on Wednesday 17 June 2009 .
It referred to Muhammad Ali Abtahi as a supporter of Mir Hossein Mousavi .
We should have made clear that Abtahi is an adviser to Mehdi Karroubi .
This has been corrected ."
2009-06-16,"The offer of a recount of Iran 's ­presidential vote represents a climbdown by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader , who initially endorsed of the election result when he declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's victory a "" massive success "" and a "" divine blessing "" .
But it falls far short of the opposition demands .
Mir Hossein Mousavi , the leading opposition candidate , had called for a fresh election and he was reported to be reluctant to go along with a recount conducted by the guardian council , a deeply conservative group of Islamic jurists .
The council referred to the results declared by Khamenei as ­""provisional "" , an important symbolic concession .
"" It is possible that there may be some changes in the tally after the recount , "" said a spokesman , Abbasali Kadkhodai .
"" Based on the law , the demand of those candidates for the cancellation of the vote – this can not be considered , "" he told state television .
But observers said it was unlikely an establishment body such as the guardian council would rigorously assess how the election was conducted .
Half the council is appointed by Khamenei and its ­chairman , Ahmad Jannati , is a hardliner and Khamenei ally .
Another council spokesman said the vote had "" the least amount of violations reported "" of any Iranian election . ""
The business of vetting the election is going to be highly limited , "" said Sir Richard Dalton , Britain 's ambassador to Tehran from 2002 to 2006 .
"" In previous votes , the matter was investigated and then hushed up . ""
The council conducted a limited recount after the first round of the 2005 election , which put Ahmadinejad into the run - off against Hashemi Rafsanjani .
The recount was carried out behind closed doors .
The council gave the results a clean bill of health but did not publish its findings .
The situation this time is very different , there is far more pressure on the council and Khamenei from the street and from within the religious establishment , from important figures such as Rafsanjani .
But Rafsanjani is not a council member .
Without an ally within the council , a recount may prove of little use to the opposition .
Firstly it is supposed to be a limited recount , focusing on certain ballot boxes identified as questionable by the Mousavi camp or the two other defeated candidates whose complaints are being heard .
It is unclear whether the ­opposition camps will be able to call for a blanket recount of all polling stations in all provinces .
If such a recount was granted , an ­accurate and reliable tally may expose any discrepancies generated by electronic changes in the interior ministry 's computers , but as there is no chain of custody of the ballot boxes , it would be impossible to verify whether ballots were added ­wholesale after the vote .
Mousavi says his representatives were told to leave polling stations before voting began , so they were not able to witness the actual vote .
There were also a large number of mobile ballot boxes this year , aimed at allowing Iranians without transport or with work obligations to exercise their democratic rights .
But the mobile polling stations also represented an opportunity for ballot - stuffing that a simple recount would not uncover .
A recount could put to the test a Mousavi claim that 10 m ballots were cast without corresponding national identification numbers that would make them traceable .
But that again would require Mousavi 's lawyers having access to the recount process .
The recount poses a dilemma for the opposition : to participate may imply endorsement of a process of which it is highly suspicious .
To stand aloof takes away any chance of influencing the process and risks projecting the image of spoilers .
But Khamenei and the council also face a dilemma : admission of any rigging would dent the pure image of Iranian democracy they have attempted to project .
To deny any shortcomings , on the other hand , could trigger fury on the streets , and discredit the pillars of the Islamic republic ."
2009-06-16,"Iran 's post - election political unrest claimed its first confirmed fatality yesterday when shots were fired at supporters of the defeated presidential candidate , Mir Hossein Mousavi , who had defied an official ban on a mass rally in central Tehran .
Basij militiamen loyal to the hardline incumbent , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , were said to be responsible for the shooting , which took place as hundreds of thousands of pro - Mousavi demonstrators marched through the city centre to Azadi ( Freedom ) Square demanding the result of last Friday 's election be annulled .
Photographs taken at the scene appeared to show one man dead and several others with bullet wounds .
Precise figures were not available , but some estimates suggested that more than 500,000 people were involved in the protest against the election "" theft "" .
Such large - scale protest has not seen in Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution . ""
Mousavi we support you !
We will die but regain our votes , "" shouted supporters , many wearing the green of the moderate 's election campaign and carrying signs with the message "" Where is my vote ?
"" Several vehicles were set alight in Tehran 's streets and there were reports that protesters had taken to city rooftops at nightfall , shouting "" Death to the dictator "" .
Last night protesters promised they would be back on the streets again today .
The presence of huge crowds on the streets – and reports of other fatalities – appeared to dash earlier predictions that the unrest of the past three days would fade away .
There was also a fresh twist when it was announced that Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , had ordered the powerful guardian council to investigate claims of election fraud .
Diplomatic sources said this was not a major shift , suggesting that Khamenei had merely warned Mousavi that he should proceed with his fraud complaints carefully , using only "" legal "" means available to him .
Khamenei , who stands at the apex of Iran 's complex political system , endorsed the election result on Saturday , dashing opposition hopes that he might be persuaded to order a recount or even annul the result .
The guardian council , comprised of 12 senior clerics , said it would rule within 10 days on two official complaints it had received from Mousavi and Mohsen Rezaie , another election candidate .
The council vets candidates and must formally approve results for the outcome to stand .
The interior ministry , which announced the election result on Saturday , and the president have rejected charges of fraud .
Ahmadinejad compared protesters to football fans angry that their team had lost .
Questions were asked though how 40 million Iranian votes had been counted and the results announced so soon after the polls closed .
Observers were stunned by the size of the Tehran rally , in defiance of a ban .
And there was no sign of the anger diminishing : "" Many of my friends are in prison , "" said Saman Imani , a student beaten by police .
"" Iran is becoming a dictatorship .
Ahmadinejad is denying the Holocaust because he 's as brutal as Hitler was . ""
Ebrahim Yazdi , leader of the banned opposition Freedom Movement and a veteran of the revolution , warned that Ahmadinejad 's attacks on his opponents had opened a "" Pandora 's box "" which had led to a deep crisis within the regime . ""
The result of such a crisis now is that the rift among the ... personalities of the revolution is getting deeper , "" he said .
"" It is also between people and their government ... a rift between state and the nation .
It is the biggest crisis since the revolution . ""
Further reports tonight spoke of people in Isfahan , Ahwaz , Zahedan , Yazd and Mashhad shouting "" Allahu Akbar [ God is great ] "" in support of the Tehran demonstrations .
Mohammad Khatami , the reformist ex - president and a backer of Mousavi , attacked the government for banning the rally .
Ahmadinejad delayed a visit to Russia but was due to arrive tomorrow .
Concerned governments around the globe were watching the situation closely .
"" The implications are not yet clear , "" said David Miliband , the foreign secretary .
The US president , Barack Obama , said he was "" deeply troubled "" by the post - election violence .
"" It is up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran 's leaders will be .
We respect Iranian sovereignty and want to avoid the United States being the issue inside of Iran , "" he said , adding that Washington wanted to pursue a "" tough , direct "" dialogue with Tehran ."
2009-06-16,"Iranian hardliners attempts to resist the biggest uprising in decades seemed to be crumbling today after popular pressure forced officials to announce a recount of the country 's disputed presidential election .
Massive rallies in Tehran on Monday saw tens of thousands defy a ban to take to the streets to protest the declaring of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as the winner of Friday 's election over the more moderate Mir Hosein Mousavi .
Today the Iranian regime seemed to be reversing its position which had been to declare Ahmadinejad the winner by a landslide .
The aftermath of Monday 's massive rallies , said to be the biggest since the Iranian revolution , was reported to have left seven people dead , with further rallies expected today as the challenge to the Iranian regime intensified .
The powerful guardian council announced it was ready to hold a recount in areas disputed by opposition candidates .
No detail of the scope of the recount and who would carry it out were available .
The guardian council was reported to have said that a recount may lead to changes in the votes recorded for the candidates .
Iran 's post - election political unrest saw seven people killed in clashes between supporters of the defeated presidential candidate , Mousavi , and militiamen loyal to the hardline incumbent , Ahmadinejad , state radio reported this morning .
According to the report , seven people were killed as shooting erupted after a group at the protest "" tried to attack a military location "" last night , in western Tehran .
The first fatality came yesterday , when shots were fired at supporters of Mousavi , who had defied an official ban to march in their hundreds of thousands through the city centre to Azadi ( Freedom ) Square , demanding the result of last Friday 's election be annulled .
Basij militiamen linked to Iran 's powerful Revolutionary Guard were said to be responsible for the shooting .
Precise figures for the scale of the demonstration were not available , but some estimates suggested that more than 500,000 people were involved in the protest against the election "" theft "" .
Such large - scale protest has not been seen in Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution . ""

Khamenei , who stands at the apex of Iran 's complex political system , endorsed the election result on Saturday , dashing opposition hopes that he might be persuaded to order a recount or even annul the result .
The guardian council , comprised of 12 senior clerics , said it would rule within 10 days on two official complaints it had received from Mousavi and Mohsen Rezaie , another election candidate .
The council vets candidates and must formally approve results for the outcome to stand .
The interior ministry , which announced the election result on Saturday , and the president , have rejected charges of fraud .
Ahmadinejad compared protesters to football fans angry that their team had lost .
Questions were asked though how 40 m Iranian votes had been counted and the results announced so soon after the polls closed .
Observers were stunned by the size of the Tehran rally , in defiance of a ban .
And there was no sign of the anger diminishing : "" Many of my friends are in prison , "" said Saman Imani , a student beaten by police .
"" Iran is becoming a dictatorship .
Ahmadinejad is denying the Holocaust because he 's as brutal as Hitler was . ""
Ebrahim Yazdi , leader of the banned opposition Freedom Movement and a veteran of the revolution , warned that Ahmadinejad 's attacks on his opponents had opened a "" Pandora 's box "" which had led to a deep crisis within the regime . ""
The result of such a crisis now is that the rift among the ... personalities of the revolution is getting deeper , "" he said .
"" It is also between people and their government ... a rift between state and the nation .
It is the biggest crisis since the revolution . ""
Further reports last night spoke of people in Isfahan , Ahwaz , Zahedan , Yazd and Mashhad shouting "" Allahu Akbar [ God is great ] "" in support of the Tehran demonstrations .
Mohammad Khatami , the reformist ex - president and a backer of Mousavi , attacked the government for banning the rally .
Ahmadinejad initially delayed a visit to Russia but arrived in Yekaterinburg today , for talks at a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation .
Concerned governments around the globe were watching the situation closely .
"" The implications are not yet clear , "" said David Miliband , the foreign secretary .
The US president , Barack Obama , said he was "" deeply troubled "" by the post - election violence .
"" It is up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran 's leaders will be .
We respect Iranian sovereignty and want to avoid the United States being the issue inside of Iran , "" he said , adding that Washington wanted to pursue a "" tough , direct "" dialogue with Tehran ."
2009-06-16,"Iranian hardliners ' attempts to resist the country 's biggest uprising for decades appeared to be weakening today as popular pressure forced officials to announce a recount of disputed votes from Friday 's presidential elections .
In a move that appeared to represent a further concession from the authorities , the country 's powerful guardian council said it was ready to hold a recount in areas disputed by opposition candidates .
No details of the scope of the recount and who would carry it out were available , though the council said it had rejected opposition demands to annul the official result , which saw the hardline incumbent , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , declared winner by a landslide .
The council , which consists of 12 senior clerics , was reported to have said that a recount could lead to changes in the votes recorded for the candidates , but some analysts said it would not necessarily bring a change in the final result .
The decision by the guardian council follows the first known bloodshed of the crisis .At least seven people were killed yesterday after a rally in Tehran when tens of thousands of protesters jammed the streets in a show of defiance against the Iranian regime .
A rally scheduled for this afternoon by supporters of Mir Hossein Mousavi , who came second in the presidential poll according to the official results , was called off hours before it was due to start , but it remains likely that protesters will take to the streets .
Social networking sites used by Mousavi 's supporters had talked of fears that the rally would be attacked by militias they claimed were loyal to Ahmadinejad .
A spokesman for Mousavi was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying : "" Mousavi … urged his supporters not to attend today 's rally to protect their lives .
The moderates ' rally has been cancelled .
"" The same call for people to stay off the streets was made by Mousavi yesterday , but tens if not hundreds of thousands joined a seemingly spontaneous protest which had been banned by the regime .
A pro - Ahmadinejad rally is also to be held this afternoon , raising further fears of clashes between supporters of the two men .
Iran was again rocked today by a series of fast - moving and complex developments , sometimes seemingly contradictory , as the world watched the efforts of the once all - powerful establishment in the Islamic republic to control events .
In key developments today : •
Two major figures from the reformist movement were arrested .
Mohammad Ali Abtahi and Saeed Hajarian both supported Mousavi and were senior advisers to the former reformist president , Mohammad Khatami .
• Clashes and mass arrests were reported on university campuses of those supporting Mousavi .
•
State television claimed that the "" main agents "" in post - election unrest had been arrested with explosives and guns .
It gave no further details .
•
President Ahmadinejad left Iran to attend a summit in Russia where he failed to mention the crisis gripping his country .
This morning , state radio said the deaths of seven people happened when shooting erupted after a group at the protest "" tried to attack a military location "" in western Tehran .
The first fatality came as shots were fired at supporters of Mousavi who had marched in their thousands through the city centre to Azadi ( Freedom ) Square , demanding that the election result be annulled .
Basij militiamen linked to Iran 's powerful Revolutionary Guard were said to have been responsible for the shooting .
Precise figures for the scale of the demonstration were not available , but some estimates suggested that more than 500,000 people were involved in the protest against the election "" theft "" .
"" Mousavi , we support you !
We will die but regain our votes , "" supporters , many wearing the green of the moderate 's election campaign , shouted .
Many carried signs that read : "" Where is my vote ? ""
Several vehicles were set alight in Tehran 's streets , and there were reports that protesters had taken to city rooftops at nightfall yesterday , shouting "" death to the dictator "" .
The presence of huge crowds on the streets , and reports of other fatalities , appeared to dash earlier predictions that the unrest of the past three days would fade away .
There was a further twist yesterday when it was announced that Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , had ordered the guardian council to investigate claims of election fraud .
Diplomatic sources said this was not a major shift , suggesting Khamenei had merely warned Mousavi that he should proceed with his fraud complaints carefully , using only "" legal "" means available to him .

Ahmadinejad compared protesters to football fans angry that their team had lost .
However , questions were asked about how 40 m Iranian votes had been counted and the results announced so soon after the polls closed .
There was no sign of the anger diminishing .
"" Many of my friends are in prison , "" Saman Imani , a student who was beaten by police , said .
"" Iran is becoming a dictatorship .

2009-06-17,"Hundreds of thousands of Iranians ­protesting against the "" theft "" of last week 's presidential election took to the streets for a fifth consecutive day today­ , ­defying a ban on rallies as the regime arrested more reformists and enforced a crackdown on media coverage .
Mir Hossein Mousavi , the moderate who insists he beat the incumbent ­Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , called for ­further peaceful protests in mosques to mourn the victims of the worst unrest since the 1979 revolution .
At least seven people have been confirmed killed . ""
A number of our countrymen were wounded or martyred , "" the former prime minister said on his website .
"" I ask the people to express their solidarity with the families ... by coming together in mosques or taking part in peaceful demonstrations . ""
The interior ministry was reported to have ordered an investigation into an attack on Tehran University students by basij militiamen and police .
The government 's day - old ban on journalists reporting from the streets did not halt the broadcast of pictures of the ­protests , which showed many demonstrators wearing black clothes or ribbons , ­carrying pictures of the dead and injured , and ­making V for victory signs .
Iranian authorities accused foreign media of acting as the "" mouthpiece of rioters "" as Twitter , Facebook and other websites kept information flowing .
News organisations were flooded with amateur footage of protests while a state TV channel accused the US of "" intolerable "" interference .
The Iranian government summoned the Swiss ambassador , who represents US interests in Iran , to ­complain about American interference , state - run Press TV reported .
Barack Obama had reacted cautiously to developments in Iran , saying he shared the world 's "" deep concerns about the election "" but added it was "" not productive , given the history of US - Iranian ­relations , to be seen as meddling "" .
Observers attributed today 's relative quiet in part to the millions of people watching the World Cup qualifying match between Iran and South Korea .
Six Iranian players , including the captain , wore the green wristbands that have become the symbol of the Mousavi campaign .
The images of defiance from Seoul were seen live across Iran but the armbands had ­disappeared by the second half .
Overall , some 500 people have been arrested since last Friday .
Those reported detained included journalist Saeed Laylaz and Muhammad Atrianfar , a commentator who is close to Mousavi .
The ISNA news agency said 88 people were arrested in the northeastern city of Mashhad and up to 60 in Tabriz .
The politics of the crisis remain complex .
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader , has rejected calls for the election to be annulled , but in one concession to the Mousavi camp , the guardian council , a supervisory body of senior clerics , is to hold a partial recount of the vote , though details of how that will be carried out are sketchy .
It is also far from clear whether its findings will have any effect , especially if it concludes that Ahmadinejad won , albeit by a lesser margin .
According to the official results he had 63 % of the vote to Mousavi 's 34 % . ""
The recount will not satiate popular anger , "" said Ali Ansari , an Iran expert at St Andrews University .
"" There is every possibility that this will all get worse before it gets better . ""
I do n't think it will have a speedy conclusion . ""
But he added : "" Those who are participating in the protests are looking for a change in the system but not the overthrow of the system .
This is a crisis of authority , not legitimacy .
The demonstrastions reflect a deep malaise in society .
It 's not just about the elections . """
2009-06-17,"At least 500 activists , opposition figures , journalists and students have been arrested in Iran in recent days in a growing crackdown aimed at "" decapitating "" the movement against Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's re - election .
The round - up has included individuals once closely associated with the 1979 Islamic revolution but who have been critical of Ahmadinejad 's government .
Saeed Leylaz , a prominent journalist and commentator , today became the latest leading figure to be arrested , possibly because of his frequent interviews with foreign media .
Leylaz , a known reformist and supporter of the defeated candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi , warned last week that Iran faced a possible Tiananmen Square - type bloodbath if the election was stolen .
Also in custody was Oxford university PhD student Mohammadreza Jalaipour , the son of a Tehran University sociology lecturer and prominent reformist .
He was arrested trying to board a flight to London this morning .
The detentions came as human rights groups voiced concern for the health of another activist , Saeed Hajarian , who was arrested yesterday .
Hajarian – a one - time adviser to the reformist former president , Mohammad Khatami – needs constant medical attention for brain and spinal injuries sustained in a failed assassination attempt nine years ago .
He is said to be in constant pain and undergoes regular consultations with neurologists .
Two other prominent reformists , Mohammad Ali Abtahi and Behzad Nabavi , and a well - known human rights lawyer , Abdolfattah Soltani – who has defended many student activists – were also rounded up on Tuesday .
Their detentions followed those of an estimated 120 activists and journalists who were arrested in Tehran last weekend , including Mohammad Reza Khatami – brother of the former president – who was later released .
The wave of detentions has spread beyond the capital to include provincial cities .
At least 100 civic figures are understood to have been arrested in Tabriz , a city historically renowned for political protest and where Mousavi has strong support .
Those targeted included at least seven leading members of the Iran Freedom Movement , one of the country 's oldest political parties .
The movement 's leader , Ebrahim Yazdi , a former foreign minister and adviser to the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , was arrested today at Pars Hospital in Tehran , according to his party 's website .
Eight members of the Tabriz branch of the Islamic participation front – a reformist organisation linked to Khatami – were also arrested .
Another four activists in Qazvin province , north of Tehran , were said by human rights campaigners to have "" disappeared "" while members of the Tahkim - e Vahdat , an influential students organisation supporting the other reformist candidate Mehdi Karroubi , have been "" systematically targeted "" . ""
Iranian intelligence and security forces are using the public protests to engage in what appears to be a major purge of reform - oriented individuals whose situations in detention could be life - threatening , "" said Aaron Rhodes , a spokesman for the international campaign for human rights in Iran .
The detention of prominent people has added to multiple arrests of students at Iran 's universities .
An estimated 200 were arrested after clashes at Tehran University at the weekend , although many were later released .
More than 100 were taken into custody on Monday after security forces fired teargas at protesters at Shiraz University ."
2009-06-17,"' They have elected a ­Labour government , "" a Savoy diner famously declared on the night of Britain 's election landslide in 1945 . ""
The country will never stand for it . ""
From the evidence so far coming out of Iran , something similar seems to be ­happening on the streets of Tehran – and in the western capitals just as desperate to see the back of Iranian president ­Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Of course the movement behind opposition candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi spreads far beyond the capital 's elite , as did the supporters of Winston Churchill against Clement Attlee .
In Iran , it includes large sections of the middle class , students and the secular .
But a similar misreading of their own social circles for the country at large appears to have convinced the opposition 's supporters that it can only have lost last Friday 's election through fraud .
That is also reflected in the western media , whose cameras focus so lovingly on Tehran 's gilded youth and for whom Ahmadinejad is nothing but a Holocaust - denying fanatic .
The other Ahmadinejad , who is seen to stand up for the country 's independence , expose elite corruption on TV and use Iran 's oil wealth to boost the incomes of the poor majority , is largely invisible abroad .
While Mousavi promised market reforms and privatisation , more personal freedom and better relations with the west , the president increased pensions and public sector wages and handed out cheap loans .
So it 's hardly surprising that Ahmadinejad should have a solid base among the working class , the religious , small town and rural poor – or that he might have achieved a similar majority to that of his first election in 2005 .
That 's what one of the few genuinely independent polls ( the US - based Ballen - Doherty survey ) predicted last month , when the Times reported Ahmadinejad was "" expected to win "" .
But such details have got lost as the pressure has built in Tehran for a "" green revolution "" amid unsubstantiated claims that the election was stolen .
The strongest evidence appears to be some surprising regional results and the speed of the official announcement , triggered by Mousavi 's declaration that he was the winner before the polls closed .
But most official figures do n't look so ­implausible –
Mousavi won Tehran , for instance , by 2.2 m votes to 1.8 m – and it 's hard to believe that rigging alone could account for the 11 million - vote gap between the main contenders .
If Ahmadinejad was in fact the winner , then there is an attempted coup going on in Tehran right now , and it is being led by Mousavi and his western - backed supporters .
But for the demonstrators facing repression in Tehran , the conviction that they have been cheated has created its own momentum in what is now a highly polarised society .
That is given more force by the fact that the protests are underpinned by a split in the theocratic regime , of which Mousavi and his allies are a powerful component .
Part of that is about a perceived threat to their own economic interests .
But the division also reflects differences within the establishment about how to respond to Barack Obama and the overtures from Washington .
All factions uphold Iran 's right to continue nuclear reprocessing , but Mousavi 's campaign was critical of the level of support given to Hezbollah and Hamas , while Ahmadinejad 's supporters argue that only toughness can win western acceptance of Iran 's status as a new regional power .
Iran is of course at the centre of an arc of crisis across the greater Middle East , from Palestine to Pakistan : the legacy of the Bush administration 's catastrophic failure in Iraq and the wider war on terror .
And as the US attempts to reconstitute its hegemony in the region on a new basis – for which Obama 's speech to the Muslim world in Cairo was supposed to set the tone – there 's reason to believe that the birth pangs of the new order may yet turn out to be as painful as the death throes of the old .
Last Friday , even before the polls had closed in Iran , the US president ­commented that people were ­""looking at new possibilities "" in Iran , just as they had in Lebanon 's elections the previous weekend .
In fact , the unexpected defeat of Hezbollah 's opposition coalition ( which nevertheless won the largest number of votes ) seems to have had more to do with local Lebanese sectarian issues and large - scale vote buying than the Obama effect .
But the implications of his remarks were not lost in Iran , where the US is still spending hundreds of millions of dollars in covert destabilisation programmes .
Obama 's public engagement over the Israel - Palestine conflict has so far elicited a commitment by Israel 's Benjamin Netanyahu to the paper ­principle of a Palestinian state – backed by both his predecessors and George Bush and hedged around with so many restrictions it would barely merit Ruritanian status – but no climbdown over illegal settlement expansion .
The chances of a negotiated deal in such conditions seem minimal , particularly in the absence of Hamas , and the prospects that a US plan for a settlement might then fail and plunge the region back into conflict relatively high .
Meanwhile , ­resistance and wider violence have been growing again in Iraq , as US occupation troops pull back from the cities .
And in Afghanistan , far from ­winding down the occupation , Obama is ­escalating the conflict as promised , with another 21,000 US troops being sent this ­summer to fight the ­unwinnable war , as attacks on Nato forces have reached an all - time peak .
At the same time , the spread of the Afghan war into ­neighbouring Pakistan has left thousands of civilians dead , created more than two million refugees and led to a civilian carnage from US drone attacks across the northwest of the country .
In case anyone imagined such wars of western occupation would become a thing of the past in the wake of the ­discredited Bush administration , ­General Dannatt , head of the ­British army , recently set out to disabuse them .
Echoing US defence secretary Robert Gates , he insisted : "" Iraq and ­Afghanistan are not aberrations – they are signposts for the future "" .
In such a context , the neutralisation of Iran as an independent regional power would be a huge prize for the US – defanging recalcitrants from Baghdad to Beirut – and a route out of the strategic impasse created by the invasion of Iraq .
But so far , the signs from Tehran are still that that 's unlikely to be achieved by a colour - coded revolution ."
2009-06-17,"Iran 's government sought today to decapitate the opposition movement by rounding up ­hundreds of activists , journalists and intellectuals .
A total of 500 were reported to have been detained across the country , including well - known political figures from the 1979 Islamic revolution .
The mass detentions combined with paramilitary raids on university campuses appeared to be part of a determined and sustained backlash on the part of a government that initially appeared to have been taken by surprise by the scale of the protests after the declaration that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had won Friday 's presidential poll .
The authorities also launched what appeared to be a concerted campaign to link the protests with foreign intervention , calling in the Swiss ambassador , who looks after US interests in Iran , and the British ambassador to complain about what Tehran called "" intolerable "" meddling in Iran 's internal affairs .
Ebrahim Yazdi , a former foreign minister and aide to the father of the revolution , Ayatollah Khomeini , was arrested at the Tehran hospital where he was undergoing medical tests , according to the website of his Freedom party .
Seven other members of the party were also detained .
With the exception of Yazdi , the arrests appeared to bypass political leaders and focus on their lieutenants .
Muhammad Tavassali , Tehran 's mayor in the years after the Islamic revolution and leading member of the Kargozaran party was arrested .
Tavassali is close to the former president , Hashemi Rafsanjani , who is the most powerful opposition within the inner circles of the clerical hierarchy .
The arrest was widely seen as a warning shot aimed at Rafsanjani .
Another former revolutionary stalwart , Behzad Nabavi , who negotiated with the US during the 1979 - 81 Tehran embassy hostage crisis , also appeared on the list of detainees .
"" Iranian intelligence and security forces are using the public protests to engage in what appears to be a major purge of reform - oriented individuals whose situations in detention could be life - threatening , "" said Aaron Rhodes , a spokesman for the international campaign for human rights in Iran .
The detention of prominent people has added to multiple arrests of students at Iran 's universities .
An estimated 200 were detained after clashes at Tehran university at the weekend , although many were later released .
More than 100 were taken into custody on Monday after security forces fired teargas at protesters at Shiraz university .
Saeed Leylaz , a prominent economist , journalist and commentator , who had been frequently quoted by the international media during the election , was one of the better - known names swept up in the mass arrests yesterday .
Leylaz , a known reformist and supporter of the leading opposition candidate , Mir Hossein Mousavi , warned last week that Iran faced a possible Tiananmen Square - type bloodbath if the election was stolen .
Mohammad Atrianfar , a well - known editor of a succession of liberal newspapers was also reported to have been picked up .
The press rights organisation , Reporters Without Borders , said 11 Iranian journalists had been detained since June 12 , and five remained in detention yesterday .
Another 10 had disappeared , either because they had been picked up or they had gone into hiding .
The organisation said security service agents have moved into newspaper offices where they have been vetting articles and censoring content .
Four pro - reform newspapers have been closed down , including Kalameh Sabaz , owned by Mousavi .
It has not been allowed to publish since June 13 .
Foreign reporters have had their press accreditation revoked and media restrictions have made it illegal to report first hand on the protests .
The digital media have also been increasingly targeted since it became clear they were being used as an organising tool by the demonstrators and a means to sidestep the media restrictions .
The Revolutionary Guard , a powerful force that answers directly to the supreme leader , made its first public statement since the elections yesterday , threatening bloggers and online news sites .
The statement , on the government news service said its investigators had already taken action against "" deviant news sites "" that encouraged public disturbances .
The statement said the targeted sites were backed by Canadian , US and British interests , and called on all online publishers to remove content that was deemed to "" create tension "" .
"" Legal action will be very strong and call on them to remove such materials , "" it said .
The wave of detentions has spread beyond the capital to include provincial cities .
At least 100 civic figures are understood to have been arrested in Tabriz , where Mousavi has strong support .
Amnesty International reported that the detainees included 17 political activists , who had been "" taken to unspecified locations on Monday night after they staged a peaceful protest in the city 's Abresan Square "" .
The Tabriz detainees included Freedom Movement activists and eight members of the Islamic Participation Front , a reformist organisation linked to Khatami , were also arrested .
In Shiraz , in the south of the country , Amnesty cited reports said that a hundred students had been detained after security forces used teargas to storm the university library .
In the central province of Isfahan , a senior prosecutor warned that dissidents could face execution under Islamic law .
"" We warn the few elements controlled by foreigners who try to disrupt domestic security by inciting individuals to destroy and to commit arson that the Islamic penal code for such individuals waging war against God is execution , "" Habibi said , according to the Fars news agency .
Another four activists in Qazvin province , north of Tehran , were said by human rights campaigners to have "" disappeared "" while members of the Tahkim - e Vahdat , an influential students organisation supporting the other reformist candidate Mehdi Karoubi , had been "" systematically targeted "" .
Human rights groups voiced concern over the health of a political activist , Saeed Hajarian , who was arrested yesterday .
Hajarian , once an adviser to President Mohammad Khatami , needs constant medical attention for brain and spinal injuries sustained in a failed assassination attempt nine years ago .
Mohammadreza Jalaeipour , the son of a prominent Tehran academic and a Mousavi supporter was also reported to have been arrested as he was boarding a flight to London this morning .
Abdolfattah Soltani , a human rights lawyer who has defended many student activists , was picked up on Tuesday .
The new arrests follow an estimated 120 activists and journalists picked up in a first wave in Tehran over the weekend , including Mohammad Reza Khatami , brother of the former president , who was later released .
Two other prominent reformists , Mohammad Ali Abtahi and Behzad Nabavi , and a well - known human rights lawyer , were picked up in the same sweep .

2009-06-18,"When it was uttered it was meant as a ­biting put - down to the thousands who dared to question his re - election as president of Iran . ""
The nation 's huge river would not leave any opportunity for the expression of dirt and dust , "" said Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in a rather elliptical reference to the surging protests on the streets of Tehran .
For good measure he followed up with some more earthy language comparing claims of massive election fraud in last week 's poll to the passions of supporters of a beaten football team after a match .
He then went on to accuse his opponents of "" officially recognising thieves , homosexuals and scumbags "" in exchange for their votes .
But , just as street protests the world over seize upon a poignant image to convey their message , so Ahmadinejad 's contemptuous phrase "" dirt and dust "" has entered folklore and provided a focus for the rage of the protesters .
So far it has inspired pithy slogans , blog headlines , posters and a litany of insults throwing the president 's words back in his face .
"" Dirt and dust is you , it is you who are the enemy of Iran , "" one chant goes .
Another frequently - heard slogan has been : "" We are not dirt and dust , we are Iran 's nation . ""
The phrase ( khas o khashak in Farsi ) has become a badge of pride .
Etemad - e Melli , a reformist newspaper , carried a huge picture on yesterday 's front page showing marchers carrying a banner bearing the slogan , Epic of Dirt and Dust .
The offending words were written in green , the colour adopted by Mousavi 's campaign .
It has also prompted a high - profile protest from one of Iran 's most famous singers , Mohammad Reza Shajarian , who asked the state broadcaster IRIB – controlled by Ahmadinejad supporters – to stop playing his songs because he believed the insulting reference included him .
"" I emphatically ask IRIB not to broadcast my voice because this is the voice of dirt and dust and will always remain so , "" he told BBC Persian .
Yesterday another huge crowd – estimated to be hundreds of thousands strong – rallied , this time in Southern Tehran , to protest against the killing of marchers in previous days .
Today Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , will give what is being seen as a critical address at Friday prayers that will be scrutinised for clues as to how the Islamic regime plans to deal with the massive unrest in the country .
Besides the chants , the protests have become defined by instantly recognisable green emblems – including green wristbands and ribbons wrapped round the fingers .
Many protesters have also appeared in T - shirts and headbands bearing the slogan : "" Where is my vote ? ""
At least one other famous Ahmadinejad quote has also been used against him during the demonstrations .
One green - clad pro - Mousavi protester was photographed wearing a mock halo around his head ; a gesture apparently aimed at Ahmadinejad 's claims , made to a conservative cleric , to have been engulfed by a halo of light while addressing the UN general assembly four years ago .
In a potentially ominous sign for Ahmadinejad , even senior fundamentalists appear to have been alienated by the "" dirt and dust "" putdown .
Ahmad Tavakoli , the conservative director of the research centre of Iran 's parliament , said it would be more appropriately applied to the plainclothes security forces who have brutally attacked protesting students at Tehran university and other institutions in recent days .
"" We have to accept that 14 million have not voted for Mr Ahmadinejad and , rightly or wrongly , they now have a question and feel insulted , "" he told IRIB 's Channel Five .
"" They are neither dirt and dust nor hooligans and thugs .
Dirt and dust are those who attack university campuses and students and commit crimes there . """
2009-06-18,"Iran 's rulers today extended a cautious overture to candidates defeated in disputed presidential elections , but the move did little to stop demonstrators amassing on the streets of Tehran for a sixth straight day of protests .
The powerful guardian council said it would convene an extraordinary session on Saturday to hear allegations of vote - rigging from the opposition candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi and two other also - rans in last Friday 's elections who were , according to official results , defeated by the incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
However the gesture had no impact on the momentum of opposition protests , which have overrun the streets of the capital this week .
This afternoon , Mousavi re - emerged to lead another massive manifestation by tens of thousands – or perhaps hundreds of thousands – of people ,
many dressed in black and carrying candles that they lit as night fell to commemorate those killed in a week of confrontation .
Supporters shouted "" Ya Hossein , Mir Hossein , "" as he proceeded to a central Tehran square .
Police helicopters whirred overhead ; some in the crowd showed them the victory sign .
Mousavi delivered a brief speech through a loudspeaker in which he called for calm and urged people to persist with their silent protests .
Some held images of the victims .
Green wristbands had been replaced by black ones .
The protests are the biggest since the Islamic revolution in 1979 and have unsettled the regime .
Ahmadinejad was declared the election victor hours after the poll closed last Friday , with nearly 63 % of the vote against 34 % for his closest rival , Mousavi .
Attention will switch tomorrow to an address at Friday prayers by Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , which may amount to the biggest moment so far for the regime .
Khamenei has called for unity and calm .
But the opposition has been enraged by the sporadic violence meted out by paramilitary units , as well as by scores of arrests of prominent opposition and reformist figures .
One leading figure arrested was Ebrahim Yazdi , an ailing reformist who was seized as he underwent tests in Tehran hospital .
Yazdi , the Islamic republic 's first post-1979 foreign minister , was taken to Evin prison yesterday , but today was returned to the hospital .
Others reported to have been detained include the journalist Saeed Laylaz , and Muhammad Atrianfar , a commentator close to Mousavi .
The ISNA news agency said 88 people were arrested in the north - eastern city of Mashhad , and up to 60 in Tabriz .
The government has also sought to disrupt the flow of information about the protests , banning journalists from covering demonstrations , threatening bloggers and trying to block websites such as Twitter and Facebook that have been a vital tool for the opposition movement .
Mousavi has sent a letter of protest to Iran 's state national security council complaining of plainclothes agents using sticks , metal rods and firearms to "" attack the lines of peaceful participants before the arrival of the security forces "" .
He condemned the arrests of his allies in the past few days .
Pro -
Mousavi protests have also been reported in the cities of Isfahan , Rasht , Orumiyeh , Zanjan and Zahedan .
Few appear to have been assuaged by vague regime promises of a partial recount , nor by the promise of a guardian council session on the election on Saturday .
"" The recount will not satiate popular anger , "" said Ali Ansari , an Iran expert at St Andrews University .
"" There is every possibility that this will all get worse before it gets better .
I do n't think it will have a speedy conclusion .
"" Those who are participating in the protests are looking for a change in the system but not the overthrow of the system .
This is a crisis of authority , not legitimacy .
The demonstrations reflect a deep malaise in society .
It 's not just about the elections . """
2009-06-18,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's taste for contemptuous putdowns has rebounded against him and energised his opponents after he dismissed those protesting against his re - election as "" dirt and dust "" .
The description has entered the folklore of street demonstrations against the official outcome of last Friday 's poll and inspired at least two pithy slogans throwing the president 's words back in his face . ""
Dirt and dust is you , it is you who are the enemy of Iran , "" one chant goes .
Another frequently heard slogan is : "" We are not dirt and dust , we are Iran 's nation . ""
Ahmadinejad 's belittling description was made at a victory rally in Tehran 's Valiasr Square on Sunday , when he declared that his re - election had been legitimised by the participation of 40 million voters . ""
The nation 's huge river would not leave any opportunity for the expression of dirt and dust , "" he added .
He also compared the claims of massive fraud to the passions of supporters of a beaten team after a football match and accused his election opponents of "" officially recognising thieves , homosexuals and scumbags "" in exchange for their votes .
The following day , a crowd estimated by Tehran 's mayor , Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf , to be as many as three million - strong , marched to the city 's Azadi Square protesting that the election was stolen .
The phrase "" dirt and dust "" ( khas o khashak in Farsi ) has now become a badge of pride among the supporters of the defeated reformists , Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi .
Besides the chants , the demonstrations have become defined by instantly recognisable green emblems – including wristbands and ribbons wrapped round the fingers .
Many protesters have also appeared in T - shirts and headbands bearing the slogan : "" Where is my vote ? ""
Etemad - e Melli newspaper , owned by Karroubi , carried a massive picture on today 's front page showing marchers carrying a banner bearing the slogan , Epic of Dirt and Dust .
The offending words were written in green .
The description has also been widely referred to in numerous blogs , with some displaying it as a headline .
It also prompted a high - profile protest from one of Iran 's most famous singers , Mohammad Reza Shajarian , who asked the state broadcaster IRIB – controlled by Ahmadinejad supporters – to stop playing his songs because he believed the insulting reference included him .
"" I emphatically ask IRIB not to broadcast my voice because this is the voice of dirt and dust and will always remain so , "" he told BBC Persian .
Even senior fundamentalists appear to have been alienated by the putdown .
Ahmad Tavakoli , the conservative director of the research centre of Iran 's parliament , said it was more appropriate to plain - clothes security forces who had attacked protesting students at Tehran university and other institutions in recent days .
"" We have to accept that 14 million have not voted for Mr Ahmadinejad and , rightly or wrongly , they now have a question and feel insulted , "" he told IRIB 's Channel Five .
"" They are neither dirt and dust nor hooligans and thugs .
Dirt and dust are those who attack university campuses and students and commit crimes there . ""
Maryam Behrouzi – secretary of the Zeinab society , a pro - fundamentalist women 's group – condemned Ahmadinejad for using "" provocative rhetoric "" .
"" All people deserve respect , even those who reject the result , and nobody should call them dirt and dust , "" she told the news agency ILNA .
These three words are not the only Ahmadinejad quote to have been used against him during the demonstrations .
One green - clad pro - Mousavi protester was photographed wearing a mock yellow halo around his head ; the gesture was apparently aimed at Ahmadinejad claims , made to a conservative cleric , to have been engulfed by a halo of light while addressing the UN general assembly four years ago ."
2009-06-18,"In the summer of 2005 , I covered the Iranian presidential race that resulted in Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's first , surprising , electoral victory .
My mandate was not to report on the campaign , but to write about young people 's attitude to politics there .
I spent three weeks talking to student leaders and members of the Basij ( an all - volunteer , quasi - legal militia ) , to exhausted waiters and urban hipsters .
Most were either busy looking for a second job , or too exhausted from the several they already held , to care much about politics .
Those who did not face cash problems spent their time flitting through galleries and buying ecstasy at pomegranate juice stands .
On the whole , I found that young people , pious and secular alike , were profoundly alienated from politics .
They seemed more concerned with their immediate personal freedoms than in risking anything for political change .
Four years on , however , young Iranians have sloughed off that apathy and headed into the streets in their thousands , to wage passionate protest against an election they consider fraudulent .
Young people who did not even bother to vote in 2005 are braving serious reprisals to support Mir Hossein Mousavi , the man they believe should have won power ; Facebook martyrs co - opting the regime 's own ideology of martyrdom to incite even greater fury and protest .
So what has changed in Iran to bring about this remarkable shift ?
The answer lies partly in Ahmadinejad 's tenure as president , an era that has raised the misery quotient of most Iranians , regardless of class , age or ethnic background .
But the scale of the protests being held across Iran today also suggests a despair that is more deep - rooted than simply outrage over what they see as a stolen election .
In my view , it also reflects a fundamental antipathy toward a revolutionary regime that Iranians have grown to consider unaccountable , indifferent to the rule of law , corrupt and incapable of meeting its people 's basic needs .
I moved to Iran in the summer of 2005 to work as a reporter and start a family .
I found life there difficult but bearable : the economy was poor , but buoyed by soaring oil prices ; traffic and pollution were stifling , but you could hold hands in the street or have coffee with a friend of the opposite gender without risking arrest .
Book stores stocked copies of the latest western bestsellers , and magazines and literary journals flourished .
The authorities permitted the occasional rock concert , and tolerated young women 's flouting of Islamic dress codes .
Even the murals of scowling ayatollahs had been repainted with cordial smiles .
Iranians still wanted much more , but you if asked them if things were better than in the past , most would have said yes .
Ahmadinejad 's reputation as a religious ideologue prompted worries that he would enforce social strictures with renewed vigour .
But a crackdown never materialised .
He declared that Iranians had more important things to worry about than hijab , or Islamic dress , and Iran 's 48 million or so people under the age of 30 concluded that the permissiveness which they had come to take for granted would continue .
By the end of 2005 , Ahmadinejad had begun to use the escalating standoff with the west over Iran 's nuclear programme as a way of broadening his appeal at home .
He cast the west as an enemy , bent on bullying and weakening Iran by denying it legitimate access to technology .
Iranians angered by President George Bush 's cowboy rhetoric were thrilled , and their mood , stoked by Ahmadinejad 's nationalist talk , grew increasingly assertive .
By the spring of 2006 , he had transformed himself into a national hero .
His slogan "" nuclear power is our absolute right "" slipped off the tongues of even westernised , secular Iranians .
I could n't attend a dinner party that spring without people gushing about their magnificent president .
When he reversed a ban on women attending football games , a relative of mine compared him to Reza Shah , Iran 's great 20th - century nation - builder .
Caught up in the nationalist spirit of the president 's nuclear rhetoric , convinced that Iran was regaining its prestige and influence in the world , most Iranians were unprepared for what came next .
First , the economy unravelled .
Thanks to Ahmadinejad 's expansionary fiscal policies , inflation spiked by at least 20 % and later went even higher .
Though I was paid in US dollars , I began to find it too expensive to buy large amounts of fruit ; my babysitter 's family stopped eating red meat regularly , while one friend stopped buying the imported baby formula that helped her son 's colic .
House prices in Tehran surged by 200 % , and thousands of couples saving up to get married found themselves priced out of the institution altogether .
The economic downturn began turning people against the president , but his fate was sealed when he reintroduced the molesting social controls that Iranians considered ancient history .
In the summer of 2007 , authorities raided neighbourhoods all over Tehran to confiscate illegal satellite dishes .
The police swooped down on our building early one morning , kicking down the devices .
My six - year - old nephew wept at the loss of his cartoon channel , and looked on with confusion as the police confiscated our neighbour 's mobile phone , with which he had been recording footage of the police trucks full of spindly dishes .
Late that summer , authorities launched a full - scale campaign of intimidation against young people they accused of un - Islamic appearance .
Within a few short weeks , police detained 150,000 people , and all the women in my life went out to buy the shapeless , long coats that we had worn back in the late 1990s .
Though the campaign targeted young men as well , authorities singled out women with particular brutality .
The government 's disdain for women increased by the day .
Though Iranians fretted about the impact of western sanctions , the government turned its attention to a bill that would facilitate polygamy .
Soon after , it announced a plan that would supposedly solve Iran 's marriage crisis .
It called the scheme "" semi - independent marriage "" , and it amounted to a hollow version of the institution that would secure men legal and piously sanctioned sex , while denying women the security and social respectability of conventional marriage .
On internet news sites and newspapers , women reacted scathingly .
A girlfriend of mine , whose English classes had recently been segregated by gender , complained the government was imposing seventh - century rules on modern women .
To add to Iranians ' frustration , interminable queues accompanied the government 's petrol - rationing scheme , unveiled that summer .
In the evenings it could take several hours to fill our car , and when our local petrol station was torched by rioters furious with the new plan , we stopped using the car .
Iran 's streets began to remind me of postwar Baghdad .
Censorship had been stepped up such that seventh editions of sociology textbooks were not receiving permits to reprint .
The ominous white morality police vans that patrolled the streets kept young people in a permanent state of anxiety .
One morning , while taking my baby for a stroll near the mountains , a teenage policewoman grabbed by arm and tried to lead me to a police van . ""
Your sleeves are too short , "" she barked , indifferent to the disgusted looks of other families nearby .
Even our local produce seller , a deeply pious man with a gentle wife who wears a chador ( an open cloak that covers the head and body ) , could not contain his fury at Ahmadinejad . ""
He 's ruined this country , "" he said , storming around piles of tomatoes and figs .
"" Why does n't someone stop him ? ""
My family left Iran in 2007 , but on successive return visits I found the mood sliding into greater despair .
Young relatives who had been determined to stick out life in Iran were talking about emigrating .
Older friends whose spirit had lightened during the more moderate eight years of President Mohammad Khatami now had anguish etched on their faces .
When I spent a month in Iran earlier this year , I found people ambivalent about voting in the June election , but also determined that somehow Ahmadinejad 's reign must end .
A girlfriend had lost her teaching job for failing a "" can - you - pray - properly ? ""
exam .
One relative was threatened with losing her job if she did n't show up to the collective prayer sessions held at the ministry where she worked .
Most people I knew could not quite absorb how the small freedoms they had grown accustomed to , the patches of openness they had taken for granted , had been snatched away .
Even before the advent of Ahmadinejad , Iran suffered from one of the world 's most sizeable brain drains .
Each year , the country 's brightest and most talented young people left to work in the west , energising and enriching the technology , medical , and aeronautical sectors of other nations .
They left because young people in Iran can not find jobs suitable to their educations , and most believe that Iran reserves prosperity for the scions of ayatollahs .
Even young people without the qualifications desired by immigration officials consider Iran a land barren of opportunity , and have preferred to struggle in the west .
This trend began long before Ahmadinejad 's presidency , and it has served to tear apart Iranian families for three decades .
If the tremendous diversity of the faces seen protesting in Iran this week underscores anything , it is that people 's grievances have deep roots in Iran , and that their anger has been spurred , but not conceived , by this electoral outrage .
Today , Iranians are registering their discontent with the system of Islamic government as a whole .
They do not necessarily want to overthrow their regime , but to express the depths of their frustration with its inadequacy .
Of all the images I 've seen emerging from Iran this week , those of fiery women beating policemen and leading protests have moved me the most .
Throughout the past decade , Iran 's extraordinarily sophisticated and well - educated women have sought for peaceful change through the existing system .
Accounting for 60 % of university students , Iranian women emerge from university armed with career expectations and modern attitudes toward their role in family and society .
They have patiently petitioned the state to grant them more equitable rights before the law .
But at each opportunity , they have been treated with contempt .
Their vibrant presence in these protests is signalling to the government that they will not tolerate its discrimination and disdain any longer .
In 2001 , I recall attending a football rally in western Tehran where young people flirted with political protest .
Riot police quickly emerged from the shadows to beat protesters with batons .
A girlfriend and I were among those beaten , and walked home along the city 's riotous thoroughfares comparing our bruises , and wondering whether the newspapers would report what had happened the next day .
When they did n't , I took pictures of my bruises and emailed them to friends .
The world seems astonished by how quickly young Iranians have commandeered the internet to spread news of their protests .
The truth is , they 've had a decade of quiet practice .

2009-06-19,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad spoke out for the first time in three days yesterday to emphasise national unity and qualify earlier comments in which he compared Iranians protesting about the "" theft "" of the election to football fans whose team had lost .
The president 's television appearance was his first since he was seen in Russia on Monday .
He also attended a cabinet meeting and defended the legitimacy of the contested vote . ""
The ideals of the Islamic Revolution were the winners , "" he said , adding that 25 million out of 40 million voters had approved his conduct .
Ahmadinejad 's last public appearance in Tehran had been on Sunday , when he compared supporters of the defeated candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi to disgruntled football fans .
He then addressed a crowd of tens of thousands in the centre of the capital .
But last night he struck an uncharacteristically conciliatory note : "" I meant those who riot , those who set fire [ to buildings ] and attack people ...
I said those individuals ... are aliens to our nation .
I stressed that this election victory belonged to 70 m Iranians and the 40 m who took part in voting .
Everyone is a winner .
Iranians are very much valued and respected , and the cabinet belongs to all Iranians "" .
Arshin Adib - Moghaddam , of London University 's School of Oriental and African Studies , said he had expected Ahmadinejad to be more visible this week .
"" It would make sense to present himself as the president of all Iranians .
But he appears detached from reality .
The way he reacted has seriously damaged his position . ""
The incumbent was officially declared to have won last Friday 's presidential election by 63 % to 34 % , though a partial recount is under way , with the revised results due in just over a week .
At a summit in Russia on Monday , he was greeted by heads of state as the "" newly re - elected president of Iran . """
2009-06-19,"Iran 's opposition faces a critical test of resolve and the country an uncertain future tomorrow after the Islamic regime 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , issued a blunt warning to those involved in mass protests over last week 's "" stolen "" presidential election that they would "" bear the responsibility "" for any bloodshed .
Khamenei rejected accusations of fraud in the poll , confirmed the incumbent , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , as the winner , and gave no ground to the millions of ­Iranians demanding their votes back .
Mir Hossein Mousavi , who claims he beat Ahmadinejad in the race , was said by an ally to have no plans for unauthorised rallies tomorrow following the warning , but supporters vowed to go on protesting .
Fears grew tonight of an intensifying crackdown on media and opposition activists .
Students at the fine arts faculty of Tehran University – where scores of students were injured and some reported killed after raids by security forces earlier this week – announced an indefinite sit - in starting tomorrow .
Khamenei 's closely watched speech at prayers at Tehran University could hardly have been tougher .
It had been hoped he might adopt a more conciliatory tone that would help defuse the gathering crisis , the worst in Iran 's 30-year post - revolutionary history .
But he warned : "" If there is any bloodshed , the leaders of the protests will be held directly responsible .
The result of the election comes from the ballot box , not from the street .
Today the Iranian nation needs calm .
"" Tens of thousands of worshippers cheered as he told them : "" It is your victory .
They can not manipulate it . ""
Mousavi , a moderate former prime minister whose "" green "" movement scared the regime with the support it was attracting , ignored a call to attend the prayer meeting and now faces a dilemma over his next step .
Ignoring Khamenei 's message risks bloodshed on a far larger scale than the eight people killed last week .
Accepting it means surrender to the regime .
The reformist cleric Mehdi Karroubi , another candidate for the presidency , added to the pressure tonight by also calling for the election to be annulled .
"" Accept the Iranian nation 's will by cancelling the vote and guarantee the establishment 's survival , "" he urged .
Khamenei attacked opponents at home but also lambasted Iran 's enemies abroad in hardline remarks that bode ill for any opening to the US , where Barack Obama is seeking talks to tackle worries over Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
Britain was attacked as "" the most evil "" , but the US , Israel and "" Zionist - controlled "" media were also abused , as was Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state . ""
The enemies are targeting the Islamic establishment 's legitimacy by questioning the election and its authenticity before and after [ the vote ] , "" said Khamenei .
President Barack Obama toughened his rhetoric yesterday in support of the demonstrators and criticised the Tehran government for its violent response .
"" I 'm very concerned – based on some of the tenor and tone of the statements that have been made – that the government of Iran recognise that the world is watching , "" Obama told CBS News . ""
And how they approach and deal with people who are , through peaceful means , trying to be heard will , I think , send a pretty clear signal to the international community about what Iran is – and is not . ""
Analysts and commentators were dismayed by the implications of Khamenei 's speech .
Sadegh Saba , chief analyst for BBC Persian TV , said : "" Mousavi wants the protests to continue but Khamenei is saying if they do there might be bloodshed – and it will be on your hands . ""
Issa Saharkhiz , a Tehran - based pro - reformist commentator , said Khamenei 's speech had transformed the crisis from a conflict over the election result into a trial of his own political authority , which was now being openly questioned . ""
Now the issue is that the supreme leader 's sense of justice , management and competence is under question , "" he told Deutsche Welle .
"" The leadership can not be left in the hands of such a person , who for the sake of preserving himself and his power threatens people with mass murder . ""
Crucially , Khamenei ruled out any cheating in the election , apparently dashing hopes that a partial recount ordered by the guardian council , a supervisory body of senior clerics , will mitigate the crisis .
Khamenei 's call for Mousavi and Karroubi to confine their protests to legal avenues prompted mockery . ""
This means that Imam Hossein [ the third most revered figure in Shia Islam ] , instead of making a last stand at Karbala , [ should have ] pursued his grievances through the legal process , "" one blogger said on the Farsi blogsite Balatarin .
Balatarin was flooded with messages voicing outrage at Khamenei 's warning .
One read : "" Mr Khamenei , the direct responsibility for any damage to people 's lives or property now lies with you . """
2009-06-21,"A deadly crackdown on opposition demonstrators appeared tonight to have punctured the most serious protest movement in Iran since the 1979 revolution , as an eerie quiet settled on Tehran and the regime turned its attention to more familiar enemies overseas .
Protesters who have shaken the authorities by venting anger en masse at the "" stolen "" elections that returned Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to office spoke of a hiatus , even a despair , settling on the movement after yesterday'sSaturday 's clashes killed at least 10 and wounded scores more .
State television blamed the casualties on clashes between police and "" terrorist groups "" .
Tonight , sporadic gunfire was heard in northern parts of Tehran , yet there was no repeat of the mass protests that have brought hundreds of thousands to the streets of the capital in the last week .
Some opposition figures were still hoping that their figurehead , the defeated presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi , would emerge tomorrow to lead another rally calling for the elections to be annulled .
But Saturday 's crackdown , in which police wielded guns , truncheons , tear gas and water cannon , showed that the state intends to follow through on veiled threats of zero tolerance from the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Mousavi issued an elliptical statement today in which he spoke of a "" turning point "" being "" forged in the history of our nation .
People are asking each other and also me , when among them , what should be done and in which direction we should go , "" he said .
But he stopped short of giving a clear answer .
"" Protesting against lies and fraud [ in the election ] is your [ Iranians ] right , "" the statement said .
"" In your protests , continue to show restraint .
I am expecting the armed forces to avoid irreversible damage , "" he added .
There has been another wave of arrests , with reports today of the detention of five female relatives of Hashemi Rafsanjani , a former president widely seen as the orchestrator of the opposition movement .
Dozens of journalists have also been detained ; yesterday it was reported that Maziar Bahari , a filmmaker and Newsweek correspondent , had been arrested .
The regime also turned its attention to more distant adversaries , with Ahmadinejad blaming the US and Britain for the crisis . ""
Definitely by hasty remarks you will not be placed in the circle of friendship with the Iranian nation , "" he was quoted as saying about the countries in a meeting with clerics and scholars .
"" I advise you to correct your interfering stances . ""
The foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottatki , told foreign diplomats in Tehran today that Iran had faced "" an in - flooding of British intelligence officials ahead of the election "" .
Britain 's foreign secretary , David Miliband , replied : "" I reject categorically the idea that the protesters are manipulated by foreign countries .
"" Germany 's chancellor , Angela Merkel , urged Iran not only to allow peaceful protests but to conduct a recount of votes cast in the election .
"" Germany is on the side of the Iranian people , who want to exercise their rights of freedom of expression and free assembly , "" she said .
France 's foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , called the crackdown a "" brutal repression "" .
Italy 's foreign minister , Franco Frattini , expressed similar sentiments but confirmed that Iran was still invited to discuss Afghanistan and Iraq at a conference in Trieste this week .
Barack Obama did not expand today on earlier comments in which he called on the regime "" to stop all violent and unjust actions against its own people "" .
Those actions took on a new dimension on Saturday as the security forces responded to a directive by Khamenei to enforce official bans on all public protests .
Demonstrators spoke of a surreal atmosphere on the streets , in which the euphoria of solidarity and resistance mingled with adrenalin , smoke and fear .
Amateur video showed the demonstrators pelting police with stones and shouting : "" Death to the dictator . ""
Scores of injured protesters who sought medical treatment were arrested by security forces at hospitals in the capital , the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran claimed .
The organisation said doctors had been ordered to report protest - related injuries to the authorities , and some seriously injured protesters had sought refuge at foreign embassies .
Violence also spread to other cities , including Shiraz , where police were said to have lashed out at members of the public who were not involved in protests .
Mohammad Khatami , a former president and another leader of the reformist camp , spoke out against the repression .
"" The provocative and insulting portrayal of our people – accusing their healthy civil protest to be an act of foreign influence – is an example of the wrong policies that further distance people from our government , "" he said .
"" A massive number of people do not believe the [ election ] results .
Public trust has been damaged and closing the door to civil protests means opening a dangerous path , and God knows where that will lead . """
2009-06-22,"Iran 's supreme leader 's second son , Mojtaba Khamenei , has emerged as one of the driving forces behind the ­government 's crackdown , diplomats and observers said .
Mojtaba is an ally of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the disputed president , and was credited with winning his father 's endorsement for the then Tehran mayor in the 2005 elections , leading to Ahmadinejad 's shock second round victory .
Mojtaba is an austere figure , ­generally seen as more hardline than his father and has become a gatekeeper for access to the beit - e - rahbari , the supreme leader 's home , and the supreme leader himself .
According to some Iran analysts , Khamenei , 70 , is manoeuvring to position his son as his successor .
Formally , the position is supposed to be awarded by the assembly of experts , an elected group of clerics led by the most powerful rival to Khamenei and Ahmadinejad , Hashemi Rafsanjani .
But the first supreme leader , ­Ruhollah Khomeini , had a powerful say on who his successor should be .
Khamenei has been increasingly described in the official media as the "" Ali of our times "" , a reference to Ali , the Shia imam who passed on the position to his son Hassan .
"" There has been a lot of talk lately that this is all about Mojtaba and the succession , "" said Ali Ansari , an Iran analyst at St Andrews University .
"" He may be securing the position for the long term , and protecting it .
The argument is that he is protecting his future . """
2009-06-22,"Iranian security forces yesterday threatened a "" decisive and revolutionary confrontation "" with opposition demonstrators if protests continued against Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who claimed victory in the country 's presidential elections .
The threat from the Revolutionary Guards signalled that the powerful conservative force could intervene directly to end the political crisis .
Protests continued yesterday despite several deaths over the weekend and increasingly violent methods used by the police and the pro - regime Basij paramilitaries .
As Iranian officials and the state media stepped up their allegations of British involvement in the protest movement , the British embassy in Tehran began evacuating the families of members of staff , and the Foreign Office advised against non - essential travel to Iran .
The parliamentary speaker , Ali Larijani , called for a "" revision "" of diplomatic ties with the UK in the light of what he alleged was British meddling , an allegation denied on Sunday by the foreign secretary , David Miliband .
British diplomats warned , however , that a further worsening of the bilateral relationship was likely in the next few days in view of Tehran 's allegations .
The pro - government Fars news agency quoted a former member of a conservative Islamic student movement as saying : "" If Britain continues its blatant intervention and malevolence , Iranian students will close down the British house of spies in Iran , like they did the US house of spies . ""
The European Union , represented by the Czech government , summoned Iran 's chargé d'affaires and "" categorically rejected "" all allegations of interference , and the Italian embassy said it was available to offer humanitarian aid to injured demonstrators .
At least 17 protesters have been killed so far , according to official figures .
A video showing the death of a young female demonstrator , Neda Agha Soltan , who was shot dead by a sniper on Saturday , was widely circulated in Iran and around the world .
The image has helped to instil fear in opposition ranks but some observers predicted that it might also galvanise the wavering protest movement in the weeks ahead as it mourns her death .
Following the bloodshed on Saturday , the turnout for demonstrations yesterday was much smaller than last week .
Only a few hundred protesters gathered in Tehran 's vast Haft - e - Tir Square and they appeared to be outnumbered by riot police firing teargas and Basij militiamen on motorbikes armed with rifles , as helicopters flew overhead .
Gunmen were visible at windows of government buildings around the square , as well as policemen with cameras taking pictures of the demonstrators .
The judiciary has threatened to set up special courts to try dissidents .
The government backlash against the protesters intensified as the regime acknowledged serious problems with the 12 June elections .
The guardian council , a group of 12 conservative clerics tasked with investigating the vote , said that more votes had been cast in 50 electoral districts than there were registered voters .
However , a council spokesman insisted that such "" discrepancies "" would not overturn the president 's election .
Alongside the riot police , the government 's principal weapon against the demonstrators has been the Basij militia , a paramilitary subsidiary of the Revolutionary Guard .
Yesterday the 125,000-strong Revolutionary Guard corps threatened to intervene directly to quash the protests .
A statement on its website said the demonstrators should "" be ready for the decisive and revolutionary confrontation with the IGRC , Basij and other security forces "" .
The intelligence department of the police issued a statement of its own urging Iranians to help police officers identify "" the main elements who have been behind the recent riots "" , while a member of the judiciary said special courts should be set up to try them .
In an attempt to stifle protests before they began yesterday , Haft - e - Tir Square was ringed by police and Basij , who were stopping pedestrians to question them and scrutinise their identity papers .
Any groups of more than three people were stopped on suspicion of joining an illegal protest .
Police could be seen filming from the surrounding rooftops and from cars and motorbikes , in a apparent move to identify protest leaders .
Police armed with rifles could be seen at the windows of government buildings around the square .
However , demonstrators succeeded in gathering on the north side of the square where they chanted Allahu Akbar ( God is Great ) before the police fired teargas .
As the crowd scattered they were sheltered by locals in their homes and offices in a gesture of solidarity .
"" I 'm was badly beaten by the riot police on Saturday , "" said Mostafa , a 25-year - old university graduate .
"" I can still feel the pain but the pain does n't matter – what matters for me is that they got to my spirit .
I 'm here in Haft - e - Tir Square to take my spirit back from this government .
To get back my vote and the blood of whole innocent people who were killed by this government . ""
The police also put on a significant show of force around the university , stopping and questioning students .
A young man was pushed to the ground and hit with batons as he tried to escape .
A young woman was also attacked but her cries for help were ignored by the crowd , which appeared depressed and helpless .
Leili , a 32-year - old artist , said : "" They were thinking that they could stop people claiming their rights after their brutal attack and killing people on Saturday but they are wrong , people will not easily pull back .
"" We are still here although we do n't have anything , not even a newspaper to cover what 's happening , and they have rifles and everything .
This is a big ' no ' to the supreme leader . """
2009-06-23,"Political power is never good or bad , never really just or unjust ; political power is arbitrary , discriminatory and most of the time violent .
In Iran , the ongoing demonstrations sparked by the election results in favour of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad indicate that such power can never really be monopolised by the state .
Iran 's civil society is fighting ; it is giving blood for a just cause .
It is displaying its power , the power of the people .
Today , Iran must be considered one of the most vibrant democracies in the world because it is the people who are speaking .
The role of the supporters of the status quo has been reduced to reaction , which is why they are lashing out violently at those who question their legitimacy .
In all of this , the current civil unrest in Iran is historic , not only because it has already elicited compromises by the state , but also because it provides yet more evidence of the way societies can empower themselves against all odds .
These brave men and women on the streets of Tehran , Shiraz , Isfahan and other cities are moved by the same utopia that inspired their fathers and mothers three decades ago : the utopia of justice .
They believe that change is possible , that protest is not futile .
Confronting the arrogance of the establishment has been one of the main ideological planks of the Islamic revolution in 1979 .
It is now coming back to haunt those who have invented such slogans without necessarily adhering to them in the first place .
And yet the current situation in Iran is profoundly different from the situation in 1978 and 1979 .
First , the Islamic Republic has proven to be rather responsive to societal demands and rather flexible ideologically .
I do n't mean to argue that the Iranian state is entirely reflective of the will of the people .
I am saying that is it is not a totalitarian monolith that is pitted against a politically unified society .
The fissures of Iranian politics run through all levers of power in the country , which is why the whole situation appears scattered to us .
Whereas in 1979 the bad guy ( the Shah ) was easily identifiable to all revolutionaries , in today 's Iran such immediate identification is not entirely possible .
Who is the villain in the unfolding drama ?
Ahmadinejad ?
Those who demonstrated in support of him would beg to differ .
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ?
I would argue that he commands even stronger loyalties within the country and beyond .
The Revolutionary Guard or the Basij ?
Mohsen Rezai , one of the presidential candidates and an opponent of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who is contesting the election results , used to be the head of the former institution .
The picture becomes even more complicated when we take into consideration that some institutions of the state such as the parliament – via its speaker , Ali Larijani – have called for a thorough investigation of the violence perpetrated by members of the Basij and the police forces in a raid of student dormitories of Tehran University earlier this week . ""
What does it mean that in the middle of the night students are attacked in their dormitory ? ""
Larijani asked .
The fact that he said that "" the interior ministry ... should answer for it "" and that he stated that the "" parliament is seriously following the issue "" indicate that the good - v - bad verdict in today 's Iran is more blurred than in 1979 .
There is a second major difference to 1979 .
Today , the opposition to Ahmadinejad is fighting the establishment with the establishment .
Mir Hossein Mousavi himself was the prime minister of Iran during the first decade of the revolution , during a period when the current supreme leader , Ayatollah Khamenei , was president .
Mohammad Khatami , one of the main supporters of Mousavi , was president between 1997 and 2005 .
Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani , another political ally , is the head of the Assembly of Experts and another former president .
They are the engineers of the Islamic revolution and would never devour their project .
When some commentators say that what we are witnessing is a revolution they are at best naive and at worst following their own destructive agenda .
The dispute is about the future path of the Islamic Republic and the meaning of the revolution – not about overthrowing the whole system .
It is a game of politics and the people who are putting their lives at risk seem to be aware of that .
They are aware , in other words , that they are the most important force in the hands of those who want to gain or retain power .
Thus far the Iranian establishment has shown itself to be cunningly adaptable to crisis situations .
Those who have staged a revolution know how to sustain themselves .
And this is exactly what is happening in Iran .
The state is rescuing its political power through a mixture of incentives and pressure , compromise and detention , due process and systematic violence .
Moreover , when push comes to shove , the oppositional leaders around Mousavi would never question the system they have built up .
As Mousavi himself said in his fifth and most recent letter to the Iranian people : "" We are not against our sacred regime and its legal structures ; this structure guards our independence , freedom , and Islamic Republic . """
2009-06-23,"Their gesture attracted worldwide comment and drew the attention of football fans to Iran 's political turmoil .
Now the country 's authorities have taken revenge by imposing life bans on players who sported green wristbands in a recent World Cup match in protest against Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's disputed re - election .
According to the pro - government newspaper Iran , four players – Ali Karimi , 31 , Mehdi Mahdavikia , 32 , Hosein Ka'abi , 24 and Vahid Hashemian , 32 – have been "" retired "" from the sport after their gesture in last Wednesday 's match against South Korea in Seoul .
They were among six players who took to the field wearing wristbands in the colour of the defeated opposition candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi , which has been adopted by demonstrators who believe the 12 June election was stolen .
Most of the players obeyed instructions to remove the armwear at half - time , but Mahdavikia wore his green captain 's armband for the entire match .
The four are also said to have been banned from giving media interviews .
The fate of the other two players who wore the wristbands is unknown .
None of the team members were given back their passports upon returning to Tehran after the match , which ended in a 1 - 1 draw – a result that ended Iran 's hopes of qualifying for next year 's tournament .
Karimi is one of Iranian football 's best - known stars , having played for the German club Bayern Munich .
Ka'abi played for Leicester City for several months during the 2007/8 season .
Hashemian and Mahdavikia play for the German teams Bochum and Eintracht Frankfurt .
The gesture acutely embarrassed Iranian officials .
The team 's chief administrative officer , Mansour Pourhiedari , initially claimed the wristbands had been intended as a religious tribute to a revered Shia figure in the hope that it would deliver a victory on the pitch .
Iran 's hardline media have since linked the protest to the arrest on Saturday of Mohsen Safayi Farahani , who headed the country 's football governing body under the former reformist president , Mohammad Khatami .
He is one of several dozen opposition politicians , intellectuals and journalists to have been detained .
Hezbollah , a pro - Ahmadinejad website , accused Farahani , a member of the pro - reform Islamic participation front , of bribing the players to wear the symbols .
Farahani was one of several prominent figures accused by Ahmadinejad of corruption during the recent election campaign .
Ahmadinejad , a known football fan , has taken a close interest in the sport 's affairs .
In 2006 Iran was banned from international competition by the world governing body Fifa after claims of improper interference by his government .
The ban was later lifted .
This year the national team coach Ali Daei was sacked , reportedly on Ahmadinejad 's orders , after a 2 - 1 home defeat by Saudi Arabia ."
2009-06-23,"Troubled relations between Britain and Iran hit a new low today with the tit - for - tat expulsion of each other 's diplomats .
But the move was hardly surprising after Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader , singled out the UK as the "" most evil "" country when he ruled out any concessions over the disputed presidential election in his speech last Friday .
Iran 's nuclear ambitions and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's leadership style are serious points of contention .
But rows and ructions have been the norm between the two countries since before the 1979 Islamic revolution .
So there was a grim inevitability about the spat as Tehran blamed its old adversary for mass protests over the "" stolen "" vote .
Often dubbed the "" Little Satan , "" to the "" Great Satan "" of the US , Britain occupies a special place in Iranian official demonology .
Many Iranians are still convinced the BBC helped topple the Peacock throne and bring Ayatollah Khomeini to power , ironic in the light of the role being played by the BBC 's new Persian TV channel , a huge irritant to the authorities in Tehran .
Britain 's negative image in Iran dates back to the 19th century when it sought to protect India , vied with Russia for strategic influence and rode roughshod over Persian sensibilities .
It occupied the country in 1941 and exiled Reza Shah for his pro - German sympathies .
The most damaging moment came in 1953 when MI6 helped the CIA mount a coup against Muhammad Mossadegh , the popular prime minister who had dared to nationalise the Anglo - Iranian oil company – forerunner to BP .
In the 1960s and 1970s Britain backed the Shah as the pliable "" policeman "" of the Gulf – a counterweight to Soviet influence in the Middle East – and treated Iran as a lucrative export market .
British ambassador Sir Anthony Parsons famously reported to London that the Shah 's position was secure as late as 1978 .
In 1980 Iran 's London embassy was taken over by Iraqi - backed gunmen from Khuzestan , and the siege was ended by the famous SAS hostage rescue .
The extensive British embassy compound in Tehran was closed after the revolution and only reopened fully in 1988 when the war with Iraq ended .
The main road outside , Churchill Avenue , was renamed Bobby Sands Avenue , in honour of the Northern Ireland hunger striker – two fingers to British imperialism .
Britain , like the US , was accused of backing Saddam Hussein and secretly arming him with the chemical weapons used against the Islamic republic .
Post - war relations were dominated by the fatwa issued by Khomeini ordering the killing of Salman Rushdie , whose novel The Satanic Verses was deemed blasphemous .
Iran was also accused of backing the IRA and a bugging device was found in Iran 's recently refurbished London embassy .
Attacks on Iranian dissidents abroad were another problem , as was its backing for Shia hostage - taking .
The atmosphere improved under the reformist president Mohammed Khatami , enabling Robin Cook , then foreign secretary , to resolve the Rushdie affair .
Soon there was co - operation over drug trafficking from Afghanistan .
After the 9/11 attacks Iran pledged support for fighting terrorism and the new UK foreign secretary , Jack Straw , visited the country .
But in 2003 the US - led invasion of Iraq led to new tensions , as did the fear Iran was seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
In 2007 there was a tense standoff when Iran seized 15 British sailors , accusing them of trespassing in Iranian waters .
Ahmadinejad 's comments on the Holocaust and Israel , as well as Iranian support for Hezbollah and the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas , have kept the regime at odds with Britain and other western countries .
January 's launch of BBC Persian TV infuriated the Iranians , whose harassment then forced the closure of the British Council offices in Tehran .
Here is their news : Iranian TV 's take ' The BBC made my son protest ' Yesterday 's diplomatic spat comes amid escalating accusations and denials .
The following is a transcript of part of an Iranian state television report yesterday , as relayed by BBC monitoring : [ Presenter ]
The few rioters who disturbed Tehran 's order in the past few days have made significant statements regarding their objectives .
[ Female with pixellated face ] There was a military hand grenade in my handbag and in my son 's bag .
It was all because my son wanted to have power and show that he could take power against his own country and his fellow countrymen .
This was all because of an atmosphere created by the BBC in Iran .
I was influenced by this channel .
[ Another young woman ] I was influenced by [ Voice of America ] Persian and the BBC .
They were reporting that the [ police ] forces were the ones who were beating up people .
I wanted to know what was happening and whether or not this was true .
But when I went there , I realised that most of us protesters were attacking government property , the [ police ] forces and other people ...
Those who were protesting were somehow rioting .
We set public property on fire , threw stones at people 's cars , there were no [ police ] forces near us to be hit by our stones .
We hurled stones at other people 's cars , doors , windows , intercoms .
We set motorcycles on fire .
When I was running from the police yesterday my dad did n't want to open the door and let me in .
I opened the door with force and sought refuge at home , but I was finally arrested ."
2009-06-23,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the winner of Iran 's disputed presidential election , is to be sworn in by mid - August , Iranian media reported today after the authorities ruled out an annulment of the result .
IRNA , the official Iranian news agency , said Ahmadinejad , who won a "" closely contested and disputed 10th presidential election "" , would be sworn in before parliament between 26 July and 19 August .
The news will sharpen the dilemma for the defeated reformist candidate , Mir Hossein Mousavi , who maintains that the 12 June vote was fraudulent , and that he is the true winner .
He must now decide whether to accept an apparent fait accompli or keep up the protest movement that has brought hundreds of thousands out on to the streets of Tehran .
Iran 's interior ministry declared Ahmadinejad the winner with almost two - thirds of the vote , and Iranian state television reported that the country 's top electoral authority had declared itself satisfied with the result .
A spokesman for the powerful guardian council , Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei , was quoted by Iran 's state - run English language Press TV as saying the organisation had found "" no major fraud or breach in the election "" .
As a result , he said , the outcome would not be annulled .
The move came after Iranian security forces yesterday threatened a "" decisive and revolutionary confrontation "" with opposition demonstrators if protests continued against the regime ..
The threat from the Revolutionary Guards signalled that the powerful conservative force could intervene directly to end the political crisis .
Protests continued yesterday despite several deaths over the weekend and increasingly violent methods used by the police and the pro - regime Basij paramilitaries .
Amid Iranian allegations of British involvement in the protest movement , Reuters reported that discussions had taken place on the temporary recall of Iran 's ambassador to the UK .
The Iranian MP Mahmoud Ahmadi said : "" It was proposed for relations with Britain to be lowered to the level of chargé d'affaires .
This proposal ... did not reach a conclusion and lawmakers did not insist on it , "" he told the ISNA news agency .
Meanwhile , the Iranian interior ministry refused to issue a permit for a rally called for by Iranian students outside the UK embassy in Tehran .
The British embassy in Tehran has already begun evacuating the families of members of staff , and the Foreign Office advised against inessential travel to Iran as Tehran stoked public anger against "" evil Britain "" .
The parliamentary speaker , Ali Larijani , called for a "" revision "" of diplomatic ties with the UK in the light of what he alleged was British meddling , an allegation denied on Sunday by the foreign secretary , David Miliband .
British diplomats warned , however , that a further worsening of the bilateral relationship was likely in the next few days in view of Tehran 's allegations .
The European Union , represented by the Czech government , summoned Iran 's chargé d'affaires and "" categorically rejected "" all allegations of interference , while the Italian embassy offered humanitarian aid to injured demonstrators .
In a statement issued by the UN , the secretarygeneral , Ban Ki - moon urged the authorities to "" respect fundamental civil and political rights , especially the freedom of expression , freedom of assembly and freedom of information "" .
Ban called on the Iranian government and the opposition to resolve their differences peacefully through dialogue and legal means .
In a boost for the embattled regime , Russia said it respected the declared election result .
In his only trip abroad since the vote , Ahmadinejad went to Russia last week for a conference , at which he was seen prominently shaking hands with the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev .
At least 17 protesters have been killed in the protests in Iran so far , according to official figures .
A video showing the death of a young woman , Neda Agha Soltan , who was shot dead by a sniper on Saturday , was widely circulated in Iran and around the world .
The image has helped to instil fear in opposition ranks but some observers predicted that it might also galvanise the wavering protest movement in the weeks ahead as it mourns her death .
Following the bloodshed on Saturday , the turnout for demonstrations yesterday was much smaller than last week .
Only a few hundred protesters gathered in Tehran 's vast Haft - e - Tir Square and they appeared to be outnumbered by riot police firing teargas and Basij militiamen on motorbikes armed with rifles , as helicopters flew overhead .
Gunmen were visible at windows of government buildings around the square , as well as policemen with cameras taking pictures of the demonstrators .
The judiciary has threatened to set up special courts to try dissidents . ""
The rioters should be dealt with in an exemplary way and the judiciary will do that , "" a senior judiciary official , Ebrahim Raisi , said .
The government backlash against the protesters intensified as the regime acknowledged serious problems with the elections .

2009-06-26,"Jailed Iranian reformists are believed to have been tortured in an attempt to force them into TV "" confessions "" of a foreign - led plot against the Islamic regime .
According to Iranian websites , the "" confessions "" are aimed at implicating Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , the defeated reformist candidates in this month 's presidential poll , in an alleged conspiracy .
Mostafa Tajzadeh , Abdollah Ramezanzadeh and Mohsen Aminzadeh , all Mousavi supporters , are reported to have undergone "" intensive interrogation "" sessions in Tehran 's notorious Evin prison since being arrested in a mass round - up of opposition figures following Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's disputed re - election .
The three , who all served in the government of the former reformist president , Mohammad Khatami , are among several hundred activists , academics , journalists and students detained in a crackdown coinciding with the brutal suppression of street protesters who believe the election was stolen .
Fellow prisoners are reported to have heard screams of pain from Tajzadeh , a former deputy interior minister , and Ramezanzadeh , who was Khatami 's government spokesman , during interrogations at Evin 's section 209 , which is reserved for political prisoners and run by the hardline intelligence ministry .
Aminzadeh , an ex - deputy foreign minister , was heard shouting "" I am not going to give interviews . ""
A spokesman for Amnesty International said the reports came from "" very credible sources "" .
The Iranian authorities have used this technique before to humiliate and discredit opponents .
In 2007 , state television aired "" confessions "" by US - Iranian academics Haleh Esfandiari , Kian Tajbakhsh and Ramin Jahanbegloo in which they said they had worked with pro - democracy groups that the regime claimed were plotting its downfall .
This week , state television broadcast interviews with several people admitting to being "" terrorists "" after purportedly taking part in street demonstrations .
Tajzadeh 's wife , Fakhrosadat Mohtashamipour , told the pro - reform website Emruz that she and a lawyer had been denied access to him since his arrest the day after the 12 June election . ""
Any quote or remarks made by these people in the current situation has no credibility .
My husband 's only crime is his efforts to secure a high turnout , "" she said .
Tajzadeh , 53 , a member of the pro - reform Islamic Participation Front and the Islamic Revolution Mojahedin Organisation , has been a staunch critic of Ahmadinejad .
After the president was first elected four years ago , Tajzadeh told the Guardian that Ahmadinejad 's leading supporters wanted to create an atmosphere similar to that under the Taliban in Afghanistan .
Renewed fears have been voiced over the health of another jailed reformist , Saeed Hajarian , a former Khatami adviser who is severely disabled from a failed assassination attempt nine years ago .
Reports of Hajarian 's death on blogs and Twitter were dismissed by the reformist website Parlemannews , which quoted "" informed sources "" as saying he was in "" relative health "" and being given essential medication and care .
Meanwhile , state TV reported that the head of Mousavi 's information committee , Abolfazl Fateh , had been prevented from leaving Iran for Britain , where he is a PhD student .
Fars , a pro - Ahmadinejad news agency close to the country 's Revolutionary Guard , said he had been banned from travelling to allow the authorities to investigate "" recent gatherings "" , a reference to the pro - Mousavi demonstrations ."
2009-06-26,"Hopes for a significant revision of Iran 's disputed presidential election results have been buried by a finding from the country 's Guardian Council that the vote was the "" healthiest "" since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
The council , the country 's top legislative body , today declared there were no major violations in the 12 June poll , which was officially won by the incumbent hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
It had already rejected a call by Mir Hossein Mousavi , officially declared second , for the election to be annulled because of suspected widespread vote - rigging .
Underlining the regime 's hardline stance , a senior cleric called for "" rioters ' leaders "" to be executed .
Protests over the "" stolen "" election have continued for nearly two weeks , fading in recent days after a crackdown by state security forces and a perceived lack of leadership by Mousavi .
About 20 people have been killed and hundreds beaten and arrested .
At today 's Friday prayers at Tehran University – always a platform for the regime – a senior cleric , Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami , urged harsh punishment of protesters .
"" I want the judiciary to ... punish leading rioters firmly and without showing any mercy to teach everyone a lesson , "" he told worshippers .
Khatami used the term "" mohareb "" – meaning "" one who wages war against God "" – a crime punishable by death under Islamic law .
Khatami 's sermon , broadcast live on state TV , included the charges that the unrest was supported by Israel and the US , and that foreign journalists had reported falsely on the situation .
He claimed that Neda Agha Soltan , the young woman who became a symbol of the opposition movement after she was shot dead , was a victim of protesters , not the Iranian security forces . ""
Government forces do not shoot at a lady standing in a side street , "" he said .
Dozens of Soltan 's friends and relatives managed to pay their respects to her today at Tehran 's Behesht - e Zahra cemetery .
They uttered brief prayers and placed flowers on her grave , witnesses told the Associated Press , which along with all foreign news organisations is banned from reporting from the streets .
In Trieste , Italy , foreign ministers attending the G8 summit called for an immediate end to the violence .
"" I think there is unity here that it is for the Iranian people to choose their government , but it is for the Iranian government to protect their people , "" said Britain 's foreign secretary , David Miliband .
"" The violence we have seen over the last 10 days and the killings and the beatings are deplorable and they show a failure to protect their own people .

2009-06-26,"The battle on the streets of Tehran and the provincial towns of Iran arises not merely in a disputed election but in the clash of two views of Persian history that have become hard to reconcile .
For Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , declared the 10th president of the Islamic republic in what even his supporters hail as a "" miracle "" , history ended on 1 February 1979 , when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned from exile in Paris to inaugurate the new revolutionary government .
The story of humanity , which up to that moment had been the persistent thwarting of God 's will by Jews , Arabs , heretics , kings , drunkards , liberals and the British , had now entered its end phase .
It was just a matter for a learned cleric to administer first Iran , then the whole world , until the Lord of Time revealed himself to his favourite nation and ushered in an age of justice and the end of the world .
The Lord of Time , or Mahdi , the 12th descendant of the prophet Muhammad through his daughter Fatemeh , escaped Arab persecution as a small boy in Iraq and went into hiding in 874 .
Present in the world in flesh and bone , the Mahdi passes unrecognised through the Shia cities , walking perhaps even among the Tehran crowds streaming between Enqelab and Azad .
Yet for many supporters of the defeated candidates in the election , there is another view of history that rejects Khomeini 's fantastic theories of clerical government , the religiosity of Ahmadinejad , the grinding air of eschatological menace and , above all , the regime 's metaphysical liberties with the truth .
This view has it that Iran , in cutting itself off from the mainstream of world affairs , has squandered its God - given wealth and condemned itself to insignificance or ridicule .
We British , with our blase attitude to our parliament and its venal members , forget just how long and hard the Iranians have fought for representative government .
This liberal Iranian view has its best expression in the opening to Ahmad Kasravi 's Tarikh - e Mashrute - ye Iran , or History of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution , which first saw the light in Arabic in 1921 , came out in various Persian forms in the 1930s and is now partly available in a superb English translation :
"" We know that when Nader Shah was killed , the greatness his efforts had given Iran vanished .
But Iran was still included among the renowned countries of Asia , and if Karim Khan and his successors did not add anything to the country , neither did they subtract from it .
But in the times of the Qajars , Iran became very weak and lost much of its greatness , prestige and renown .
This was chiefly because the world had changed and countries had stirred , but Iran remained in the same state in which it had been .
There were violent movements and unparalleled historical events in Europe , such as the French Revolution , the rise of Napoleon and his incessant wars , the movement of the masses , progress in the art of war , the appearance of machinery and so on .
Iran was ignorant of these changes and did not benefit from them at all . ""
Ahmad Kasravi was born in modest circumstances in 1890 in the Turkish - speaking city of Tabriz in north - west Iran .
Bred up for the Shia clergy , his life was changed in 1905 by the popular movement to secure parliamentary government from the feckless and extravagant Qajar monarchy .
A protest against mismanagement and famine and the sale by the Qajars of mining and trading concessions to shady City of London interests changed on the streets of Tabriz and Tehran into a full - blown movement for liberty and the rule of law .
To this , the first democratic revolution in Asia , Kasravi brings a mixture of philosophical sensibility and direct experience : "" They are n't demanding cheap bread .
But want do they want ? "" "" They want a constitution . "" "" Constitution ? !
What 's a constitution ? ""
"" Go yourself and find out what a constitution is . ""
In this long book , which runs to 905 pages in the best Persian edition , Kasravi recounts how the spontaneous alliance of clergy , bazar , craftsmen and intellectuals forged in 1905 - 6 disintegrated when the Shia clergy became aware of some of the wider consequences of Enlightenment ideas .
They were shocked to learn that liberty included liberty not to pray or wash , and equality might even be extended to Jews , Christians and Zoroastrians .
In short , the new parliament , instead of merely interpreting and enforcing the divine law known as sharia , would actually give law to the Muslims .
As Kasravi writes : "" The interests of the mass of people diverged from those of the mullahs and village owners , particularly in Tabriz , where liberal ferment was more effective . ""
Meanwhile , the liberals had the bit between their teeth : "" Those who had visited Europe recalled things about the European way of life which they brought home like souvenirs . ""
Many of the clergy turned against the revolution , including the most learned and courageous of the Tehran divines , Sheikh Fazlollah Nuri , who was to be a firm influence on Khomeini .
Sheikh Fazlollah was executed by the constitutionalists on 31 July 1909 .
This break in the alliance between clergy and liberals is the dominant theme or tragedy of modern Iranian history .
It has permitted a succession of government coups d'etat , first when the Qajars ' Cossack forces bombarded the parliament in 1908 , and then in 1921 when a Cossack officer named Reza Khan seized power and established the Pahlavi dynasty .
Reza , and then his son Muhammad Reza , imposed despotic government for much of the period from 1925 to 1979 .
Under the Pahlavis , the clergy conspired in the royal coup against the popular government of Muhammad Mossadeq in 1953 , while the liberals turned a blind eye to the persecution of the clergy both in the 1930s and after Khomeini took on the Pahlavi court in 1963 and was driven into exile .
The two groups composed or papered over their differences in the late 1970s , when it seemed that for a second time Iran was being sold to foreigners under Muhammad Reza .
Together they were able to mobilise millions of demonstrators over the winter of 1978/79 and send Muhammad Reza into exile .
The Iraqi invasion of 1980 and the eight years of war forged a solidarity that persisted into the 1990s .
These two wings split apart again soon after polls closed on 12 June this year .
A reading of Kasravi 's History suggests that by far the most likely outcome of recent events in Iran , from a purely historical point of view , is despotism .
One wonders if Khomeini 's successor as regent or leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , as he looked down on Ahmadinejad kneeling in the front row at Friday prayers at Tehran University on 19 June , had the leisure to reflect : "" How in the name of God are we going to get rid of this gentleman in four years ' time ?
"" For all his historical insight , profound linguistic knowledge and purity of style , Kasravi shares in good measure that violence of thought to which Iranians were prone in the 20th century .
A judge in the secular courts in the 1920s and a university teacher in the 30s , he repeatedly quarrelled with the Pahlavi regime .
He was not free of eccentricity .
Kasravi had a peculiar aversion to Persian poetry , considered by many to be one of the glories of Iranian civilisation and quite a match for poetry in English . ""
Iranians have been plagued by poetry for many years , and have suffered a lot for it , "" Kasravi writes in the History His principal bugbear was superstition , or rather the parade of Shia ceremonies that punctuate the Iranian calendar , the cursing of the early caliphs , and the self - flagellation and mourning for the prophet 's family , persecuted and done to death by the Arab dynasties .
While the Orientalist historians were charmed by these bloody ceremonies , finding them both picturesque and distinctively Persian , Kasravi saw them as mere mechanisms for despotic control .
For him , the Iranians of 1905 were "" a people who had for centuries borne the yoke of oppression and autocracy , knowing nothing except sectarian conflict , pointless Moharram and Safar ceremonies and such , being so unfamiliar with the meaning of nation and country and so on , and having had no freedom to discuss their sufferings . ""
The prophet Muhammad performed no miracles , but the Iranians know better .
Khomeini loathed popular superstition .
Not so his successors .
Addressing the UN general assembly in New York in 2005 , Ahmadinejad says he felt an aura of light around his head that kept the delegates transfixed in their places for almost half an hour .
The famous halo is the butt of endless ridicule in Iran , most recently in a song addressed to Ahmadinejad in the style of the medieval poet Molavi , which has become a sort of anthem of the Tehran June : "" You are violence without sight/ A halo without the light . ""
Though sympathetic in the History to the courageous divines of 1905 - 6 , Kasravi became more and more bitterly anti - clerical .
In the course of the 1930s , he came to argue that the Shia itself was a perversion of the prophet 's Islam .
That brought him to the attention not only of Khomeini but of a young seminarian , Muhammad Navvab Safavi , who had been influenced by Khomeini 's early writings on Islamic government and founded a terrorist group called the Fedayan - e Islam ( "" Devotees of Islam "" ) .
Brought to trial for his anti - clerical stance in Tehran , Kasravi was butchered in open court along with his secretary , Muhammad Taqi Hadadpur , on 11 March 1946 .
According to a recently published interview with a Fedayan - e Islam veteran , one of the assassins , Hosein Emami , appeared at the central police station waving a blood - stained knife and crying : "" I have killed Kasravi !
The man who is burning the Qur'an ! ""
He was turned away as a madman and later pardoned .
The Fedayan went on to assassinate the prime minister and may have been behind the attempt on the life of Muhammad Reza in the garden of Tehran University in 1949 .
Navvab Safavi was executed by the Pahlavis in 1955 , and his followers dispersed into Khomeini 's movement , where they performed some of the rough work .
Navvab Safavi is commemorated by a metro station and parkway in Tehran .
Khomeini , himself a brilliant stylist , conceded on television in 1979 that Kasravi knew his history and was a good writer , but was a vile man who sought prophethood .
When , in 1989 , Khomeini declared Salman Rushdie 's life forfeit , older Iranians remembered Kasravi .
The fine new translation from Mazda Publishers is by Evan Siegel , a professor of mathematics at New Jersey City University who also happens to be expert in many of the languages of the Middle East and the Caucasus .
Of the History , Siegel has translated the first third , and plans to complete volumes two and three this year .
If there is a difficulty for the general reader , it is the strange nomenclature of that period before the introduction of surnames by the Pahlavis in 1921 , and the baffling proliferation of aristocratic titles : Eye of the State , Trustee of the Throne and so on .
Sometimes , the same title is carried by three different individuals .
If he negotiates that difficulty , he will pass into the wide plain of Iranian history with its haunting echoes and compulsive repetitions ."
2009-06-28,"That Iran 's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has his back up against the wall and is fighting for survival should trigger joy and jubilation in Cairo 's corridors of power , as well as in some other Arab capitals .
After all , this is the man whose radical anti - western and anti - Israeli rhetoric plays well with certain segments of the Egyptian public frustrated at their own government 's US client status and acquiescence in cutting off Gaza during the recent Israeli invasion .
Ahmadinejad is also the face of the hardline regime that has been positioning itself to become a regional superpower – a position Egypt covets – and whose ambiguous nuclear ambitions and backing of radical Islamist movements is a threat .
But there has been a deafening silence from the Egyptian regime .
Even the loyal scribes of the government - owned segments of the press have sheathed their vitriolic pens and stopped lobbing their poison arrows at the Iranian leadership .
What could be putting such a damper on the party ?
Well , the Egyptian leadership finds itself caught between the rock it would like to lob at Ahmadinejad and the hard place of smashing its own glass house by openly criticising election fraud .
After all , although not as blatant as the 99 % approval ratings of yesteryear , the regime still ca n't kick its election fraud compulsion .
Perhaps more importantly , President Hosni Mubarak and his cabal fear that Egypt – similar to Iran in terms of demography , inequality and repression – is susceptible to the Iranian protest virus .
The regime "" fears the ' Iranian flu ' contagion … especially as such dangerous ideas spread faster than the swine flu virus , "" Ali Bresha wrote on the Al - Arabiya news channel 's website .
So far , the Egyptian people have revealed a remarkable immunity to the Tehran syndrome ( in fact , some conspiracy theorists believe it 's a western plot ) , and the feared political pandemic has failed to materialise .
Has the government 's political inoculation programme proven more effective than its botched response to avian flu or do the Egyptian people possess some kind of socially innate antibody against mass protest ?
The question of Egyptian political apathy is one that has intrigued me for many years .
Egypt suffers enormous socio - economic inequalities , widespread youth unemployment , and the political marginalisation of the masses , and yet Egyptians tolerate an unresponsive government plagued with rampant corruption and a poor human rights record .
There is , of course , opposition to the regime , with many political figures and activists , such as those operating under the umbrella Kifaya ( Enough ) movement , not to mention the workers unions , taking great risks in calling for reform .
And yet they have failed to inspire mass momentum .
Young people are showing more determination than my generation .
My youngest brother and his friends are politically aware and some are active in the opposition .
Unlike the majority of Egyptians , Osama was even determined to cast a vote against Mubarak , the only political father his generation have ever known , in the 2005 elections , despite attempts to dissuade him outside the voting station .
However , such people are still a minority as was demonstrated during the largely unsuccessful call for a second general strike made by the Shabab 6 April Youth Movement ( whose membership on Facebook alone stands at more than 75,000 ) .
I 'm not really one to criticise as the political rebel in me has rarely ventured beyond the written word into the realm of direct action , but why this inability to mobilise ?
Of course , there is the fear factor , but the Egyptian regime is hardly the most repressive in the world .
Maybe it has something to do with the Egyptian government 's ability to aptly blend the use of enough terror to dissuade people and enough progress and freedom to keep the pressure cooker from exploding .
Perhaps it is related to Egypt 's opposition being weak and divided , as well as there being no inspirational leader , like Mir - Hussein Mousavi , around whom a broad - based reform movement can form .
Egyptian apathy might also be linked to the fact that , despite all the upheavals of major change the country has endured , things seem stubbornly and frustratingly much the same .
In less than a century , the country has gone from monarchy to a one - party socialist republic to a free market neo - liberal oligarchy which may soon have a hereditary president .
Yet freedom , despite some minor gains , has been an elusive prize .
And like the tired old nation that it is , Egypt has had trouble keeping up and is no longer even the richest Arab country , nor the region 's most powerful nation .
Some hold that the Egyptian people possess some sort of cultural gene against rebellion and risk taking , and the profusion of popular sayings we have against rocking the boat – such as "" Stay away from evil and sing to it "" – provides some credence to this idea .
Egyptians tend to prefer to get on with their lives outside the system rather than overturn it .
This could have something to do with the fact that for more than two millennia Egyptians were ruled by a long succession of foreigners who generally cared little for their well - being .
Initial jubilation at self - determination and self - rule has given way over the decades to the sinking realisation that Egypt 's native rulers are just as alien ."
2009-06-29,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , today ordered an investigation into the killing of Neda Agha Soltan , who has become a symbol of the protest movement after a video of her dying moments was circulated on the internet .
In a letter to the head of the country 's judiciary , Ahmadinejad partly acknowledged public outrage at her death by describing it as a "" heartfelt event "" .
The president – whose disputed re - election on 12 June led to demonstrations in Tehran – suggested that Soltan 's death was "" suspicious "" , despite eyewitness accounts that she was shot by riot police on motorcycles during a violent crackdown on opposition protests . ""
Neda Agha Soltan was shot dead in one of Tehran 's streets on 20 June by unknown elements in a completely suspicious way , "" he said .
He also accused the foreign media of using the case for propaganda purposes "" to distort the pure and clean image of the Islamic Republic in the world "" .
The Iranian authorities attempted to blame the death of the 26-year - old philosophy student on terrorists , outsiders and even the BBC , with a number of conspiracy theories put forward in the state - run media .
But many observers view the investigation ordered by Ahmadinejad as a tacit admission that these theories have convinced nobody .
His letter said : "" I request you to order the judicial system to seriously follow up the murder case … and identify elements behind the case and inform the people of the result . ""
Soltan was shot on 20 June , a day after Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , had threatened protesters with "" consequences "" if they continued to take to the streets ."
2009-06-30,"President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad today hailed his contested re - election as a victory for the Iranian people and a defeat for the enemies of the Islamic Republic .
Speaking a day after the country 's Guardian Council confirmed his defeat of challenger Mir Hossein Mousavi , Ahmadinejad sounded a triumphant note as he contemplated a second four - year term in office , promising cooperation to end "" the global monopoly "" in all areas . ""
This election was actually a referendum , "" the state IRNA news agency quoted him as saying .
"" The Iranian nation were the victors and the enemies ... failed and could n't reach their aims . ""
Ahmadinejad and other hardliners had insisted from the start that the 12 June presidential poll was free and fair – in the face of widespread protests that the results had been rigged and millions of votes "" stolen .
"" They also blamed foreign governments , especially Britain and the BBC , for fomenting the unrest .
But Monday 's Guardian Council ruling – after a recount of 10 % of the votes – dashed any lingering hopes that the result could be changed or annulled , as Mousavi and supporters had demanded .
In a report today , forensic statistician Walter Mebane of the University of Michigan concluded that the poll results "" suggest very strongly that there was widespread fraud in which the vote counts for Ahmadinejad were substantially augmented by artificial means . ""
Ahmadinejad , who was lavishly praised by senior clerics , is expected to be sworn in for his new term between 26 July and 19 August .
Abolfazl Fateh , head of Mousavi 's information committee , condemned post - election detentions and investigations as "" unethical and illegal . ""
The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran pressed for the UN secretary general , Ban Ki - moon , to visit Iran or send a special envoy to demand an investigation into the violence .
The group said reports from in Iran indicated that as many as 2,000 people may be under arrest .
In London , foreign secretary , David Miliband told MPs that Britain was working with allies to agree on a united position for dealing with the new Iranian government .
He said the European Union would have to impose tougher sanctions on Iran if it did not accept an international offer for talks on its nuclear programme by the end of the year .
On Saturday nine Iranian staff of the British embassy in Tehran were detained , accused of encouraging protests .
Four remain in custody .
Britain flatly rejects Tehran 's charge of interfering in Iranian politics .
"" We are extremely concerned at the continued detention of some of our locally engaged staff in Tehran , "" Miliband said .
"" This is unacceptable harassment and intimidation , as European foreign ministers made clear on Sunday . ""
Miliband said he had discussed the affair with the Iranian foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki ."
2009-06-30,"A partial recount of Iran 's disputed election resulted in a small increase in the vote for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , state media announced today , dashing hopes of a rerun .
The powerful Guardian Council , which oversaw a random recount on 10 % of the ballots , declared a "" slight "" increase in Ahmadinejad 's vote in some cities , said the semi - official Fars news agency .
The verdict is expected to widen divisions in Iran between supporters of the regime and supporters of the opposition candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi who are convinced Ahmadinejad stole the election .
The size of the increase was not specified but the council said it was not enough to alter the overall official result which gave Ahmadinejad 62 % of the vote .
The council said Ahmadinejad 's vote increased in the south - eastern province of Kerman – Iran 's second largest province – and singled out the city of Jiroft as an example .
It recounted 17 of the city 's 170 ballot boxes and declared that Ahmadinejad 's tally increased by 12 votes .
Mousavi 's vote went down five in the city .
The changes from the recount were declared "" too small "" to change the outcome of the election .
Ayatollah Ahmed Jannati , who heads the Guardian Council , said a "" meticulous and comprehensive examination "" revealed only "" slight irregularities that are common to any election and needless of attention , "" according to the state TV channel IRIB .
Mousavi and the other defeated candidates , Mahdi Karroubi and Mohsen Rezaei , boycotted the recount by refusing to send representatives as the council had requested .
Fars also reported that recounts in cities of Qom , Gorgan and Sari resulted in no changes to the original results .
Mousavi , who has called for a rerun of the election , has yet to comment on the recount .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , questioned the limited nature of the recount .
"" They [ the regime ] have a huge credibility gap with their own people as to the election process .
And I do n't think that 's going to disappear by any finding of a limited review of a relatively small number of ballots , "" she said .
Asked if the USwould recognise Ahmadinejad as Iran 's legitimate president , Clinton said : "" We 're going to take this a day at a time . """
2009-06-30,"The Iranian authorities hated Persepolis .
While it charmed western film critics , audiences and the Cannes film festival jury , one of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's advisers said the distinctive black and white cartoon "" presented an unrealistic picture of the achievements of the glorious Islamic revolution "" .
Ahmadinejad and his cronies will probably be even more infuriated by the update to the cartoon :
Persepolis 2.0 .
The latest version depicts the excitement surrounding the June 12 election , outrage at the result , street protests , the role of Twitter in the unrest , and the death of Neda Agha Soltan .
The new cartoon was the initiative of two Iranian exiles called Sina and Payman , who have put together a website called Spread Persepolis to promote the project .
It was made with permission of the publishers of Marjane Satrapi 's original cartoon on which the film was based .
Sina said the updated cartoon was intended to show how history was repeating itself in Iran . ""
The reaction to Persepolis 2.0 has been great , "" he wrote in an email .
"" We 've had visitors from 120 countries thus far , and a large volume of emails from people asking how they can help support Iranians . ""
This has really infused us with energy , and we 're now working on additional ways to help get the word out . ""
He added : "" I 've read some comments online from people angry that we ' ruined ' Satrapi 's work or unhappy with the poor quality of the copy .
Their opinions are valid , but our point was just to get people to discuss Iran so that it did n't slip back into collective obscurity . ""
Her cartoon are about her life but to my generation of Iranians ( at least in the West )
they have become more than that , they have become iconic .
The fact that images from 30 years ago can tell a story about what is happening now makes them all the more powerful . ""
Unlike her original work , Persepolis 2.0 is filled with flaws and inaccuracies , but the bottom line is that it has helped spark hundreds of conversations and that 's more than we could have expected . """
2009-06-30,"If the Iranian regime hesitated over tactics when protests erupted over the "" theft "" of the presidential elections by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , it was well prepared on one front : internet censorship is both routine and highly developed in the Islamic Republic , so when the crackdown came it was swift and – fairly – effective .
Iran uses what the OpenNet Initiative calls "" one of the most extensive technical filtering systems in the world "" .
Internet providers are required to go through state - controlled gateways .
Reformist websites , Flickr , foreign blogs and social networks such as Facebook were all sporadically blocked before the elections , but censorship intensified once the unrest began .
Filtering has become much heavier in the last fortnight .
"" It is very bad , "" says a keen internet user in north Tehran .
"" They 're tightening the circle . ""
The internet is said to be running at less than a tenth the speed it usually does .
"" The authorities are aware that almost every internet user knows how to get around the filtering and they do n't care much about it , "" said Mehrdad , a student .
"" But once there is a danger the internet may undermine the political system , they intensify censorship so it gets very difficult to get access to blocked websites even with anti - filter software . ""
Crucially , all internet traffic in and out of Iran travels through one portal – the Telecommunications Company of Iran ( TCI ) – though a few service providers operate below it .
This makes it easier to monitor traffic .
Sophisticated software allows officials to look at a website or tweet and see the IP address it came from .
Decisions on blocking are made by a committee of government officials , members of the judiciary and intelligence services .
Filtering is done by the telecommunications ministry . ""
The authorities can filter a new website within 24 hours , "" said Mahmood Enayat , an Iranian expert at the Oxford Internet Institute .
"" They monitor very intensively .
It 's not really that sophisticated as they use domain names rather than key words , but that 's still enough to stop users ' access . ""
Yet unless the authorities are prepared to damage vital economic interests such as banking , access to the internet can never be totally blocked .
And tech - savvy users can buy anti - filtering software , encrypt messages or , increasingly , use proxies – servers set up in other countries which allow Iranians to hide their computer 's IP address from prying eyes .
Another method used by the state is deliberately to reduce bandwidth to prevent the transmission of mobile phone - recorded video .
Still , that did n't stop the world seeing the now iconic 40-second film of Neda Agha - Soltan bleeding to death on a street in Tehran .
"" If you put 65 million people in a locked room , they 're going to find all the exits pretty quickly , and maybe make a few of their own , "" commented James Cowie on the Renesys internet intelligence blog ."
2009-07-01,"No election since the inception of the Islamic Republic has left the Iranian nation so divided in all its components as the one that took place on 12 June .
It has divided the clergy in Qom , the leading political conservative or principalist actors in Tehran and the state institutions .
It forced the supreme leader to side with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at a great cost to his own position and the ruling clergy , undermining the very agreed consensus among the top officials .
Statements issued by losing candidates Mehdi Karroubi and Mir Hossein Mousavi are a sad reflections of the Iranian reality couched in the language of hope for millions who are waiting in expectation that something might be done .
"" Not all is lost "" is the core of their messages .
Both candidates are frank about the difficult predicaments they are in , and yet they want to keep the newly formed opposition movement united and act within the law .
They want their supporters to use every opportunity to express their disapproval of what they consider an illegitimate government .
By emphatically saying all is not lost , it seems that they are banking on creating a democratic movement based on the constitution and preparing the ground for the next election , or for a time the ruling bloc exhaust itself with its radical policies .
The pragmatics among the conservatives are concerned about the handling of the election by the Guardian Council and the supreme leader 's office . ""
Ahmadinejad pulled wool over the supreme leader 's eyes "" a leading conservative clergy is quoted as saying .
Mousavi may well be banking on the fact that the conservatives would soon start to fight each other , as has been the case the in the past .
Some may see this as a pious hope .
The election has also brought to light the depth of maturity in Iran 's civil society : calm , rational and pragmatic about change .
Would the civil society keep its hope alive , or would it turn into a cynical , demoralised and depoliticised mass ?
This is the danger for Mousavi , Karroubi and Mohammad Khatami , the former president .
That is why they are threading a fine line between remaining loyal to the constitution and at the same time containing the radicalisation of a movement that no longer wants to take the supremacy of the clergy for granted .
Mousavi made an interesting remark in his statement that illustrate the dynamism of the Iranian situation : "" At the beginning , the objective for us all in participating in the election was to bring back religious rationalism to the management of the country , but en route we were guided towards higher objectives . ""
He goes on to conclude : "" The rulers will have to understand that peoples ' votes and will are above them all , which they no longer can ignore . """
2009-07-01,"Mir Hossein Mousavi declared today that he considered the new government "" illegitimate "" , two weeks after he was defeated by the incumbent , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , in Iran 's disputed presidential election .
In a statement posted on his website the moderate leader also called for the release of detained "" children of the revolution "" – a reference to the scores of reformist figures arrested since the 12 June poll .
The language seemed deliberately chosen to suggest that the regime was betraying the principles of 1979 .
"" It is our historical responsibility to continue our protests and not to abandon our efforts to preserve the nation 's rights , "" he said .
Mousavi , under pressure from the authorities , has not appeared in public for several days , so the statement constitutes a direct challenge to the regime .
He also called for the lifting of a ban on moderate newspapers and websites , which have been subject to a harsh crackdown .
Earlier this week he urged supporters to continue peaceful protests after the guardian council ignored his call for new elections , ruling that there had been no "" major irregularities "" after a partial recount .
Basij militia leaders have reportedly asked Iran 's chief prosecutor to investigate Mousavi for his role in the protests .
In a letter to the country 's chief prosecutor , the Basij accuse Mousavi of involvement in nine offences against the state , including "" disturbing the nation 's security "" .
That charge carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence .
The letter came as Ahmadinejad cancelled a planned trip to Libya without explanation .
The last - minute cancellation is being seen as a sign of the continuing volatility in Iran as the authorities struggle with the fallout from last month 's disputed election , in which Ahmadinejad was declared the winner .
One of the other candidates , Mehdi Karroubi , a reformist cleric , vowed to continue his fight to annul the election despite the endorsement of the poll by the powerful guardian council after a partial recount of the vote .
"" I do n't consider this government legitimate , "" Karroubi said on his website .
It was later reported that the daily Etemad - e - Melli , a newspaper allied to him , had been closed down .
In his statement Karroubi also demanded the release of "" thousands "" of people arrested during the unrest .
Iran 's police chief , Brigadier General Ismail Ahmadi - Moghaddam , said 1,032 people had been arrested since the 12 June election , but he claimed that most had since been released .
"" Those who are still in detention were referred to the public and revolutionary courts in Tehran , "" Fars News Agency quoted him as saying , according to Reuters .
Ahmadi - Moghaddam said 20 "" rioters "" had been killed during the unrest and more than 500 police had been injured .
He also asked Interpol to arrest Arash Hejazi , the doctor who was filmed coming to the aid of Neda Soltan after she was shot in the widely seen video of her death .
Hejazi fled to London after the incident and suggested that a Basij militiaman on a motorbike was responsible for her killing . ""
Her killing was a planned scenario and had no relation with the riots in Tehran , "" Ahmadi - Moghaddam said ."

"" It is our historical responsibility to continue our protests and not to abandon our efforts to preserve the nation 's rights , "" insisted the former prime minister .
"" From now on we will have a government which from the point of view of ties with the public is in the weakest of positions .
A majority of society , of which I personally am a member , do not accept the legitimacy of this government . ""
Mousavi also demanded an end to the regime 's "" obsession "" with security , the reform of electoral laws he believes were abused , the constitutional right to free political assembly , an end to restrictions on the media , and the right to set up independent television stations .
It was his first public statement since Monday 's final certification by the guardian council – Iran 's top legislative body – that there had been no "" major irregularities "" in the election after a partial recount , despite widespread complaints and suspicions of vote - rigging .
Mousavi quickly won heavyweight support from Iran 's former reformist president , Mohammed Khatami , who decried what he called a "" velvet coup against democracy "" – a mirror image of the charge by the regime that foreign powers such as Britain and the US are pushing for a "" velvet revolution "" in the country .
"" People 's protests were suppressed , those who were required to protect people 's rights humiliated the people … yet it [ the government ] speaks of national reconciliation and peace , "" said Khatami .
Mehdi Karoubi , the other reformist presidential candidate , said on his website : "" I do n't consider this government legitimate .

Analysts said the reformists were seeking to set the tone for the future and keep the hopes of their supporters alive despite the election result and subsequent crackdown .
"" They want to turn opposition activity into a civil society movement that operates within the law , "" said Baqer Moin , biographer of Ayatollah Khomeini .
"" This means there will be a collective reformist effort to prepare for the next election , undermining Ahmadinejad and warning the leadership that the Islamic Republic will lose the confidence of the people .

2009-07-04,"The stakes over Iran 's disputed presidential election were raised dramatically yesterday , after a powerful regime hardliner denounced Mir Hossein Mousavi , the candidate officially declared to have lost , as an American agent and demanded that he undergo a public trial .
Hossein Shariatmadari , editor - in - chief of the influential Kayhan newspaper , said Mousavi had committed "" terrible crimes "" , including "" murdering innocent people , holding riots , co - operating with foreigners and acting as America 's fifth column "" , in pursuing his claims that last month 's re - election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was rigged .
The accusations - in a newspaper editorial - were the most ferocious yet from regime insiders and may serve notice that preparations are under way to arrest Mousavi and his main allies .
Several hundred known reformists and pro - Mousavi supporters have already been detained since the election .
The editorial also singled out the reformist former president , Mohammad Khatami , who last week compared Ahmadinejad 's re - election to a coup . ""
An open court , in front of the people 's eyes , must deal with the all the terrible crimes and clear betrayal committed by the main elements behind the recent unrest , including Mousavi and Khatami , "" Shariatmadari wrote .
"" Documents and undeniable evidence show that this mission was directed from the outside .
All they did and said was in line with the instructions announced by American officials in the past . "" The editorial carried added weight given Shariatmadari 's position as confidant to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has declared the election result legitimate and called for protests to end .
Shariatmadari has been called "" the aggressive public face "" of Khamenei , who appointed him to his current position .
His outburst fits with the regime 's strategy of depicting the demonstrations against Ahmadinejad 's re - election as orchestrated by foreign governments , including Britain .
It came a day after a Khamenei ally , Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati , head of the Guardian Council , said at Friday prayers that Iranian employees of the British embassy in Tehran would be tried after they had "" confessed "" to helping to organise the protests .
Two employees are still in custody at Tehran 's Evin prison following last weekend 's arrest of nine Iranian members of staff .
Iran has accused the embassy staff of stirring up the unrest after Khamenei last month lambasted Britain as the "" most evil "" of Iran 's enemies .
One of the detained , Hossein Rassam , 44 , the embassy 's chief political analyst , has been charged with "" acting against national security "" , a catch - all accusation often levelled against political activists .
His lawyer , Abdolsamad Khorramshahi , has said he expects him to stand trial .
On Friday the EU summoned all Iranian ambassadors to its 27 member states to receive formal protests over the threat to try the employees .
The call for Mousavi to stand trial follows a similar demand last week by the Basij , a hardline volunteer force loyal to Ahmadinejad , which lodged a formal complaint against him .
Reformist leaders have continued to voice defiance after last week 's declaration by the Guardian Council that the results were final and the poll Iran 's "" healthiest "" since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
The government has said 20 people died in clashes between demonstrators and security forces since the election on 12 June , although other estimates put the death toll much higher .
While street protests have subsided following heavy deployment of security forces , Mousavi has continued to question the election and has urged his supporters not to lose heart .
Last week he openly described Ahmadinejad 's government as "" illegitimate "" and vowed that protests would carry on . ""
A majority of the people , including me , do not accept ( the government 's ) political legitimacy , "" he said on his website .
"" It is our historical responsibility to continue our protests and not to abandon our efforts to preserve the nation 's rights .
A ruling system that relied on people 's trust for 30 years can not replace this with security forces overnight .
"" Leading clerics in the shrine city of Qom , the home of Iran 's religious establishment , have echoed his criticisms - illustrating the depth of the split that now exists at the heart of the theocratic regime .
The pro - reform association of Qom theological schools and lecturers has also questioned the election . ""
Can a government produced by all these massive electoral violations be considered legitimate ?
"" it asked on its website yesterday ."
2009-07-05,"Deepening splits among Iran 's clergy came to the surface today , with a senior clerical group calling Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's re - election "" illegitimate "" .
The Assembly of Scholars and Researchers at Qom seminary , the centre of Shia learning in Iran , rejected the official results and called for the release of political prisoners . ""
Other candidates ' complaints and strong evidence of vote - rigging were ignored … peaceful protests by Iranians were violently oppressed … dozens of Iranians were killed and hundreds were illegally arrested , "" a statement on its website said .
"" The outcome is invalid . ""
It also questioned the credibility of the guardian council , the conservative clerics who said the elections were free and fair .
The Qom group said the council no longer had the right "" to judge in this case "" and that some members had "" lost their impartial image in the eyes of the public "" .
The Qom assembly is a pro - reform group with limited political influence , but the statement is important as it represents an open challenge to the authority of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who declared Ahmadinejad the winner and ordered an end to debate on the result .
Protests have been quashed with force and mass arrests .
The head of Iran 's judiciary , Ayatollah Mahmoud Shahroudi , said yesterday that the clampdown would be extended to satellite TV and internet networks .
At the same time , the regime made some concessions to international pressure , releasing the eighth of nine British embassy employees detained last month , along with Iason Athanasiadis , a journalist with dual British and Greek nationality .
The embassy employee was not named , but is an Iranian citizen like all the staff picked up after the protests .
The only remaining embassy detainee is Hossein Rassam , a respected political analyst who has been told he will face trial on charges of harming national security .
Rassam 's lawyer said he had not been allowed to visit him in prison or read the charges .
The foreign secretary , David Miliband , said yesterday that Rassam was "" an honourable , patriotic Iranian , who has been working in a completely open and transparent way for the UK "" . ""
The allegations of improper conduct have absolutely no basis , "" Miliband told the BBC .
"" I think it is very , very important that we send a clear message that we are confident about the way he has been doing his job [ and ] that we are clear about our goal , which is his release , unharmed . ""
General Ismail Ahmadi - Moghaddam , the chief of police , said two - thirds of the arrested demonstrators had been released , some on bail .
He said about 1,000 were arrested , but human rights groups say up to 2,000 dissidents are being held .
"" How should the Islamic Republic treat such groups ?
They would be a dangerous opposition if they were to win , and set the streets on fire if they lose , "" the conservative newspaper Keyhan said in an editorial ."
2009-07-05,"Iran has said it will release the eighth of nine British embassy employees detained in Tehran , David Miliband revealed today .
The foreign secretary said he would continue to fight for the release of the remaining detainee , who is facing a possible trial on charges that had "" absolutely no substance "" .
The staff were arrested last weekend amid rapidly deteriorating relations between Britain and Iran since the disputed re - election of the incumbent president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and the street protests that followed .
"" I spoke to our ambassador on our daily call last night , and the good news is that he was told by the deputy foreign minister that the eighth person would indeed be released today , that the papers have been signed and that there would not be a court process or charges , "" Miliband said on BBC1 's Andrew Marr Show .
In a separate development , Iranian TV today reported that a Greek journalist with joint British nationality had been released .
Iason Athanasiadis - Fowden , a freelance reporter who was covering last month 's presidential elections for the Washington Times , was arrested last month . ""
Because of the humanitarian efforts made by Iran 's envoy to Greece ... the Greek journalist was released today , "" Hassan Qashqavi , a foreign ministry spokesman , told state television .
In another development , the Association of Researchers and Teachers of Qom , an influential group of religious leaders in Iran , was today reported to have called the new government illegitimate . ""
This crack in the clerical establishment , and the fact they are siding with the people and [ reformist candidate Mir Hussein ] Mousavi , in my view is the most historic crack in the 30 years of the Islamic Republic , "" Abbas Milani , director of Iranian studies at Stanford University , told the New York Times .
The group from Qom , a city known as a centre of scholarship , issued a statement last week in support of Mousavi .
The statement urged religious leaders to back his supporters and "" oppose oppressors and aid oppressed "" people .
The ninth British embassy worker , who remains in detention , is the chief political analyst , Hossein Rassam , an Iranian citizen , his lawyer , Abdolsamad Khorramshahi , said .
The 44-year - old has been charged with "" acting against national security "" , a catch - all accusation often levelled against political activists .
Khorramshahi said he expects him to stand trial .
Miliband said he felt "" cold anger "" about the treatment of the embassy staff , who are all Iranian . ""
The allegations of improper conduct have absolutely no basis , "" he said , describing the last detainee was "" an honourable , patriotic Iranian , who has been working in a completely open and transparent way for the UK "" .
"" I think it is very , very important that we send a clear message that we are confident about the way he has been doing his job , that we are clear about our goal , which is his release , unharmed and also that there is unity across the international community , he added .
"" What 's important is that I turn my anger into determination to see that justice is done by our people . ""
Iran has accused the embassy staff of stirring up unrest after the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , described Britain as the "" most evil "" of Iran 's enemies last month .
The EU summoned all Iranian ambassadors to its 27 member states to receive formal protests on Friday over the threat to try the employees ."
2009-07-07,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad delivered an uncompromising riposte to questions over his political legitimacy tonight by casting his re - election as a democratic triumph and mocking his opponents for failing to provide evidence to support their claims of fraud .
His appearance came hours after Iran 's opposition movement took another step towards concerted action with a defiant call from Mir Hossein Mousavi , the defeated presidential candidate , for the release of all those detained in the country 's post - election unrest .
Mousavi was backed by fellow candidate Mehdi Karoubi as well as the reformist former president Mohammad Khatami in a statement posted on his website .
In a live address on state television , Ahmadinejad made scant reference to the bitter divisions and mass demonstrations provoked by his disputed victory .
Instead , he said "" some "" Iranians had collaborated with foreign powers in trying to sully what he portrayed as a glorious episode . ""
They did n't provide even one piece of documentary evidence regarding irregularity or vote fraud , "" said Ahmadinejad .
Responding to accusations of mass cheating , he said the June 12 poll had been monitored by ordinary people such as teachers and workers .
The interior ministry , accused of masterminding a rigged poll , played only a "" supporting role "" .
He trumpeted the 85 % turnout as the "" highest rate of democracy "" and claimed the election had been "" the most free of its kind "" because it allowed candidates open criticism , televised debates and access to state media .
The mandate supplied by his re - election would be used to tread his chosen path "" more powerfully than before "" , he said .
Ahmadinejad made just one passing reference to the street protests and clashes with government forces that left at least 20 people dead .
Sticking to the regime 's official line , he said these had been orchestrated by "" arrogant powers "" – code often used by Iranian officials to mean Britain and the US . ""
They wanted to reduce the power that we gained from this election and some people unfortunately collaborated with them , "" he said .
His rosy picture of mass support for his cause jarred with a chorus of criticism from an increasing range of sources , including clerical groups , that doubts over the election and the violent clampdown that followed have left his government without democratic legitimacy .
The abiding sentiment was reflected in attempts by opponents to sabotage his appearance by encouraging acts of civil disobedience .
The internet and Twitter were rife with messages calling on Iranians to switch on all their electrical appliances to coincide with his address in an effort to overload the national power grid .
Zahra Rahnavard , Mousavi 's wife , left a message on her Facebook page calling on supporters to take to their roofs and shout "" Allahu Akbar "" during Ahmadinejad 's appearance .
The opposition leaders had earlier demanded an end to the "" super - security state "" imposed since the election and called for the release of opposition figures and journalists .
Iranian police say they have detained more than 1,000 political activists , journalists and protesters during demonstrations since the "" stolen "" election on June 12 .
Officials say most have been released , but reliable figures are not available .
"" If a modicum of wisdom had been used , and if lies and disrespect had been avoided , this issue would not have turned into a national crisis , "" the opposition leaders said .
"" The continuation of arrests and the imposed security state will lead to a more radicalised political atmosphere . ""
In France , President Nicolas Sarkozy demanded the release of a young French academic detained after taking photos of Iranian protests and accused of espionage .
Clotilde Reiss , 23 , was arrested last week at Tehran 's airport .
"" These accusations of espionage are high fantasy , "" he said .
Mousavi vowed to continue his resistance despite the crackdown and has hinted that he will change tack away from public protests to instead form a new political party .
Defying the official crackdown , opposition activists called for a mass turnout all over the country on Thursday to mark the 10th anniversary of the student demonstrations in 1999 .
Mousavi supporters are planning rallies at multiple sites , apparently hoping to present the security forces with more targets than they can handle ."
2009-07-08,"Iran 's domestic crisis in the aftermath of June 's disputed presidential election has dominated world headlines in recent weeks .
But as the dust settles it is the international dimension of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's second term – and especially the future of the Islamic republic 's nuclear programme – that is concentrating minds in the US , Europe and Israel .
The US vice - president , Joe Biden , made the point bluntly last weekend when he repeated Barack Obama 's offer to negotiate with Tehran on the nuclear issue , despite Washington 's condemnation of the post - election crackdown .
But when asked about Israel 's position , Biden 's ( presumably careful ) answer was that the US "" can not dictate to another sovereign nation what they can and can not do "" .
Conventional wisdom has it that George Bush made clear in the final months of his presidency that he would not give Israel a "" green light "" to carry out a repeat of its 1981 attack on Iraq 's Osirak nuclear reactor .
Biden 's message was no green light either – as his boss clarified very firmly to CNN on Tuesday .
But it was surely intended as a reminder that an Israeli raid on Iran remains possible ( even if Biden declined to say whether the US would allow Israel to overfly Iraq , or supply it with radar identification codes , refuelling and electronic warfare assistance ) .
The US military has certainly made no secret of its view that any Israeli action would be hugely "" destabilising "" in the light of American commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Intriguingly , the latest comments from the White House followed confirmation that an Israeli submarine , armed with cruise missiles , passed through the Suez Canal recently to take part in exercises in the Red Sea . ""
Egyptian permission for Israeli submarines and other vessels to go through the canal shortens the timetables required for Israel to effectively deploy its long - distance strategic arm … to carry out deterrence missions in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean , "" observed the veteran Israeli military analyst Ron Ben - Yishai .
The unspoken assumption is that such missiles could deliver warheads from Israel 's undeclared but formidable nuclear arsenal .
The spin from Israel is that both sides wanted to demonstrate co - ordination in the face of the Iranian threat .
Cairo refused to confirm the report .
But President Hosni Mubarak 's hostility to Tehran is no secret .
And Biden 's interview coincided with a report that Israel had secretly secured agreement from Saudi Arabia to turn a blind eye to any attack on Iranian nuclear sites .
( Israeli planes are said to fly regularly through Saudi airspace , leaving behind the fuel drop - tanks with Hebrew markings just to make sure they are noticed . )
Immediate denials from Israel and Riyadh will have done little to dispel the probably deliberate impression that an attack is still on the cards , especially now that Ahmadinejad is going to be president for four more years .
In the words of Aluf Benn , the Ha'aretz analyst : "" Israeli officials argue that Iran 's apparently fraudulent election and its brutal suppression of the subsequent demonstrations reveal the pointlessness of talking with Tehran and the need for stiffer sanctions .
The statements of the last few days are meant to bolster this message with hints of possible military action .
"" Israel has also let it be known that it is lobbying hard to prevent Iran acquiring advanced "" game - changing "" Russian - made S-300 air defence missiles that could impede any air assault .
Obama reportedly told Binyamin Netanyahu in May that if there was no progress on the Iranian nuclear file by the end of 2010 his administration would turn to other steps , including tougher sanctions – being discussed by G8 leaders at this week 's summit in Italy .
On Saturday the president made the issue sound even more immediate , speaking of making assessments in the "" coming weeks and months "" .
Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff , described a "" very narrow window "" before Iran went nuclear .
This emphasis is striking because while there is general agreement in the west that Iran is close to enriching enough uranium for a weapon , the timing is unclear .
In Israel , which western governments suspect of exaggerating the danger from Tehran , the Mossad chief , Meir Dagan , last month put back his estimate of when Iran could acquire a bomb to 2014 .
Revealingly , he also told MPs that Israel would have an easier time explaining the threat of Iranian nuclear weapons to the world when the country is led by Ahmadinejad than by the defeated moderate Mir Hossein Mousavi ( a view warmly embraced in Washington by the hawkish John Bolton , a former senior official in the Bush administration ) .
And Dagan , Israeli analysts note , has just had his tenure extended for a near - record eighth year , fuelling speculation that the man who ( probably ) organised attacks on Syria 's alleged nuclear reactor , a Hamas arms convoy in distant Sudan , as well as the Damascus assassination of Hizbullah 's Imad Mughniyeh , might have some other tricks up his sleeve .
( Hard evidence of Iranian capabilities , if any exists , remains secret .
But the cautious Mohammed ElBaradei , the outgoing head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , spoke last month of his "" gut feeling "" that Iran was indeed seeking the ability to produce nuclear arms , if it desired , as an "" insurance policy "" against perceived threats . )
Predictions remain divided : one is that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the hardliners will need to demonstrate their toughness in the face of western pressure and Israeli threats .
"" Everyone is waiting to see what will come out of this , but while we 're waiting , while we 're watching , the [ nuclear ] clock is ticking , "" Israel 's ambassador in Washington , Michael Oren , told the US .
Another scenario , discussed in Gulf countries , is that Tehran may be forced into concessions internationally to assuage opposition anger at home , especially over the economy .
It is too soon to say which view is correct .
But it is already clear that the nuclear file , rather than electoral fraud or democracy , is once again the key problem in Iran 's troubled ties with the wider world ."
2009-07-16,"The man in charge of Iran 's nuclear programme has resigned amid signs that his departure is linked to political turmoil following last month 's presidential election .
The semi - official ISNA news agency reported that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had accepted the resignation of Gholamreza Aghazadeh , the veteran head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran ( AEOI ) and the country 's vice - president for atomic energy .
No details were given of why the man described as the father of Iran 's nuclear programme had stepped down , but there were suggestions it may have been for political reasons .
Aghazadeh has worked closely in the past with Mir Hossein Mousavi , who claims that he and not Ahmadinejad won the 12 June presidential election .
Iran insists its nuclear programme is for civilian power generation .
But the US , Europe and Israel all fear it is aimed at producing atomic bombs .
Aghazadeh 's position has been likened to that of AQ Khan , the architect of Pakistan 's nuclear programme .
"" Aghazadeh 's resignation is a big deal , "" said Mark Fitzpatrick , a proliferation expert at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London .
"" The signs are that it had something to do with the post - election turmoil and that he was aligned with Mousavi 's camp .
He brought a strong management discipline to the Iranian programme .
Under his predecessor the [ uranium ] enrichment programme had been floundering .
Progress had been stop and go .
"" Everything in Iran is in flux right now , but I do n't expect the nuclear programme will change direction . ""
In the 80s Aghazadeh worked as a deputy to Mousavi , first in the foreign ministry and then the prime minister 's office .
This year Aghazadeh announced advances in manufacturing centrifuges , a key component of the enrichment programme .
According to the UN nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , Iran has nearly 5,000 centrifuges currently enriching uranium and 2,000 others ready to start .
Aghazadeh is not known to have been involved in Iran 's negotiations with the west over its nuclear programme , on which key decisions are taken by the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Aghazadeh , 62 , studied in the US before the 1979 revolution , later serving under Mousavi .
He was minister of petroleum from 1985 to 1997 , when he moved to the AEOI during the presidency of the reformist Mohammad Khatami – who openly backs Mousavi .
Ephraim Asculai , a nuclear expert at Israel 's Institute for National Security Studies , said : "" Aghazadeh has been successful in his work at a technical level . """
2009-07-16,"It 's a long way from Tehran to Zahedan , in Iran 's remote south - east , but the hanging of 13 convicted terrorists this week sent out a chilling message about the readiness of the Islamic Republic to act ruthlessly to defend its core interests .
On the face of it , there was no link between the mass execution and last month 's disputed presidential election , in which Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won a second term .
But these and other recent judicial killings may be designed to intimidate at a time of unprecedented unrest and uncertainty about Iran 's future .
The 13 men who mounted the gallows early on Tuesday morning were not supporters of Mir Hossein Mousavi , officially defeated by Ahmadinejad , but members of Jundullah ( Soldiers of God ) , a small Sunni rebel group .
The worst of its attacks was the suicide bombing of a Shia mosque in May , which killed 25 people in Zahedan , the capital of Sistan - Baluchestan province , which has a Sunni majority .
Jundullah claims to be fighting for the rights of Iran 's Baluch minority but is often linked by the regime in Tehran to al - Qaida , and to the west .
It has been blamed for drug smuggling , kidnapping and attacks on civilians and revolutionary guards and appears to be based across the border in Pakistani Baluchistan .
Iranian media quoted one of the condemned men as "" confessing "" that the group was trained and financed by "" the US and Zionists "" .
The hangings were to have beenin a public park but in the end took place inside a prison compound .
A 14th man , the brother of the group 's leader , Abdulmalik Rigi , was given a brief stay of execution - but only to allow him to undergo further questioning .
The charges , in the inimitably stark language of Iranian Islamic justice , included moharebeh - "" enmity against God "" as well as being "" corrupt on earth , killing innocent people and taking hostages while carrying firearms .
"" Capital punishment is common in Iran .
It is second only to China in the number of executions carried out each year ( and leads the world in executing juveniles ) .
Tehran regularly ignores calls by Amnesty International and other human rights groups to desist .
Late last month , 20 drug traffickers were hanged en masse in Karaj , west of Tehran .
In all , at least 177 people have been executed so far this year , compared to 246 in 2008 .
Analysts believe this spate of executions is meant to assert the regime 's authority amid the worst unrest Iran has seen since the 1979 revolution .
Official figures say 20 people have been killed since polling day on 12 June , though unofficial estimates put it at between 60 and 100 .
Still , forecasts of a Tiananmen - style crackdown have not materialised , with the authorities apparently understanding that mass bloodshed only fuels popular anger .
But intimidation – the creation of a Saddam - style "" republic of fear""– is a different matter .
It is a central theme of the regime 's narrative that the post - election trouble has been fomented by foreigners , with Britain and the BBC ( whose new Farsi TV service is especially disliked ) singled out for blame .
It is a measure of how bad things look from Tehran that Mohsen Rezaei , the former commander of the revolutionary guard - and , alongside Ahmadinejad , the other conservative presidential candidate - warned on Monday that the republic was in danger of collapse . ""
The US and Israel plotted this disintegration to weaken Iran and make it surrender through sanctions or attack , "" Rezaei said .
Iranian state media also routinely accuse western governments of backing terrorists .
Usually the subject of such accusations is the banned Peoples Mojahedin , supported by Iraq during the Saddam Hussein years .
Jundullah is presented as another example : "" Clear confessions made by the defendants show that they and their commander are directly supported by the US and receive military , educational and financial aid from the USA , "" local TV reported .
The interior minister , Sadegh Mahsouli , – an Ahmadinejad trusty – had no hesitation in blaming "" Americans and Israelis , not Sunnis or Shias "" for the Zahedan mosque bombing .
Claims by American journalist Seymour Hersh and others about CIA support for Iranian Kurds , Arabs – and Baluchs – have made a far stronger impression in Tehran than repeated denials from Washington .
In a country where only half the 70 million population are Persian , anything that is perceived to encourage ethnic unrest or separatism is deeply suspect .
No wonder there was fury when Rigi , Jundullah 's leader , was interviewed on the ( government - run ) Voice of America in 2007 and described as the leader of a "" popular resistance movement "" .
Barack Obama , "" reaching out "" to Tehran at least before the election , has not repudiated a reported Bush administration covert programme to destabilise Iran , although as it was supposed to be secret
it is possible he may have done so without announcing the change .
The incidents of recent weeks are reminiscent of a similar outbreak of violence before the last presidential poll in 2005 .
Then bombs hit Tehran and the south - western city of Ahvaz , capital of Khuzestan , which has a big Arab minority , killing eight and wounding dozens .
Against such a volatile backdrop , further angry claims of external meddling seem likely from Iran . ""
A government with domestic legitimacy problems will always seek a foreign crisis , "" said Ali Ansari , an Iran expert at St Andrews University .
"" The ethnic element will be utilised more as the government plays the security card . """
2009-07-17,"President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has appointed a US - educated scientist , Ali Akbar Salehi , to head the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran in place of Gholam Reza Aghazadeh , who resigned after 12 years , possibly for reasons linked to the country 's post - election unrest .
Salehi served as Iran 's representative to the UN 's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency , and is described as "" a mild - mannered politician "" who favours resolving Iran 's bitter nuclear dispute with the west through talks .
Analysts have cited his experience at the IAEA – under the presidency of the reformist Mohammad Khatami – as enabling him to build trust with the outside world on this most sensitive of issues .
No negotiations are currently taking place .
Salehi signed the IAEA 's "" additional protocol "" in 2003 as a confidence - building measure .
That requires member states to provide an expanded declaration of nuclear activities and grants the agency broader rights of access to nuclear sites .
But Iran 's parliament refused to ratify it in protest at attempts to make permanent Iran 's voluntary and temporary suspension of uranium enrichment .
It is unclear whether Salehi will have any influence on future nuclear talks .
Aghazadeh was not involved in them , while the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has the last word on key issues .
Salehi 's appointment is one of the "" considerable changes "" Ahmadinejad has said he plans to make .
Yesterday he pledged that his new cabinet would be "" 10 times "" as powerful as the previous one .
Ahmadinejad also promoted his son - in - law , Rahim Mashaie , to senior vice - president .
Intriguingly , Mashaie was embroiled in controversy last year for making positive comments about Israel , normally the target of venomous attacks by Tehran .
Salehi has also been president of Tehran 's prestigious Sharif University of Technology and has a PhD in technical science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) .
It is widely assumed that Aghazadeh 's resignation was linked to his long friendship with Mir Hossein Mousavi , who claims that he , not Ahmadinejad , won the June 12 election ."
2009-07-17,"Iranian riot police used batons and teargas today to break up defiant protests after prayers in Tehran , where Hashemi Rafsanjani , one of the country 's most powerful clerics , warned that the regime was "" in crisis "" and urged a release of prisoners detained in post - election unrest .
Rafsanjani , a bitter rival of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , broke his month - long silence to issue a stark warning that the Islamic Republic had lost popular support .
His carefully crafted address stopped short of directly attacking Khamenei or Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , whose victory in June 's presidential poll has been widely denounced as a fraud .
But its message was still strong . ""
Today is a bitter day , "" Rafsanjani declared from the pulpit at Tehran University 's sprawling prayer ground .
"" People have lost their faith in the regime and their trust is damaged .
It 's necessary to regain people 's consent and restore their trust in the regime .
Everyone has lost . ""
Mir Hossein Mousavi , the moderate former prime minister who says he won the election , sat in the front row with other VIPs as Rafsanjani spoke .
Mehdi Karoubi , a reformist cleric who was also a candidate , was there too — and was jostled by thugs afterwards .
Mousavi and Karoubi both insist the Ahmadinejad government is illegitimate .
Khamenei has publicly backed the incumbent , hoping to see off the biggest challenge to the regime since the Iranian revolution 30 years ago .
Tens of thousands of Mousavi supporters , many wearing the green wristbands that became the symbol of his election campaign , packed the prayer ground , the stage for a peculiarly Iranian combination of religion and politics , prayer and agitprop .
Rafsanjani 's first sermon since the disputed election was keenly awaited but was not broadcast on state TV .
Foreign media access is now severely restricted .
The mobile phone network was again completely blocked to disrupt communications between demonstrators .
"" Doubt has been created [ about the results ] , "" Rafsanjani said .
"" There is a large portion of wise people who say they have doubts .
We need to take action to remove this doubt .
Where people are not present or their vote is not considered , that government is not Islamic . ""
This passage needed little decoding : Khamenei and the guardian council , a clerical body which supervises elections , have declared the contest free and fair , dashing hopes of a re - run .
Still , Rafsanjani – often accused of sitting on the fence – did not call outright for an annulment .
His words were repeatedly interrupted by slogans from the rival camps as well as by whiffs of teargas fired by security forces and which drifted in from the surrounding streets .
Hardliners chanted the traditional "" death to America "" while opposition supporters countered with azadi ( freedom ) as well as "" death to Russia "" – a reference to the government 's ties to Moscow .
The chanting died away only after the speaker urged the crowd "" not to contaminate the position and the sanctuary of Friday prayers "" .
Rafsanjani wept as he spoke of prisoners , and of the Prophet Muhammad as one who brought justice , and a man who "" protected the rights of all those under his rule "" – more thinly - veiled criticism of the government . ""
Rafsanjani 's main message was for Ayatollah Khamenei , "" said the analyst Baqer Moin . ""
Rafsanjani wanted to tell him , ' You 'd better be humble and try to find a way out of the current crisis . '
"" The crowd at Friday prayers is usually made up extremely conservative government loyalists .
But many Mousavi supporters were young women wearing the loose hijab head - covering shunned by the devout .
Some had green - painted fingernails .
"" This was not a normal Friday prayer , "" said Fariba , a 24-year - old student .
"" The regime has killed people and we have got more united .
They have not silenced us .
Ironically , I thank Ahmadinejad for making us unite against him . ""
The crackdown on the media was only partially effective .
An unprecedented number of videos posted on YouTube on a single day showed masked protesters starting fires in the streets , or handing out flowers to policemen .
Teargas was fired at Mousavi supporters on their way to prayer but clashes with police and basij militia intensified afterwards .
At least 20 people were arrested , witnesses said .
Among those detained was Shadi Sadr , the prominent women 's activist and human rights lawyer ."
2009-07-19,"The Iranian army has arrested 36 officers who planned to attend last week 's Friday prayer sermon by former president Hashemi Rafsanjani in their military uniforms as an act of political defiance , according to Farsi - language websites .
The officers intended the gesture to show solidarity with the demonstrations against last month 's presidential election result , which was won by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad but which has been clouded by allegations of mass fraud .
Rafsanjani used the sermon at Tehran university to challenge the authority of Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , by questioning the result in the presence of the defeated reformist candidate , Mir Hossein Mousavi , and tens of thousands of his supporters .
Security forces used teargas and arrested dozens of those in attendance in a sign of the authorities ' nervousness over the event .
The officers were rounded up on Friday morning by army intelligence agents who had caught wind of the plan .
They are said to have been arrested at their homes and taken to an unknown location .
Peiknet , a Farsi website , said the officers had agreed the action at a weekly prayer meeting the night before at the Shah Abdolazim religious shrine in Shahr - e Rey , on Tehran 's southern outskirts .
"" They decided to attend the Friday prayer in their military clothes as a sign of protest against the cruel massacre of people by the basij and revolutionary guards and to show their objection against this process and support for the people , "" the site said .
It named 24 of the officers , who included two majors , four captains , eight lieutenants , six sergeants and four warrant officers .
The arrests expose the authorities ' sensitivity to signs of mutiny among the various branches of the security forces .
Reports last month suggested that a senior revolutionary guard commander , General Ali Fazli , had been arrested for refusing to obey orders to suppress protests against election result .
The reports were later denied but some sources say Fazli remains under pressure to toe the line .
While the army is considered to be secondary in importance to the revolutionary guards in the regime 's military hierarchy , it is still under the command of Khamenei , who yesterday appointed a cleric , Hojatoleslam Mohammad Ali Al - e Hashem , as the new head of its political ideology section .
Khamenei has declared the election result fair and overseen a fierce crackdown that has led to at least 2,000 arrests and a death toll the government puts at 20 but which some human rights groups say could be in the hundreds ."
2009-07-20,"Iran 's supreme leader , Ali Khamenei , warned today that continuing divisions would lead to the collapse of the country 's ruling elite , after a former president called for a referendum on the government 's legitimacy .
The referendum call from Mohammad Khatami appeared to be part of an opposition strategy to keep Khamenei and allied hardliners on the defensive over last month 's disputed elections .
It coincided with a demand from Mir Hossein Mousavi , the leading opposition candidate in those elections , for the release of opposition supporters detained for protesting against the official results , which gave a landslide victory to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Another former president , Hashemi Rafsanjani , gave a speech at Friday prayers in which he said the Islamic Republic was in crisis and the government had lost the trust of millions of Iranians .
Khamenei , whose previously unquestioned authority is now under daily challenge , hit back furiously .
"" The elite should be watchful , since they have been faced with a big test .
Failing the test will cause their collapse , "" the supreme leader said , in a speech to mark a religious holiday , attended by government officials including Ahmadinejad , who sat on the stage behind him .
Khatami 's call for a referendum represented a new tactic by the opposition , in its efforts to maintain the momentum of a protest movement harshly suppressed on the streets by pro - government militias .
"" I state openly that reliance upon the people 's vote and the staging of a legal referendum is the only way for the system to emerge from the current crisis , "" said Khatami , a reformist cleric who was president from 1997 to 2005 .
"" People must be asked whether they are happy with the situation that has taken shape . ""
In remarks quoted on reformist Iranian websites , he suggested a referendum be overseen by an "" impartial "" body , such as the Expediency Discernment Council , which is chaired by Rafsanjani and is supposed to mediate disputes between clerical and lay organs of state .
Khatami 's political organisation , the Association of Combatant Clerics , issued a statement on its website saying that a referendum should not be overseen by "" bodies and centres that manipulated "" the 12 June vote , a reference to the Guardian Council , a body that oversees elections and endorsed the official election result .
It is highly unlikely that either Khamenei or the Guardian Council would agree to such a referendum .
It appeared to designed principally to open a new avenue of attack on the conservative establishment .
Mousavi also raised his own rallying cry to supporters at a meeting with the families of post - election detainees .
"" You are facing something new : an awakened nation , a nation that has been born again and is here to defend its achievements , "" the former prime minister said .
"" Arrests ... wo n't put an end to this problem .
End this game as soon as possible and return to the nation its [ arrested ] sons.""Mousavi ridiculed the accusation repeatedly made by Khamenei and his allies that the protests were the product of foreign orchestration . ""
Who believes that [ the protesters ] would conspire with foreigners and sell the interests of their own country ?
Has our country become so mean and degraded that you attribute the huge protest movement of the nation to foreigners ?
Is n't this an insult to our nation ? ""
Mousavi said .
Amid the uncompromising rhetoric on both sides , the government appeared to make a small concessionary gesture , allowing detainees to call their families from prison for the first time ."
2009-07-21,"The grandson of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , father of Iran 's Islamic revolution , is reported to have left the country to avoid attending Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's presidential inauguration .
Hassan Khomeini , a supporter of the defeated reformist candidate , Mir Hossein Mousavi , has travelled to an unnamed "" neighbouring country "" to escape official pressure to be present at next month 's swearing - in ceremony , according to the pro - reformist news website , Salaamnews .
His absence would be a blow to the authorities ' hopes of using the hallowed Khomeini family name to confer legitimacy on the event in the face of allegations that Ahmadinejad owes his re - election to fraud .
Hassan — a member of the pro - reformist Association of Combatant Clerics — is the most well - known and politically active of Khomeini 's surviving descendants .
He has previously been attacked by hardliners for his moderate views and for an allegedly opulent lifestyle .
Last year , a pro - Ahmadinejad website accused him of indulging in steam baths and driving a BMW after he publicly urged military groups to stay out of politics .
His father , Ahmad Khomeini , was one of the late ayatollah 's closest aides but died in mysterious circumstances in 1995 .
Rumours circulated that he was poisoned after falling foul of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and the then president , Hashemi Rafsanjani , although the official cause of death was a heart attack .
Other members of the Khomeini clan have also fallen from official favour in recent years .
Another grandson , Ali Eshraghi , also a reformist , was barred from the candidates ' list for last year 's parliamentary elections by the guardian council , although he was later re - instated .
Hossein Khomeini , Hassan 's cousin , is a political outcast after repeatedly expressing pro - American views and calling for the regime 's overthrow ."
2009-07-22,"Iran 's hardline president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is under new pressure from conservatives after being ordered to reverse his controversial decision to appoint a senior deputy .
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader , has reportedly told him to sack Esfandiar Rahim - Mashai , who made waves last year when he made apparently favourable remarks about Israel – normally the focus of hatred and derision by Ahmadinejad and the Tehran regime in general .
To complicate matters , Mashai 's daughter is married to Ahmadinejad 's son , so family and politics are closely intertwined .
Mashai 's appointment as first vice - president – one of the first made by Ahmadinejad in advance of his second presidential term – was announced last Friday .
Complaints began almost immediately .
The job is a senior one because although Iran has 12 vice - presidents , only the first vice - president can chair cabinet meetings in the absence of the president .
The row underlines the fact that Khamenei calls the shots on all significant issues and that despite his endorsement of Ahmadinejad 's disputed victory over opposition candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi , he still insists on approving key appointments .
Analysts say the pressure to remove Mashai highlights Ahmadinejad 's dependence on individuals and groups who took part in the crackdown against his opponents after the election . ""
The view of the exalted leader [ Khamenei ] on removing Mashai from the post of vice president has been notified to Ahmadinejad in writing , "" the semi - official Fars news agency reported .
Another semi - official news agency , ISNA , quoted the deputy speaker of parliament , Mohammad Hasan Aboutorabi - Fard – a Khamenei loyalist – as saying that Mashai 's dismissal was a decision by the regime . ""
Removing Mashai … is a strategic decision of the system .
Dismissal or resignation of Mashai needs to be announced by the president without any delay . ""
Fars reported that Ahmadinejad might make as many as 19 changes to the cabinet , including the posts of foreign minister , finance minister and intelligence minister .
He has already appointed a new head of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organisation – responsible for the country 's controversial nuclear programme – after the previous incumbent , a friend of Mousavi , resigned suddenly .
But Ahmadinejad 's close adviser Mojtaba Samareh - Hashemi said there would be no re - examination of the Mashai appointment .
Samareh - Hashemi , an extreme hardliner , has been mooted as a possible foreign minister , say Iranian analysts .
Mashai himself , previously head of a state - run cultural and tourism organization , has defended himself against the charge of being friendly towards Israel . ""
What I said has nothing to do with the Israeli regime , "" he told the Irna news agency .
"" In fact , it was psychological war against the Israeli regime .
What I said was that this regime was in a mess and that it no longer enjoyed international support .
I did not say that we suddenly had become cousins and friends . """
2009-07-28,"Iran today responded to growing criticism over political detainees by freeing 140 inmates incarcerated in its most notorious jail following the recent post - election upheavals .
The prisoners were released from Tehran 's Evin prison after MPs inspected the facility , where hundreds of opposition politicians , activists and protesters have been held following protests over President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's bitterly disputed re - election .
The move followed the closure of another detention centre where human rights groups say torture led to several deaths .
Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , ordered the closure of Kahrizak prison on Tehran 's southern outskirts because it "" lacked the standards "" to maintain detainees ' rights , officials said .
The release of the Evin prisoners came a day after the judiciary chief , Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi , urged officials to free inmates not suspected of serious offences .
Some 150 political prisoners remain inside , according to official figures , including prominent supporters of the reformist candidate , Mir Hossein Mousavi , who claims last month 's presidential election was stolen from him .
Many prisoners are said to be under severe pressure to sign confessions admitting involvement in a foreign - backed plot to topple the regime .
This week , the Guardian reported how Evin inmates recently released claimed they had been beaten , abused and held in overcrowded conditions .
Ramin Ghahremani is said to have died from a blood clot after being suspended upside down from the jail ceiling , where he was taken after surrendering himself to the police .
Concern over the detainees triggered a fresh crisis after the death last week of Mohsen Rouholamini ‑ the son of a prominent scientist and regime insider ‑ reportedly from meningitis .
Rouholamini 's family says he developed an infection after injuries sustained under torture were untreated .
Another prisoner , Mohammad Kamrani , 18 , died in hospital of meningitis after being taken from Evin .
However , it has emerged that both had been previously been held in Kahrizak , where they were among detainees crammed into an underground makeshift cell after arrest during a demonstration on 9 July .
Norooz , the official website of the main reformist party , the Islamic Participation Front , said prisoners had been doused with water before being beaten with hoses and cables , though the reports could not be independently confirmed .
On Monday , Mousavi denounced the crackdown on opposition supporters as a "" disaster "" .
In a speech to a group of teachers , he said : "" People will not forgive these acts .
How is it possible that someone goes into a prison , then his body comes out ? ""
He demanded a judiciary investigation into Rouhalamini 's death : "" They will find out what happened .
This is not what we expect from the Islamic Republic , "" he said ."
2009-07-29,"A month ago today , the Guardian began an attempt to record the names and faces of those killed or imprisoned in Iran since the 12 June election – and we asked you to help , locating the blogs , Facebook profiles and news stories connected with those in the protests against what was claimed as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's victory .
Iran 's official figures for the six weeks since the election include 2,500 arrests in Tehran alone , with as many as 150 still in jail and 30 dead .
The true figures are believed to be much higher – the death toll could be in the hundreds .
Our figures come from human rights groups and campaigners inside and outside Iran , news reports and our users .
They are : 80 dead , around 750 still detained , just under 100 released and 10 missing or not heard of since the mid - June protests .
Iran yesterday announced the release of 140 people from Evin prison , the Tehran jail where many of the protesters and opposition figures were held .
We do not know at present who these people were ; if you do please use this form to tell us .
The detained include students , members of the main opposition parties , former members of ex - president Mohammad Khatami 's reformist administration , campaigners for Ahmadinejad 's main opponent , Mir Hossein Mousavi , journalists and bloggers .
Over the last few weeks , human rights lawyers have been detained too – Mohammad Ali Dadkhah , a founder member of Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi 's Human Rights Defenders Centre , was arrested with several colleagues while Shadi Sadr , a lawyer and women 's rights activist , was seized on the street and bundled in to a car just under two weeks ago .
Campaigners are also pressing for the release of Kian Tajbakhsh , an American - Iranian scholar said to be under pressure to confess involvement in an alleged western plot to orchestrate the protests .
There is concern about the conditions in which the detainees are being held .
On Monday , we reported the deaths of Mohsen Rouholamini , 25 , and Amir Javadifar , 24 , from meningitis after their injuries went untreated .
Ramin Ghahremani , 30 , who died in hospital days after his release , told his mother he had been hung upside down from the ceiling .
Isa Saharkhiz , a prominent reformist journalist and commentator , reportedly suffered broken ribs after being tortured under interrogation .
Saeed Hajarian , disabled since an assassination attempt in 2000 and in need of daily medical care , was reported by his wife to be undergoing interrogations in 40-degree heat and to be "" completely weak and was unable to speak easily "" .
He may be one of those set to be released .
The father of one of the detained , Mohammadreza Jalaeipour , 27 , an Oxford PhD student and Mousavi 's social media strategist ( in this interview with the Wall Street Journal , he says he developed many ideas while obsessively following the Obama campaign ) , compared the jails to Abu Ghraib .
One , however , has been closed : Kahrizak , on the southern edge of Tehran , which Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , said "" lacked the standards "" to hold prisoners .
It is thought that many of those arrested on the 9 July protests were held there .
Then there are the dead – those who died in jail and those killed in protests , such as Neda Agha Soltan .
Our list also includes Mohammed Asghari , who had responsibility for the security of the IT network in Iran 's interior ministry and was killed in a suspicious car accident in Tehran .
He reportedly leaked evidence that the elections were rigged .
Tomorrow is the 40th day since the shooting of Neda Agha Soltan , an important marker in the Shia Islam practised in Iran .
Mousavi and other opposition leaders have asked permission to hold a public mourning ceremony .

2009-08-01,"The first trials of opposition political activists and protesters arrested after June 's disputed Iranian presidential election began today .
Up to 100 defendants were reported by Iranian media to be appearing before a court in the capital , Tehran , accused of violence following the 12 June vote .
The election sparked days of protests as thousands of Iranians took to the streets to denounce the official results , which declared victory for the incumbent president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The official IRNA news agency said the defendants were charged with rioting , attacking military and government buildings , having links with armed opposition groups and conspiring against the ruling system .
Under the country 's Islamic law , acting against national security – a common charge against dissidents – could be punishable by a long sentence or even the death penalty .
Several prominent reformist opposition activists – including the former vice president Mohammat Ali Abtahi , Abdollah Ramezanzadeh , a former government spokesman , and Behzad Nabavi , an ex - vice Speaker of parliament – are among the defendants .
The Associated Press said the former deputy foreign minister Mohsen Aminzadeh and Mohsen Mirdamadi , the leader of Iran 's biggest reformist party , the Islamic Iran Participation Front , were also facing trial .
Photographs from the courtroom showed a Abtahi and Mirdamadi , wearing prison uniform , sitting in the front row .
Many other defendants were handcuffed but were not wearing prison clothes .
Prosecutors read out an indictment outlining what they alleged was a year - long plot by leading pro - reform political parties to carry out a "" velvet revolution "" – a popular , non - violent uprising to overthrow the Islamic Republic .
The phrase comes from the peaceful 1989 velvet revolution which overthrew decades of communism in Czechoslovakia .
The prosecutor said three of the biggest opposition parties had taken money from foreign non - governmental organisations and sought to use the election controversy as an opportunity to carry out their plot , according to a transcript reported by IRNA .
He claimed Israeli and western officials had spoken in recent years of fomenting revolution in Iran . ""
Based on the evidence obtained and well - founded confessions of the defendants , these events had been planned in advance and stages of the velvet revolution were carried out in accordance with a time schedule , "" the indictment said .
IRNA did not give information about how many defendants were in court , but the semi - official Fars news agency said more than 100 were present .
State media did not provide further details about the trial , and there was no information on when it would end and when a verdict could be expected .
The reformist mowjcamp website denounced the trial , saying defendants had no access to lawyers and there was no jury . ""
Do those who organised this show trial think that the nation will remain silent to slaughter the nation 's best ? ""
it asked .
Iran 's opposition maintains Ahmadinejad stole the vote from the opposition leader , Mir Hossein Mousavi , but demonstrations have been ruthlessly suppressed , leaving hundreds in prison .
Yesterday , Ahmadinejad said the Iranian supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , was like a father to him .
The president accused his hardline rivals of trying to drive a wedge between him and the man who sits at the top of Iran 's clerical leadership and has final say in all state matters .
On Monday , Khamenei will lead a ceremony formally approving Ahmadinejad 's second term .
He will be sworn in before parliament two days later ."
2009-08-02,"Iran 's opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi and the former reformist president Mohammad Khatami have signalled continuing defiance by denouncing "" show trials "" of politicians and activists charged with fomenting unrest after the disputed election .
Both men today lambasted the Tehran regime for using forced confessions to accuse senior opposition figures of "" acting against national security "" and "" conspiring with foreign powers to stage a velvet revolution "" .
Mousavi , a former prime minister who is widely believed to have beaten the incumbent hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the presidency in the 12 June contest , claimed that the authorities had been using torture . ""
Soon we will see the trials of those who committed these crimes , the torturers and interrogators , "" Mousavi pledged on his Ghalamnews website .
On Saturday Iranian state media broadcast pictures of some 100 defendants , including some of the country 's most prominent reformists , facing trial in a closed session covered only by the semi - official Fars News agency .
Mohammad - Ali Abtahi , a former vice - president , reportedly testified that the vote was "" clean "" and that allegations of fraud in the election were "" a lie "" , fuelling accusations that he had spoken under duress . ""
The trial was a show and the confessions are invalid , "" Khatami 's website stated .
"" What was called a trial was a violation of the constitution .
Such show trials will directly harm the system and further damage public trust .
"" These strongly worded statements by the regime 's two most prominent critics will ensure Iran 's political turmoil continues despite attempts to move to business as usual during a second term for Ahmadinejad , who is due to be sworn in before parliament on Wednesday .
Abtahi said , according to his alleged confession , that Mousavi , Khatami and the powerful cleric Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani had all taken an "" oath "" as they prepared to stage a "" velvet revolution "" – a phrase originating in eastern Europe but used by the Islamic regime as shorthand for foreign - orchestrated subversion .
The pro - Ahmadinejad paper Kayhan dubbed those three and the reformist presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi "" the leaders of the civil war "" and demanded they too should be prosecuted .
Rafsanjani , who is often criticised for sitting on the fence , quickly denied he had taken any oath and insisted he had not backed any candidate for president .
But the cleric – who heads both the expediency council and the assembly of experts – also questioned the reliability of the alleged confessions , Press TV reported .
Friends and relatives of the defendants said they were shocked by pictures broadcast from the courtroom .
Lawyer Mohammad Reza Tabesh quoted Abtahi 's wife as saying that he had lost 40 lb after 43 days in custody .
Other high - profile figures in court included former deputy foreign minister Mohsen Aminzadeh , former government spokesman Abdollah Ramezanzadeh , former MP Mohsen Mirdamadi , former industry minister Behzad Nabavi and the commentator Mohammad Atrianfar .
They face a maximum jail term of five years if convicted , unless they are charged with being a "" mohareb "" or enemy of God , which can carry the death penalty ."
2009-08-03,"Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , formally endorsed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's second term as president today , seven weeks after bitterly disputed elections prompted mass protests and deep divisions within the country 's elite .
The event , footage of which was broadcast by state - owned al - Alam television , was boycotted by the former presidents Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami , as well as the defeated candidates , Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mahdi Karroubi .
The somewhat awkward ceremony ended with Ahmadinejad giving the cleric a kiss on the shoulder .
At the equivalent event four years ago , Ahmadinejad kissed Khamenei 's hand and was embraced by the cleric .
But today , when he approached Khamenei in an apparent attempt to repeat the gesture , Khamenei initially held out an arm to apparently keep him at more of a distance .
Khamenei nontheless used the ceremony to describe the election as a "" golden page "" in Iran 's political history , saying it was a "" vote for the fight against arrogance and brave resistance to the international domination - seekers "" – a clear reference to foreign criticism .
Ahmadinejad , who according to official results took 63 % of the votes cast in the 12 June poll , will be sworn in by the country 's mainly conservative parliament on Wednesday , and will have a fortnight to submit his cabinet list to the legislature .
The opposition says Ahmadinejad and his supporters stole the election from Mousavi by fraud .
The official results said Mousavi had won 34 % of the 40 m votes cast .
Ahmadinejad 's re - election saw hundreds of thousands of Iranians take to the streets in protest .
At least 30 people died and hundreds of demonstrators were imprisoned .
Opposition groups say the number of dead is much higher .
More than 100 opposition members and activists accused of being involved in post - election violence appeared in court in Tehran at the weekend for the start of what opponents of the government claim is a mass show trial .
Both Mousavi and Khatami , the reformist former president , have denounced the hearings .
According to Iranian media reports , the charges include rioting , attacking military and government buildings and conspiring against the ruling system .
Many defendants had spent weeks in jail without access to lawyers , Mousavi said yesterday .
The unrest , Iran 's worst since the 1979 Islamic revolution , continued late last week as police fired teargas and wielded batons to disperse thousands of anti - government protesters attending a graveside memorial for victims of the crackdown .
Police stopped Mousavi and hundreds of his supporters as they tried to reach the grave of Neda Soltan , the young woman who became a symbol of the protest movement after her death was captured on video .
Ahmadinejad , 52 , faces divisions within his own political support base , and the disputed election has exposed rifts within the clergy , with several senior clerics siding with the opposition ."
2009-08-03,"Iranian hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is on course for a new four - year presidential term after the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , today ignored bitter divisions at home and deep dismay abroad to publicly endorse him as a "" brave , hard - working and wise man "" .
Ahmadinejad will be formally sworn in outside the Iranian parliament in Tehran on Wednesday , but the depth of domestic opposition to him was plain when the country 's leading reformists and moderates boycotted the official ceremony with Khamenei .
Two former presidents , Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami , conspicuously failed to attend , underlining their disapproval of the controversial populist who claimed victory in June 's disputed election .
Yesterday Khatami angrily condemned the regime 's "" show trials "" of leading supporters of the defeated presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi .
Both men suggested that some of the accused had been tortured into making false confessions .
Security forces were deployed today to forestall protests by Mousavi supporters in central Tehran – a now familiar scene in the seven weeks since the poll .
Thousands gathered between Vali - e - Asr and Vanak Squares , which connect central and northern Tehran , although the semi - official Pars news agency said only 100 people took part in the "" illegal demonstrations "" .
Riot police in black uniforms used tear gas to disperse people shouting "" death to the dictator "" and "" coup government , resign , resign "" .
Some threw stones .
"" I ca n't just stay at home and watch the TV showing the supreme leader endorsing a president who has come to power by a coup , "" a young woman said .
Many are planning to demonstrate again tomorrow .
Immediately after the election it had been hoped that Khamenei would order a recount or annul the poll .
But he rejected all criticism and today described the election as a "" golden page "" in Iran 's history , a "" vote for the fight against arrogance and brave resistance to the international domination - seekers "" – a reference to the US , Britain and others .
"" Iranian people have voted in favour of a fight against arrogance , to confront destitution and spread justice , "" the state - owned Alalam television quoted him as saying .
The regime has been unable to mask the unprecedented polarisation of the political scene : for the first time in 20 years the ceremony was not shown live on Iranian domestic television in an apparent effort to avoid drawing attention to the boycott by senior figures .
In a pointed move , the number two at the British embassy in Tehran , Patrick Davies , was sent to attend yesterday 's ceremony instead of the ambassador , Simon Gass .
The foreign office said it had done so to show there was no "" business as usual "" with the regime .
Nine Iranians employed by the British embassy were arrested last month and accused of playing a role in protests against the disputed election result .
All were released , although one of them , a 44-year - old who acts as the embassy 's chief political analyst , is to stand trial for "" acting against national security "" .
Sealed without a kiss Ayatollah Ali Khamenei may have now warmly endorsed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as Iran 's new president , but there was a distinct chilliness in the body language on display on the podium at today 's [ MON ] ceremony in Tehran .
Ahmadinejad , wearing a business suit rather than his trademark windcheater , made to embrace the supreme leader of the Islamic revolution – but was apparently rebuffed as the cleric held out his arm to keep a little distance .
The result was that the president ending up kissing Khamenei on his shoulder .
What a difference four years make .
At the equivalent event in 2005 Ahmadinejad kissed Khamenei 's hand and was rewarded with a warm embrace and an affectionate kiss on each cheek .
Maybe Khamenei 's ambitious son Mojtaba , seen watching intently from the sidelines , would have been jealous ."
2009-08-03,"Update : Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , was supposed to be endorsing Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for his second term as the president of Iran , but his awkward body language at today 's ceremony has again raised questions about possible splits in the regime .
Ahmadinejad was permitted only a peck on the shoulder of Khamenei , and the supreme leader did not embrace the president as he did four years ago .
CNN contrasts the footage of the two ceremonies .
It suggests that today 's fumbled shoulder kiss illustrates a rift between Khamenei and Ahmadinejad .
The body language at the presidential inauguration ceremony on Wednesday will now be even more closely scrutinised .
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Canadian - based Iranian cartoonist Nikahang Kosar sums up the attitude of Iran 's opposition movement to the prospect of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad being sworn in as president .
His depiction of the disputed president as a puppet of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei shows that the whole regime is being held up to contempt and ridicule .
The absence of key senior figures from the ceremony has also been noted .
Pictures from the ceremony show there was no sign of the former presidents Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami , or of the defeated presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi .
It is perhaps another sign that the divisions in the regime are being more clearly drawn .
The pro - Ahmadinejad newspaper Kayhan described Rafsanjani , Khatami , Mousavi and another presidential candidate , Mehdi Karoubi , as "" the leaders of the civil war "" .
Meanwhile , the decision to televise "" confessions "" from leading figures charged with conspiring against the regime appears to have backfired .
A post on the Iran Revolution blog highlights the hamfisted editing on state TV of former vice - president Mohammad Ali Abtahi 's apparent confession .
It also points to a prophetic spoof confession made three weeks ago , which imagined what Abtahi might be asked to confess .
Global Voices carries pictures of Abtahi before and after his arrest , which suggest he has lost weight during his 40 days in prison .
Even the defeated conservative candidate Mohsen Rezai has questioned the trials , calling instead for the security forces to be tried .
State - funded Press TV today insisted the confessions were genuine ."
2009-08-04,"When your inauguration party is being snubbed by all and sundry , it does n't do to be too fussy about the guest list .
So when a host of senior clerics and political luminaries announced they were boycotting Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's endorsement ceremony to protest against his disputed re - election , his aides decided that past indiscretions would be no barrier to filling the empty seats .
Among those present at yesterday 's event was Dariush Farziayi , aka Amoo Pourang ( Uncle Pourang ) , presenter of a popular children 's TV phone - in programme recently pulled from the schedules after a young caller revealed live on air that his toy monkey was named Ahmadinejad .
Farziayi was among a group of celebrities invited to make up the numbers after leading officials and opposition figures , including former presidents Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami , as well as relatives of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , declined to attend .
At least one senior adviser to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – who endorsed Ahmadinejad for a second term – and Mir Hossein Mousavi , the leading reformist candidate who claims the June election was stolen from him , were also absent .
In their place was a non - political list of figures from the sporting and entertainment world , including Iran 's national football team coach , Afshin Ghotbi , an Olympic gold medal - wining weightlifter nicknamed the "" Iranian Hercules "" , Hossein Rezazadeh and several actors .
A state TV presenter , Iman Merati , was forced to shut his blog after receiving more than 2,000 abusive messages –
many of them obscene – from respondents furious over an interview last weekend with two jailed opposition figures , Mohammad Ali Abtahi and Mohammad Atrianfar , in which they "" confessed "" to having falsely called Ahmadinejad 's re - election fraudulent .
The two had earlier read a confession at a show trial involving more than 100 detained reformists ."
2009-08-04,"When Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made his first visit to the US as president of Iran , I attended a ceremony at the Manhattan Hilton where he was speaking .
Having gone there out of sheer curiosity , I sat listening , with some 450 others .
After reciting a few verses from the Qur'an , Ahmadinejad spoke of the greatness of the Iranian nation and its equally great achievements under the Islamic republic .
Then Ali Larijani , Iran 's former head of the nuclear programme , stepped on the podium asking the "" wonderful Iranians abroad "" to support the nuclear energy programme just as they had supported Iran 's struggle for oil nationalisation half a century ago .
At this point , I could no longer contain myself .
My father was prime minister Mohammed Mosaddeq 's personal attorney , and I got up and shouted : "" But there is not a street or an alley in all of Iran in the name of the man who nationalised the oil .
You are lying .
"" I ran towards the table where the president of Iran and his entourage were sitting .
Again , without any prior plans , I cried out to him : "" You have ruined my country . ""
He did n't bat an eye and calmly and cleverly answered : "" Let 's go back and build our country together .
"" I had just enough composure to continue with a riposte : "" Your regime jails whoever comes and tries to help their country . ""
We engaged in a one - to - one conversation for nearly 25 minutes .
I pointed out the human rights abuses , the gap between the rich and the poor , the appointment of two shady characters in his cabinet and so on , before two American security guards politely took me away .
After the encounter , I told people that this man should not be underestimated .
I thought he was street smart , a wise guy who knew how to talk and relate to his audience .
I was not wrong .
Later on , I learned that the ultra - conservative daily , Kayhan , had mentioned that "" a hijabless woman , in improper clothing , had insulted the president of Iran "" .
All of which was of course a lie .
The hijab was mandatory , my outfit was black ( in fact I had bought it at the Friday bazaar in Tehran ) and I only told the truth .
But even Ahmadinejad did not know that after four years of popular rhetoric , shouting foul about imperialist and Zionist threats , a vicious attack on Iran 's civil society and destructive economic plans , Iranians would vote him out of office .
He may have been too delusional to realise that people would unmask him and see through the demagoguery .
But he was clever enough to prepare himself for discomfiture before the elections .
With an electoral fraud machine , and the supreme leader 's unconditional support , he unleashed his basiji friends with clubs , bayonets and even bullets to attack .
Yet he was not prepared for the outcry and the anger that followed in the form of massive demonstrations .
The Islamic republic , 30 years after its inception , has lost its legitimacy by responding to this peaceful outpouring of popular anti - regime sentiment with lethal violence and numerous arrests .
Today , Ahmadinejad can no longer blame the western powers for the violence perpetrated against Iranians .
Not after Mohsen Rouholamini , the son of an adviser to his rival , Mohsen Rezai , died in the notorious Evin prison .
Today , neither Israel nor the Great Satan but the homegrown basijis are torturing and murdering this nation 's sons and daughters .
The movement continues and all indications are that people are more determined than ever .
There is too much at stake .
Freedom has been trampled upon .
Every martyr 's death is marked by more vigils and protests .
The camaraderie and solidarity among Iranians are unprecedented , both in Iran and abroad .
Too many innocent lives have been lost ; dozens of civil rights activists , lawyers and journalists are in jail .
Countless mothers and fathers are faced with the broken bodies of their youngsters .
It is now a matter of life and death for Iranian society .
The strangulation of Iran which began some 30 years ago is not over but the regime has suffered major blows .
Worst of all , Ali Khamenei , the divinely ordained leader , has turned his back on the people he is held to protect in the name of God .
The highest clerics of the land are now questioning the lodestone of the regime , the notion of Velayat Faghih , the guardianship of the jurist , introduced by Ayatollah Khomeini .
Its days are clearly numbered ."

Iran 's deep domestic divisions were dramatically displayed as riot police confronted hundreds of demonstrators – many shouting "" death to the dictator "" – outside the parliament in Tehran where he was sworn in for four more years .
Reformists , including defeated presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi , ex - president Mohammad Khatami and many MPs , boycotted the ceremony .
Ahmadinejad said he did not care that the US , Britain , France and Germany had said they would not be congratulating him . ""
No one in Iran is waiting for your messages , "" he said to cheers . ""
The Iranian nation neither values your scowls and threats , nor your smiles and greetings . ""
Otherwise , he spoke in a fairly low key . ""
Internationally , we seek peace and security , "" the president said .
"" But because we want this for all of humanity , we oppose injustice , aggression and the high - handedness of some countries . ""
But there was an early example of the difficulties of dealing with the hardliner when the White House amended its earlier description of Ahmadinejad as "" Iran 's elected leader "" .
Spokesman Robert Gibbs said : "" He 's been inaugurated .
That 's a fact .
Whether any election was fair , obviously the Iranian people still have questions about that , and we 'll let them decide . ""
Britain 's ambassador to Iran , Simon Gass , attended the ceremony , signalling a pragmatic approach to a country whose nuclear ambitions alone make it the sharp focus of international concern . ""
While we need to engage with Iran 's government , today 's ceremony does not change our position on Iran 's elections , "" the Foreign Office said .
"" It is Iranians who decide who runs Iran , not us . ""
Germany sent a junior official to the ceremony .
State media reported more than 5,000 security personnel around parliament .
Police used batons and pepper spray to attack protesters , and witnesses said at least 10 people were detained .
Foreign media have been banned from going out to cover any opposition activities .
The former mayor of Tehran has two weeks to form a new government in the face of resentment by many conservatives .
He has the backing of Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , but they have clashed over key appointments .
Ahmadinejad promised in his speech to "" protect the official faith , the system of the Islamic revolution and the constitution . ""
Before his speech , the conservative head of Iran 's judiciary , Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi , urged him "" to not use force … on minor issues "" .
Ahmadinejad 's economic team will be crucial , given Iran 's double - digit inflation , unemployment and opposition to the populist policies he pursued in his first term .
"" It will be problematic on nearly all fronts for Ahmadinejad , "" predicted the London - based analyst , Baqer Moin .
Ahmadinejad 's approach to the nuclear issue will also be critical – though it is Khamenei who calls the shots .
Barack Obama has given Tehran until September to agree to start talks on its uranium enrichment programme , which the west and Israel believe is intended to produce nuclear weapons .
Experts say that despite his often strong language , Ahmadinejad wants to do a deal with Washington . ""
Alongside the aggressive rhetoric that wish is still there , "" said Arshin Adib - Moghaddam of London University 's School of Oriental and African Studies .
"" Iran can still play a role in the context of Iraq and Afghanistan . ""
Failure to make progress on the nuclear issue will deter western investors and could trigger harsher sanctions .
Analysts expect street protests to continue but say they will be combined with an insistence that opposition is "" loyal , "" avoiding the charge of challenging the regime itself .
Ahmadinejad 's new term is overshadowed by a sense that the very legitimacy of the Islamic republic has been damaged , even if the regime remains in control .
"" The office of the leader is no longer considered independent , "" said Adib - Moghaddam .
"" Khamenei has made a serious political mistake by aligning himself so closely with Ahmadinejad . "" The religious establishment is divided too .
Hardliners would like to see a harsher crackdown , though Khamenei seems to be resisting them .
A key question is whether there will be more spectacles like last weekend 's "" show trial "" of opposition leaders "" confessing "" to their misdeeds .
Ahmadinejad has a habit of scorning his critics .
But some speculate that he may be removed by Khamenei or impeached by parliament before completing a second term . ""
The pragmatic conservatives will try to retake the initiative and prepare for the next parliamentary elections , "" said Moin . ""
Ahmadinejad will survive unless his volatility and single - mindedness gives them a chance to dismiss him . """
2009-08-05,"After Ahmadinejad 's inauguration , what happens next in Iran ?
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is the president of a polarised country that has been profoundly shaken by the turbulent events since June 's disputed election – the worst crisis since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
He has two difficult weeks ahead to form a new government in the face of strong opposition from conservatives in the majlis ( parliament ) , who were angered by the unequivocal support he got from the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
The majlis speaker , Ali Larijani , has been especially critical .
Ahmadinejad , who is backed by senior Revolutionary Guard commanders , has also run into difficulty with Khamenei over key appointments .
Economic portfolios will be divisive , and his choice of foreign minister will send an important signal about relations with the wider world .
"" It will be problematic on nearly all fronts for Ahmadinejad , "" predicted one analyst , Baqer Moin .
How will Ahmadinejad handle the economy ?
The election crisis has further weakened the economy after profligate spending squandered reserves built up by windfall oil revenues .
Inflation and unemployment are in double digits , and a recession is likely this year .
Economists say priorities should be job creation for young people and more privatisation .
Ahmadinejad speaks of equality and opportunity for all citizens and the fair distribution of wealth , but his populist approach is opposed by bazaaris – wealthy figures such as the former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , who has links to the business community .
Failure to make progress on the nuclear issue will deter western investors and could trigger harsher international sanctions , including restrictions on petrol imports .
What about the nuclear impasse ?
Time is short .
Barack Obama has given Tehran a deadline of September to agree to talks about its uranium enrichment programme , which the west believes is intended to produce nuclear weapons .
Israel is signalling that it has not ruled out an attack if diplomacy fails .
Some experts argue that Ahmadinejad does want to do a deal with Washington . ""
Alongside the aggressive rhetoric that wish is still there , "" said Arshin Adib - Moghaddam of London University 's School of Oriental and African Studies .
"" Iran can still play a role in the context of Iraq and Afghanistan . ""
But will it be harder for the US and others to deal with a man who is considered a tyrant at home ?
Realpolitik will decide .
"" If Ahmadinejad manages a breakthrough with the Americans , it will help the economy and national security , "" said another Iran watcher .
""
After all , Ahmadinejad is no worse than the king of Saudi Arabia , "" added Moin . ""
The Americans accept the elected president of Iran whether he is legitimate or not . ""
The presence of Britain 's ambassador at the inauguration ceremony – despite angry accusations of British involvement in the unrest and the arrest of embassy employees – makes exactly that point .
What next for the opposition ?
The defeated presidential candidates Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karoubi , backed by the reformist former president Mohammad Khatami , say the 12 June vote was rigged .
Their boycott of the inauguration was intended to underline their belief that Ahmadinejad has no legitimacy .
Sporadic street protests and other acts of civil disobedience are likely to continue , but they will be combined with an insistence that opposition is "" loyal "" and within the framework of the constitution , avoiding the charge of challenging the regime itself .
Mousavi has vowed to set up a new political front to "" preserve people 's votes "" .
Karoubi has called for what would be an unprecedented popular referendum on the legitimacy of the government .
Expect behind - the - scenes activity by the highly influential Rafsanjani , especially with the disgruntled clerics in Qom .
How stable is the regime ?
Iran 's crisis has exposed sharp internal divisionsl , and there is a widespread sense that the very legitimacy of the Islamic republic has been damaged . ""
The office of the leader is no longer considered independent , "" said Adib - Moghaddam . ""
Khamenei has made a serious political mistake by aligning himself so closely with Ahmadinejad .
"" The religious establishment is divided , with many senior Shia clerics refraining from congratulating Ahmadinejad .
But the demonstrations are not a threat to the security of the regime .
Hardliners would like to see a harsher crackdown , though Khamenei seems to be resisting them .
A key question is whether there will be more spectacles like last weekend 's "" show trial "" of opposition leaders "" confessing "" to their misdeeds .
Ahmadinejad , who was relatively low key as he took the oath , has a habit of scorning his critics .
But some speculate that he may be removed by Khamenei or impeached by parliament before completing his second term . ""
The pragmatic conservatives will try to retake the initiative and prepare for the next parliamentary elections , "" said Moin . ""
Ahmadinejad will survive unless his volatility and single - mindedness gives them a chance to dismiss him . """
2009-08-05,"Britain 's decision to send its ambassador to the inauguration ceremony of the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has been criticised by an opposition activist whose husband was detained in the post - election crackdown .
The Foreign Office confirmed that the deputy head of mission , Patrick Davies , went to Monday 's blessing of Ahmadinejad by Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and that the ambassador , Simon Gass , attended today 's ceremony despite strained relations between the countries .
Fatemeh Shams , 26 , a student at Oxford University whose husband , Mohammadreza Jalaeipour , was detained as the pair tried to leave the country in June , said perceived waning support from abroad was the "" main concern "" for reformists in Iran . ""
Any kind of support given to this coup state is not acceptable , "" she said .
"" The majority of Iranian people would criticise Britain if they realised its representative was there . ""
She said most Iranian reformists had stayed away from the ceremony and three who attended were being harshly criticised on opposition websites .
Jalaeipour , 27 , also an Oxford student , is still being held .
Shams said her parents visited him in jail three days ago .
In the aftermath of the disputed election , Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , blamed western powers for interfering in Iranian politics , singling out the UK as the "" most treacherous "" .
In response , Iran 's ambassador to London was summoned to the Foreign Office and told that the supreme leader 's remarks were unacceptable .
A Foreign Office spokesman said : "" It is not business as usual , which is why we have not sent a message of congratulations . ""
He said the decision not to send the traditional message followed informal EU co - ordination between embassies in Tehran , although it was ultimately a matter for individual member states .
He defended the decision to send a representative to the inauguration ceremony , saying it was necessary to continue engagement with Iran on British concerns .
"" We have several issues we need to address with the government , including its nuclear programme and human rights , and to do that we need to keep channels of communication open . ""
Ahmadinejad did not refer to the UK directly in his speech after taking the oath of office in parliament , but said : "" Some governments should feel responsible for the words and deeds , interferences , occupations ...
They need to be accountable for this . ""
He said Iran would "" resist violation of law and interference and abuse of national mechanisms and discrimination "" ."
2009-08-05,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's inauguration as Iranian president for a second term was marked by opposition walkouts , demonstrations and criticism from his own conservative camp today as pressure mounted on the disputed winner of Iran 's election .
Senior officials and clerics attended the ceremony at Iran 's parliament but it was boycotted by many opposition leaders and moderate politicians .
Those of the reform faction who did attend walked out when Ahmadinejad started speaking , according to the opposition website Parleman News .
Hundreds of opposition supporters gathered outside parliament and further protests were reported to be planned for 30 locations at 7 pm Iranian time ( 3.30pm GMT ) .
The opposition claims Ahmadinejad stole the vote in the 12 June presidential elections .
At least 30 demonstrators were killed in uprisings that followed .
Despite recent friction between Iran and Britain , the British ambassador , Simon Gass , was there to hear Ahmadinejad renew his attacks on western countries , which Iranian officials blame for stirring up unrest after the election . ""
Some governments should feel responsible for the words and deeds , interferences , occupations … they need to be accountable for this , "" the president said .
The Iranian people wanted "" constructive dialogue "" with the international community , he said , but added : "" We will resist violation of law and interference and abuse of national mechanisms and discrimination … We will not remain silent . ""
Britain 's Foreign Office defended the decision to send Gass to the ceremony .
A spokesman said it was important "" to keep channels of communication open "" to address issues of concern , including Iran 's nuclear programme and human rights .
He said it was "" not business as usual "" as the UK was not sending a letter of congratulations to Ahmadinejad .
Following informal EU co - ordination , Germany and France followed suit , as did the US .
In his speech after taking the oath of office , Ahmadinejad mocked the snub , saying : "" Well , no one in Iran is waiting for your messages . ""
Some in the audience responded with cheers .
Before Ahmadinejad 's speech , the conservative head of Iran 's judiciary , Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi , urged him "" to not use force … on minor issues "" .
Ahmadinejad remained dismissive of the allegations of vote - rigging as he urged Iranians to stand together . ""
Who has voted for whom is not the question … today we need a national will .
We need to join forces . ""
Hundreds of police were deployed around the parliament and a subway station nearby was closed to the public as opposition groups called protesters on to the streets .
Opposition websites urged supporters of Ahmadinejad 's main rival , Mir Hossein Mousavi , to protest against the swearing - in .
Reuters reported a witness seeing hundreds of Mousavi supporters walking around the parliament building despite a heavy presence of riot police and Basij militia .
The witness said there were no clashes but at least 10 people were arrested and mobile phones were cut off .
There were reports of teargas used against protesters .
Other witnesses said security troops dispersed hundreds of protesters chanting "" Death to the dictator "" in streets near the parliament building .
The detained were said to include protesters who wore black T - shirts in a sign of grief over Ahmadinejad 's inauguration .
Others were a young man in green trousers – the colour of Mousavi 's movement – a middle - aged woman carrying a royalist banner in support of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , who was toppled in the 1979 Islamic revolution , and another woman chanting pro - Mousavi slogans .
The official IRNA news agency said there had been no "" disturbance of the peace "" .
Inside parliament , Ahmadinejad said : "" I , as the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran , swear before the holy Qur'an and the Iranian nation and God to be the guardian of the official religion , the Islamic Republic and the constitution . ""
He pledged to protect the constitution and frontiers of Iran .
He said his main focus would be on "" progress and development "" , and that he knew the Iranian people were "" committed to the same principles "" .
On Monday , Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , ignored bitter divisions at home and deep dismay abroad to publicly endorse Ahmadinejad as a "" brave , hard - working and wise man "" ."
2009-08-06,"Another ceremony , another stage decorated with the Islamic republic 's flag , a long line of yellow daffodils and photos of martyrs of the revolution .
One chief of justice , Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi , one speaker of the parliament , Ali Larijani , and one man who claims to be the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , taking the oath of office to be "" at the service of the people "" .
Iranians have seen hundreds of these faked ceremonies , and yet , 30 years on from the revolution of 1979 , this was probably the one they least believed .
It might have been an easy ceremony to perform but , this time , it was very difficult to make it convincing .
Ahmadinejad 's position is increasingly challenging .
According to the constitution he has to present his cabinet to the parliament two weeks after being sworn in .
Yet only last week he caused a serious crisis just by mentioning his choice of vice - president , Esfandyar Rahim Mashaei .
The supreme leader disagreed and 205 members of parliament wrote a letter questioning his wisdom .
He then removed the man from that post only to put him back as his chief of staff – inviting yet another barrage of criticism .
In his first term , too , Ahmadinejad had to spend almost nine months trying to get approval for key ministers in his cabinet .
And by the end of his first term a total of 12 members of his cabinet had gone .
Apart from one who died of natural causes , the others were either sacked or had to resign .
Many were unknown faces and regarded as having little or no experience in politics .
Several had given false information about their education and background .
Four ministers had faked having a PhD , another had faked a scientific discovery and was consequently taken to court by the person who had the copyright , and another had claimed to be the member of an international scientific association in New York but that association denied such a membership .
Thus we can only expect a long wait before all ministers are approved by the parliament .
In the websites of the right and far right there are several lists of names proposed to Ahmadinejad for his cabinet .
The Supreme Leader is cautioning him on his choice of cabinet and the speaker of the parliament warned him yesterday to make sure he abides by the constitution when presenting his cabinet .
More than 40 members of the minority parties did not attend his swearing - in ceremony yesterday and the chances are that he will face a crisis of authority and legitimacy not just from the reformists but also from the politicians of right and centre in the parliament .
Away from the political scene Ahmadinejad has angered many by his abysmal performance in handling Iran 's complex economic problems .
His only policy line , "" fighting poverty and equality in distribution of wealth "" has failed .
The rate of inflation is 30 % , making it impossible for the poor to cope with rising prices ; the rate of poverty , according to official figures , is 18 % and rising .
Ahmadinejad 's style of fighting poverty – direct distribution of cash among the poor – may have brought him votes , but it has angered many Iranian economists who see it as throwing away extra revenue from oil .
They are calling instead for a comprehensive strategy to eradicate poverty .
Yet the economy may be the least of his worries .
The most important would be to know what to do with the opposition and their leadership .
The faces that were missing from both the confirmation and inauguration ceremonies – Rafsanjani , Khatami , Mousavi , Karoubi – or those detained and imprisoned –
Abtahi , Atrianfar , Hajarian , Tajzadeh and many more – have been the pillars of the Islamic republic and have customarily attended every ceremony .
Their unprecedented absence indicates the end of their tolerance for faked shows .
What will Ahmadinejad do with them ?
The show trials and fabricated website reports have already accused them of the worst crime : that of plotting in conjunction with the west for a "" colour revolution "" .
Can the establishment afford yet another crisis by openly punishing , imprisoning or killing these people ?
It has done so several times before but not en masse and not in those high ranks .
Such action may polarise the society even further and potentially lead to armed confrontation .
With all those challenges it is not surprising that Ahmadinejad considers relations with the west as the least of his worries .
He says he does not care if "" they do not congratulate him , weep or smile "" .
Now he has left the west even more confused than before and may face sanctions if he does not meet the September deadline as set by Obama to "" engage "" with the US . ""
He has been inaugurated , "" said the White House spokesman , Robert Gibbs .
"" Whether any election was fair , obviously the Iranian people still have questions about that and we will let them decide that . ""
And those questions about the legitimacy of this presidency will be Ahmadinejad 's most serious challenge .
Many Iranians who have been involved in or indeed been watching nervously the events of the past seven weeks have serious doubts about his authority and his claim to "" serving the people "" .
The horrendous experience of young Iranians being attacked , beaten , tortured and killed simply for attending peaceful demonstrations has destroyed the small ray of hope that the young had for being heard by their government .
Ahmadinejad may still have the cautious support of the leader and the military might of the Islamic establishment –
the Revolutionary Guards and Basij militia – but he has a huge challenge convincing the young and the educated in Iran that he is their president ."
2009-08-10,"The former Iranian president Hashemi Rafsanjani today backed away from further confrontation over the country 's disputed presidential election by cancelling a potentially explosive Friday prayer sermon over fears it would trigger a renewed crackdown .
In a surprise move , Rafsanjani said he would not lead this week 's sermon at Tehran university as scheduled , for fear of provoking renewed violence by security forces against supporters of Mir Hossein Mousavi , his reformist ally who says June 's election was stolen from him .
The decision came amid concerns of a repeat of events that surrounded Rafsanjani 's sermon last month , when government forces fired tear gas and arrested dozens of Mousavi followers after they turned up in their thousands to register discontent over Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's re - election .
A statement from Rafsanjani 's office said he would "" not hold the political praying ceremony in order to avoid probable clashes "" .
The announcement came in response to a flood of inquiries over whether the sermon would go ahead .
The decision is highly unusual for Rafsanjani , who is Tehran 's longest - serving Friday prayer leader and one of four clerics designated to lead the sermons .
It appeared to signal a political climbdown after he used his previous sermon to challenge the political authority of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , by criticising the suppression and detention of demonstrators after the election .
The impression was reinforced when it emerged Rafsanjani had failed to answer a letter from another reformist candidate , Mehdi Karroubi , alleging that male and female detainees had been raped .
"" Some of the detainees of the unrest claim that the detained girls have been sexually assaulted with such brutality that they have all sustained intense vaginal tearing , "" Karroubi 's letter said .
"" The young men in detention were also sexually assaulted in a manner that some are now suffering from depression and other physical and psychological problems and are incapable of even leaving their homes . ""
Karroubi had called for the experts ' assembly , a powerful clerical body headed by Rafsanjani , to investigate the allegations .
But , according to his son , he decided to publish the claims after Rafsanjani failed to respond within a 10-day deadline .
Rafsanjani has been identified by Ahmadinejad and his hardline supporters as the leading orchestrator of the post - election upheaval .
Rafsanjani refused to attend a ceremony last week at which Khamenei officially endorsed Ahmadinejad 's second term .
In a speech in Mashhad last month , Ahmadinejad appeared to implicitly threaten Rafsanjani when he said that the leading person behind the unrest "" should be seized by the collar and dragged to court "" ."
2009-08-16,"He may have failed to wrest the presidency from Mahmoud Ahmadinejad but Mir Hossein Mousavi at least has the satisfaction of knowing his wife has helped wring an unexpected political concession from his main rival .
Zahra Rahnavard 's appearance at her husband 's side throughout his campaign highlighted the issue of women 's rights in Iran and wooed many female voters to Mousavi 's side .
Never before in the Islamic republic 's 30-year history had a woman played such a high - profile political role , prompting some to compare Rahnavard – a sculptor and respected academic – with Michelle Obama .
Now her lasting impact has galvanised Ahmadinejad into a radical move that risks alienating his most religiously devout supporters .
In announcing his intention to appoint three women cabinet members – including Fatemeh Ajorlou as social welfare minister and Marzieh Vahid Dastjerdi as health minister – Ahmadinejad trumped the campaign pledges of his two other election rivals , Mehdi Karroubi and Mohzen Rezai , who each said they would appoint the country 's first female cabinet minister since the 1979 revolution .
But the social pressures prompting the appointments long pre - dated the election campaign .
"" These appointments are a result of the pressure that women 's demands have imposed on the system , "" said Asiyeh Amini , a leading women 's activist .
Female protesters played a prominent role in the unrest after the disputed election , as illustrated by the case of Neda Agha Soltan , the 26-year - old woman who became the symbol of the demonstrations after her death at the hands of a sniper was caught on film and beamed across the world ."
2009-08-16,"Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad today attempted to soften his hardline image by nominating three women to his cabinet following June 's disputed election .
As a new trial began of 25 more activists and opposition supporters , Ahmadinejad named Fatemeh Ajorlou , an MP , as social welfare minister and Marzieh Vahid Dastjerdi as health minister , with a third woman to be named later . ""
With the 10th presidential election , we have entered a new era ...
conditions changed completely and the government [ make - up ] will see major changes , "" Ahmadinejad said on state television .
He also said Heydar Moslehi , his adviser on clerical affairs , would be nominated as intelligence minister .
There were unconfirmed reports that the country 's chief nuclear negotiator , Saeed Jalili , would be named foreign minister .
Like Ahmadinejad , Jalili has taken an uncompromising stance in Iran 's dispute with the west over its nuclear programme , which it defends as being for peaceful purposes .
But it is Ahmadinejad 's intention to have three women ministers that stands out in a society where women politicians are thin on the ground –there are only eight women among Iran 's 290 MPs .
During the election campaign , the defeated reformist candidate , Mir Hossein Mousavi , and his wife , Zahra Rahnavard , who holds a PhD in political science , galvanised younger and female voters with promises to eliminate discrimination against women , abolish the "" morality police "" and "" help the youth to think freely "" .
Rahnavard emerged as the unlikely star of the presidential campaign and clearly unnerved Ahmadinejad , who used a televised debate between the candidates to question the legitimacy of her doctorate .
She astonished the political establishment by accusing him of lying , debasing women and abusing his office , and threatening to sue him .
By seeking to promote women in his cabinet , Ahmadinejad has taken on board the increased political clout of Iranian women , but the appointments – which have to be approved by parliament – are unlikely to appease reformists as both women named by Ahmadinejad are considered hardliners .
Leading reformist Mousavi announced plans at the weekend to create a new political organisation called the Green Path of Hope to restore people 's constitutional rights .
Mousavi said volunteer and social networks would form the mainstay of his organisation without giving details .
The move fleshes out Mousavi 's plans to establish an organisation , short of a party , that would be able to function legally within the current political framework .
Mousavi said the organisation 's goal will be to "" defend the rights and votes of citizens that were crushed in the election "" .
One of Mousavi 's senior aides , Alireza Beheshti , said that forming a new group would enable the 67-year - old to keep up his protests against the results of the presidential election through a new platform .
Following Ahmadinejad 's unexpectedly large majority in the June vote , hundreds of thousands of Mousavi 's supporters , wearing green , took to the streets claiming the election was fraudulent , in defiance of a government ban on political demonstrations .
Hardliners are increasingly calling for Mousavi to be put on trial along with hundreds of the regime 's opponents .
During today 's trial , one of the defendants , Mehrdad Aslani , accused Mousavi of planting the idea of election fraud in the mind of their supporters . ""
Mr Mousavi , do you know there are seats here for you and your friends who were the cause of this plot ?
"" he said .
There have been no official indictments against Mousavi .
Earlier this month Iran held two other trials for more than 100 reformist politicians and activists accused of attempting to overthrow Iran 's Islamic system , including Hossein Rassam , chief political analyst at the British embassy and an Iranian citizen .
The opposition has denounced the trials as a sham ."
2009-08-16,"During the two months since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's election grab , Iran 's human rights situation has worsened , with mass arrests and detentions as well as brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations by various state forces .
On the international level , Iran has further jeopardised its relationship with key western states – notably Britain and France – through allegations of "" interference "" and arrests of local embassy staff as well as their citizenry .
Although mass public protests appear to have died down , a wide cross - section of Iranian society is deeply dissatisfied with the political situation and schisms divide the heart of Iran 's political - religious ruling elite .
Over the last two months , the Iranian state has antagonised and abused thousands of its citizens .
Back in July , Tehran 's prosecutor - general , Qorban - Ali Dorri Najafabadi , acknowledged the arrest of more than 2,500 in the capital alone .
The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran lists some 240 prominent detainees currently held and notes that many of these were arrested by "" unidentified agents and taken to undisclosed locations .
They are mostly held in incommunicado detention and have no access to legal counsel . ""
These actions are in clear violation of the basic rights guaranteed both by Iran 's domestic legal codes and by the international treaties to which Iran is a signatory .
Others arrested well before the current imbroglio , such as Silva Harotonian and Hossein Derakhshan , are still detained .
Many of those detained in prison have allegedly suffered appalling treatment , with multiple reports of beatings , torture and sexual abuse .
Last Sunday in a provocative move , Mehdi Karroubi , the opposition figurehead and a defeated candidate from the June presidential elections , published an open letter detailing the rape and sexual abuse of both male and female prisoners and explicitly comparing such actions to the abuses perpetrated by the late shah 's Savak forces .
Karroubi has now issued a further statement alleging that detained protesters have been tortured and beaten to death .
Amnesty International has warned of an "" alarming spike in executions "" since the disputed election on 12 June .
Amnesty counts at least 196 executions in 2009 before 12 June and a staggering 115 in a period of less than two months , with 24 executions on 5 August alone , the day of Ahmedinejad 's inauguration .
These executions are all the more ghastly given the blatant injustice of the legal process and trials to which Iranian defendants are subjected .
Detained protesters and opposition figures face flagrantly biased trials , often in the revolutionary courts .
On 1 August there was a "" mass trial "" of more than 100 opposition figures which former president Mohammad Khatami condemned as a "" show "" , denouncing the violation of Iran 's constitutional norms .
There have also been attempts by the state to further extend its hegemony through the legal system and to limit structurally the possibilities of lawyers opposing legal violations .
Back on 17 June the judiciary revised the regulations governing membership of the Iranian Bar Association .
Although the decision seems to have since been suspended for six months , the reform was designed to severely compromise the ( already threatened ) independence of the bar association . ""
This so - called reform would allow the government to handpick the lawyers who are allowed to practise …
What we see here is a naked effort to intimidate Iranian defence lawyers at a time when the government is detaining hundreds of people without charge , "" wrote Joe Stork of Human Rights Watch .
The introduction of the reforms was accompanied by a wave of arrests of human rights lawyers including Muhammad Ali Dadkhah ( still currently detained ) , a member of the Defenders of Human Rights Centre , whose current president is the Nobel peace laureate Shirin Ebadi .
Iranian journalists are in a perilous position , with the Committee for the Protection of Journalists calling Iran the "" world 's leading jailer of journalists "" and reporting the forced closure on 5 August of the Association of Iranian Journalists .
There is clearly an intention to intimidate journalists and a source in Tehran reported a deliberate strategy among state security forces of targeting reporters during protests .
Foreign journalists have also been targeted and were banned from attending opposition rallies .
In a highly unusual move , Iason Athanasiadis , a foreign journalist who holds Greek and British citizenship and has written for the Guardian , was arrested and detained for 19 days in solitary confinement .
The situation in Iran presents serious challenges to the entire international community – not just the western world – particularly as fears over Iran 's nuclear programme grow ever greater .
Britain 's decision to send its ambassador to attend Ahmedinejad 's inauguration seems to reflect a pragmatic decision to play "" good cop "" to America 's bad and to keep open lines of communication with Ahmedinejad 's administration .
Engagement , with carrots as well as sticks , remains by far the best option given the inefficacy of further sanctions and the disastrous potential of military strikes .
The international community must continue to highlight the abuses of the Iranian state and the widespread violations of the basic rights of Iranian citizens .
The British public and political elite should petition Iran to respect both international and Iranian legal norms .
Muslim groups must also condemn the abuses conducted by a state claiming to be Islamic : it is depressing indeed that the Muslim Council of Britain is yet to issue a statement on this topic .
Political space in Iran remains surprisingly open despite recent attempts to intimidate and limit the press and public , as well as to intervene in electoral politics .
Vociferous public debate continues , and a range of political opinions are still expressed .
The opposition is powerful , with enormous popular support , and it now includes not just many senior clerics but a selection of the founding fathers of the 1979 revolution .
Change within the system may still be possible but it will take time ."
2009-08-17,"It is difficult to know how to react to the decision by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Iran to propose three women in his new cabinet , two of whom he has already named .
Should I be proud , as an Iranian woman , that for the first time in the history of the Islamic Republic women will be proposed for cabinet posts ?
Well , I wish I could feel proud .
The reality is that if Ahmadinejad had chosen two ultra - hardline conservative men for the same posts it would have made no difference in terms of policy and vision .
He has proposed Fatemeh Ajorlou for the welfare and social security ministry and Marzieh Vahid Dastjerdi for the health ministry .
Both women , as members of Iran 's majlis or parliament , have been advocating draconian changes to family laws and women 's rights laws making it even more difficult for women to benefit from equal rights , get divorced , have custody of their children , or have an abortion if they so choose .
They are both strong supporters of the role of women as pious mothers devoted to Islam , to their duties to their husbands , and to the Islamic republic .
Ajorlou , who is an MP in the present parliament , is a notorious advocate of punishment of women who ignore the dress code .
She is an outspoken supporter of the chador – the head - to - toe black Islamic cover – as the protector of women 's chastity and modesty .
Her professional career has been in serving the Revolutionary Guards and Basij militia .
She worked as a nurse in the Revolutionary Guards and later was influential in setting up the Basij Sisters militia , which has been involved in brutal attacks and arrests of women 's rights activists .
More recently she advocated the controversial draft law for positive discrimination for men in attending universities .
That had become necessary , according to Ajorlou , because girls had won 70 % of university places , thereby causing an "" imbalance "" in society .
More generally she believes that western societies have lost their morality because women have given priority to their jobs rather than their families .
Vahid - Dastjerdi , who was an MP in two previous parliaments , is perhaps , professionally , a suitable candidate for the ministry of health as she has spent most of her career in medical practice and research specialising in women 's infertility .
However , she is another clear hardliner .
During her days as an MP , Vahid - Dastjerdi opposed the bill that could have facilitated Iran joining the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women .
The most intriguing question is why Ahmadinejad has chosen to propose women in his cabinet when he knows full well that the Islamic establishment does not allow women to be "" leaders "" .
While women can work as deputy ministers or as advisers to ministers , there is a serious debate between the reformists and conservatives on whether women can be "" allowed "" to lead an entire ministry .
Perhaps Ahmadinejad is hoping that he would be a winner whatever the outcome .
If the parliament or the Islamic establishment does not approve his choice of women ministers , he could still claim he had tried to raise the status of women .
If they do accept his nominations , then he could champion the cause of womenwhile still having two hardliners in his cabinet .
Ahmadinejad , who has recently witnessed thousands of women marching against his presidency in the streets of Tehran and other major cities , may be wishing to appease women by his cabinet selection .
He tried once before to make it legal for girls to attend football stadiums .
Young girls keen on football welcomed the decision but the Islamic authorities vetoed it .
This time the scenario may be even harsher .
Both women and the Islamic establishment could reject his choice .
With the increasing number of women arrested , imprisoned and killed during his presidency – accused of advocating women 's equal rights –
Ahmadinejad will find it hard to convince women that this latest move is anything but another political show ."
2009-08-21,"A former commander of Iran 's Revolutionary Guards has been nominated by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's president , to head the country 's defence ministry , despite being listed on Interpol 's wanted register for the 1994 bombing of a Jewish cultural centre in Argentina .
Argentinian prosecutors joined Jewish groups last night in condemnation of Ahmadinejad 's decision to propose Ahmad Vahidi for the senior cabinet post .
Vahidi has been on an Interpol "" red notice "" since November 2007 , in connection with the car bomb attack on the Israeli - Argentine Mutual Association ( AMIA ) building in Buenos Aires that killed 85 people and injured 150 – the worst attack on a Jewish target outside Israel since the second world war .
Interpol 's red notices are alerts to its 187 member nations .
They are not arrest warrants but are sometimes interpreted as a request for apprehending a suspect .
At the time of the attack Vahidi , who is currently Iran 's deputy defence minister , commanded a notorious unit of the Revolutionary Guards called the Quds Force .
It is known for orchestrating Iran 's overseas operations including working alongside Lebanon 's Hezbollah militant group , which is accused of carrying out the Buenos Aires attack on the instigation of Iran .
Vahidi 's promotion , which was mooted on Wednesday , will be interpreted as the latest act of defiance of international opinion by Ahmadinejad , as he seeks to cement his hold on power after the fiercely disputed elections in June .
Iranian lawmakers have yet to ratify the 21-member cabinet .
Fears have been voiced that his selections were based on their loyalty rather than experience .
At least four nominees for defence , interior , intelligence and oil minister had ties with the elite Revolutionary Guard , a powerful base of support for the president .
Argentinian prosecutor Alberto Nisman , who led the investigation into the 1994 bombing , yesterday said Vahidi is accused of being "" a key participant in the planning "" of the attack .
"" It has been demonstrated that Vahidi participated in and approved of the decision to attack AMIA during a meeting in Iran on August 14 , 1993 .
Iran has always protected terrorists , giving them government posts , but I think never one as high as this one , "" he told the Associated Press ."
2009-08-28,"President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's list of cabinet nominees reveals a determination to fill the top positions in Iran 's government from a coterie of loyal men , plus three women , many of whom are strongly linked to the Revolutionary Guards ( IRGC ) .
Under Ahmadinejad 's previous administration there was a distinct militarisation of politics : many ministers , as well as ambassadors , mayors , provincial governors and senior bureaucrats , were drawn from the guards .
Ahmadinejad himself is widely associated with the IRGC , but in an interview his adviser insisted that the president had never been a member and was present only "" when necessary "" ( although when pressed the adviser noted that Ahmadinejad 's role included "" logistical support "" and "" war engineering "" during the Iran - Iraq war ) .
Whatever Ahmadinejad 's exact link with the Revolutionary Guards it is clear that they are playing an increasingly significant role in Iranian politics .
The IRGC 's entry into politics dates from long before Ahmadinejad 's ascendancy .
Back in 1997 several of their leaders openly endorsed the conservative presidential candidate Ali Akbar Nateq - Nouri .
Although the reformist Mohammad Khatami won that election , he soon faced strong opposition from the guards .
Their commander , General Rahim Safavi stated in April 1998 that some reformers were munāfiqs ( a particularly highly - charged term for a hypocrite ) and said that those threatening the Islamic republic should be beheaded .
Although Ayatollah Khomeini asked in his will that the military keep out of politics , by May of 1998 Safavi warned that the IRGC were not apolitical and that they would respect one authority above all , the supreme leader .
This alliance between a new wave of conservative politics and the IRGC is well detailed in Anoush Ehteshami and Mahjoub Zweiri 's book , Iran and the Rise of Its Neoconservatives , which carries the prescient subtitle "" the politics of Tehran 's silent revolution "" .
The "" silent revolution "" reached an apex back in June when the IRGC played an instrumental role in the power - grab - cum - coup - d'état that returned Ahmadinejad .
The interior ministry , the body mandated by law to administer elections and which played a significant role in June 's election manipulation , will be headed by Mostafa Mohammad Najjar .
Najjar , defence minister since 2005 , served with the IRGC in Lebanon .
Ahmadinejad 's defence minister nominee is a former guards commander , wanted by Interpol in connection with the 1994 bombing of an Argentine Jewish cultural centre , and his nominee for the intelligence ministry was previously the supreme leader 's representative in the IRGC .
All cabinet posts must be approved by parliament , but given the strong conservative presence there , loyal to Ahmadinejad , it seems likely that these nominees will be accepted .
The Revolutionary Guards also manage and run a business empire reportedly including everything from laser eye - surgery clinics to car manufacturing , from oil and gas field development right through to black - market smuggling .
Although the US treasury suggests the guards control billions of dollars worth of business , construction , finance and commerce , the exact extent their economic empire is unclear : they do not openly report income to the central bank and many of their contracts are awarded without the supposedly mandatory open - bidding process .
As an example of their reach , in July 2007 the energy ministry awarded IRGC contractors all public infrastructure projects in water , electricity and bridges for western Iran .
Since 2005 Ahmadinejad has attempted to push IRGC alumni – even those without requisite political experience – into key economic ministries and above all the important petroleum ministry .
In a cold show of force on May 8 2004 , the Revolutionary Guards occupied Tehran 's new Imam Khomeini airport which had opened just hours before .
The IRGC demanded that the Turkish - Austrian consortium , TAV , then managing the airport be removed , saying that it posed a threat to Iran 's "" security and dignity "" .
The real motivation seemed economic : a company close to the IRGC had lost its bid to operate the airport .
It seems that since January 2008 the IRGC have served as the "" temporary "" operators of Imam Khomeini airport .
The "" silent revolution "" in Tehran has moved Iran ever further from its revolutionary theocratic and republican ideals , towards a militarised security state like so many of its Middle Eastern neighbours .
The Revolutionary Guards ' political head , General Yadollah Javani warned the Iranian public in the aftermath of June 's disputed election that "" today , no one is impartial .
There are two currents ; those who defend and support the revolution and the establishment , and those who are trying to topple it "" .
It seems clear that the majority of the IRGC are firmly supporting the establishment – some would go so far as to suggest that this Praetorian Guard are themselves running the show , albeit from behind the scenes .
It is important however to note that despite a broadly shared conservatism the IRGC does not behave as a monolith .
Mohsen Rezaee , who served as the Guard 's chief commander for 16 years , stood against Ahmadinejad in June 's presidential election and rejected the official results .
Since then he has openly demanded that those who attacked the opposition and tortured detainees be put on trial .
Although Iran increasingly resembles a security state its military picture is fragmented – a legacy of the decision following the 1979 revolution to split the military between the Revolutionary Guards and the larger regular army .
There is also a paramilitary militia , the Basij , now subordinated to the IRGC .
One prominent Iranian analyst speculated with me that Iran 's ultimate capacity to repress its population is limited .
She pointed to the fact that during the widespread protests in June the state only deployed certain forces , perhaps concerned about the loyalty of others – they seemed on occasion unwilling to arm the Basij with more than bricks and stones or to utilise the regular army .
As she saw it , the combined forces of the IRGC and police were strongly tested by the number of protesters marching on the streets ; she was not convinced according to her back - of - envelope calculations that the state had sufficient repressive force to control both the capital and the provinces in the face of widespread insurrection .
Anecdotal reports of police directing people to protest sites add doubt as to their ultimate loyalties .
For the time being it seems the opposition has been terrified off the streets .
The Iranian state 's fierce face should not be taken as a sign of strength but rather the inverse : fundamental weakness .
The political legitimacy of the regime is destroyed and to maintain order they must rely on repression and a culture of fear .
In the meantime the control of key institutions by the Revolutionary Guards ' alumni is steadily increasing ."
2009-09-01,"Here 's an interesting counterpoint to the ongoing Megrahi row .
While the Scottish justice minister has taken all kinds of flak for releasing the Lockerbie bomber , look who Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has just nominated to be his new defence minister ."
2009-09-02,"The Iranian parliament is expected to approve today the nomination for defence secretary of a man wanted in connection with the murder of 85 people at a Jewish centre in Argentina .
General Ahmad Vahidi , who is wanted by Interpol , has been chosen for the post by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad despite international condemnation .
Vahidi faces charges in Argentina over his alleged role in masterminding the bombing of a Jewish centre in Buenos Aires in 1994 .
At the time , Vahidi was the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard 's al - Quds force .
His nomination triggered an uproar in Argentina , but the Iranian parliament , the majlis , signalled its defiance yesterday as deputies chanted "" death to Israel "" when Vahidi addressed the chamber .
One member of parliament , Hadi Qavami , interrupted a speech by Vahidi to say he had initially opposed his nomination but had changed his mind after "" the Zionists ' allegations "" and would now vote for him .
Under parliamentary rules , two MPs can take the floor to oppose a ministerial nominee .
No one did in the case of Vahidi , a sign the legislature will back him .
Vahidi said his country faced numerous security challenges , including the Israeli military , and he would improve Iran 's defences and modernise its military .
The Argentinian government has condemned Vahidi 's nomination as an affront to its legal system and to the relatives of the 85 victims and 150 wounded .
Vahidi has been on an Interpol "" red notice "" since November 2007 in connection with the car bomb attack on the Israeli - Argentine Mutual Association ( Amia ) building in Buenos Aires , the worst attack on a Jewish target outside Israel since the second world war .
Interpol 's red notices are alerts to its 187 member nations .
They are not arrest warrants but are sometimes interpreted that way .
Guillermo Borger , an Amia spokesman , said the nomination was "" shameful and insulting "" , according to La Nación newspaper .

"" It has been demonstrated that Vahidi participated in and approved of the decision to attack Amia during a meeting in Iran on August 14 1993 .

2009-09-03,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took an important step today towards consolidating his power in the wake of disputed elections , winning parliamentary support for most of his new cabinet , including a defence minister wanted in connection with a terrorist attack in Argentina 15 years ago .
Ahmadinejad presented the vote , which confirmed 18 of his ministerial nominees , as a "" crushing response "" to pressure from western powers , whom he has accused of backing post - election protests .
Bolstered by the unexpectedly strong show of support in the parliament , or majlis , he shrugged off the threat of further sanctions over Iran 's nuclear programme . ""
No one can impose sanctions against Iran any more .
We welcome sanctions , "" he told reporters .
The approval of a hardline cabinet to underpin Ahmadinejad 's second term is the latest sign of the conservative faction consolidating its position after two turbulent months in which the Iranian regime was shaken by the force of opposition protests at the incumbent 's re - election .
The severity of the crackdown angered some conservatives as well as moderates in the political establishment , and many observers predicted Ahmadinejad would have problems gaining parliamentary endorsement for his new government .
Today , however , the parliament voted in support of all but three of the nominees , including a defence minister , Ahmad Vahidi , who faces charges in Argentina for his alleged role in the bombing of a Buenos Aires Jewish cultural centre in 1994 .
Vahidi won 227 out of 286 votes , more than any other nominee .
Vahidi promised parliament : "" All those who act against Iran will face the iron fist of the Iranian government , nation and armed forces . ""
Marzieh Vahid Dastjerdi also won approval as health minister , making her Iran 's first woman minister since the Islamic revolution .
"" I think today women reached their long - standing dream of having a woman in the cabinet to pursue their demands , "" Dastjerdi said "" This is an important step for women and I hold my head high . ""
Ahmadinejad himself claimed that Iran had delivered a package of proposals for nuclear talks , but diplomats in Brussels , London and Washington said no such proposals had been received .
Iran has so far defied UN security council resolutions calling on it to suspend the enrichment of uranium , which Tehran insists is for peaceful purposes .
Envoys from six major powers met in Germany on Wednesday to discuss the Iranian nuclear standoff and gave Tehran until the end of the month to respond to an invitation for talks , or face further sanctions .
The deadline will expire at the UN general assembly debate beginning on 23 September , which is expected to be attended by both Ahmadinejad and Barack Obama .
However , it remains unclear whether tougher UN sanctions will follow that deadline .
Russia and China remain resistant to punitive measures being pushed by the US , Britain , France and – increasingly – Germany , but they are said to be pushing Tehran to enter substantive talks on enrichment in the next few weeks .
A meeting of foreign ministers from the six - nation group , known as the E3 + 3 , is provisionally planned for the week of the general assembly , to assess Iran 's response , or lack of response .
Ahmadinejad will be making his first foray into the west since the June elections .
The new cabinet is packed with hardline Ahmadinejad loyalists , helping to consolidate his hold on the levers of power .
Heidar Moslehi , an acolyte of the president , was made intelligence minister following a purge of officials who had questioned the post - election crackdown .
However , it was not an outright victory for Ahmadinejad .
Two other women nominees , for the health and social welfare ministries , were voted down , as well as his choice for the energy ministry . ""
He 's won the battle but not the war .
This does not mean this is going to be a rubber stamp majlis , "" said Meir Javedanfar , the head of the Middle East Economic and Political Analysis thinktank .
"" But it was a surprise .
Many people were expecting bigger opposition from the parliament . """

2009-09-07,"A new round of international sanctions against Iran looked almost inevitable today after the head of the UN 's nuclear watchdog , Mohamed ElBaradei , said talks with the Islamic republic were at a "" stalemate "" , and the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , appeared to rule out a compromise .
ElBaradei delivered a despairing account of Iran 's nuclear compliance at a board meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , but he also ignited a simmering row with France and Israel , when he accused "" some member states "" of making "" politically motivated "" allegations against him .
French and Israeli officials have both accused ElBaradei of suppressing damning evidence of Iranian attempts to build nuclear weapons .
ElBaradei rejected that claim , saying he had presented all the evidence that had been properly checked in his report on Iran .
But the French foreign ministry stuck to its position this afternoon , saying : "" France attended a technical briefing at the agency open to all member states .
Not all that information was reflected in the report .
"" The row came as Iran appeared to close the door on compromise over its uranium enrichment programme .
Speaking to journalists , Ahmadinejad told journalists in Tehran that "" from our point of view , Iran 's nuclear issue is over .
"" We will never negotiate over the obvious rights of the Iranian nation , "" he said , a clear signal that his government was not prepared to suspend the enrichment of uranium , as demanded by the UN security council .
Tehran has been given until the UN general assembly , at the end of this month , to respond to an offer of a compromise over its uranium enrichment .
Ahmadinejad made clear he was willing to talk broadly about "" global challenges "" , but not about enrichment .
The Iranian president said his country would continue to have routine talks with the IAEA .
But in his report to the agency 's board , ElBaradei said Iran had failed to answer questions arising from evidence suggesting it had at least contemplated the design of a warhead .
In his speech to the board , ElBaradei noted that Tehran had made two recent concessions : allowing his inspectors access to a heavy water nuclear reactor at Arak , and agreeing to improve monitoring at the uranium enrichment plant at Natanz .
But he added : "" On all other issues relevant to Iran 's nuclear programme , however , there is stalemate .
Iran has not suspended its enrichment - related activities or its work on heavy water - related projects as required by the security council . ""
Likewise , Iran has not co - operated with the agency in connection with the remaining issues , detailed fully and completely in the agency 's reports , which need to be clarified in order to exclude the possibility of there being military dimensions to Iran 's nuclear programme .
"" The outgoing director general , who will leave his post at the end of November , combined his criticism of Iran with an outspoken attack on states he believes have briefed against him .

2009-09-08,"Rightwing US commentators were outraged when Oliver Stone took to the red carpet in Venice this week with Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez , the main subject of Stone 's latest documentary feature .
One can only imagine their response if he manages to pull off his next plan : an interview film with Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
South of the Border , which premiered on Monday at Venice , began as an interview film with Chávez , whose economic and diplomatic policies have provoked hostility from many US politicians and media outlets .
Some have compared him to Osama bin Laden .
Stone 's film includes interviews with seven South American presidents , all of whom express dissatisfaction with US policy . ""
Leader after leader seemed to be saying the same thing , "" Stone wrote in the Guardian last week .
"" Americans must question the role of our media in demonising foreign leaders as our enemies . ""
Venezuelan state television showed Chávez on the Lido red carpet . ""
Oliver Stone is a genius of cinema , "" he told reporters , according to Bloomberg.com .
"" I think he could smell the air of change in South America . ""
Meanwhile , Stone 's plans to interview Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad are apparently still on track .
In 2007 , Stone requested permission to make the documentary in Iran and was given a provisional green light , despite being initially rejected as "" a part of the Great Satan "" .
Since then , Ahmadinejad has become an even more divisive figure since the escalation of Iran 's nuclear programme and public disorder , following his declaration of victory in this year 's presidential elections .

2009-09-18,"Iran 's opposition Green movement put on a powerful show of strength today against Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as the hardline president repeated his notorious claim that the Nazi Holocaust was a "" lie "" designed to justify the existence of Israel .
Tens of thousands of people gathered in central Tehran to shout "" death to the dictator "" despite a heavy security presence and official warnings to the opposition not to hijack the Quds ( Jerusalem )
Day rally , the regime 's annual display of solidarity with the Palestinians .
Ahmadinejad supporters mounted counter - demonstrations , leading to repeated scuffles between the two sides , news agencies reported .
Mir Hossein Mousavi , who claims he won June 's election , was forced to abandon plans to take part after his car was attacked .
Former president Mohammad Khatami , another leading reformist , was also said to have been assaulted by hardliners before being rescued by riot police .
Reformist leaders , including senior clerics , had called for a big turnout for an important public event the regime would not want to cancel , amid a sense that the Mousavi camp is anxious to maintain momentum in the face of repression by a regime whose legitimacy has been badly damaged by the "" theft "" of the presidential election .
Ahmadinejad , who is due to address the UN general assembly in New York next week as focus on Iran 's nuclear ambitions intensifies , risked further western hostility by repeating his beliefs about the Nazi extermination of 6 million Jews .
"" They [ western powers ] launched the myth of the Holocaust , "" he told a crowd at Tehran university . ""
They lied , they put on a show and then they support the Jews , "" he said to chants of "" Death to Israel "" from supporters .
""
The pretext for establishing the Zionist regime is a lie … a lie which relies on an unreliable claim , a mythical claim , and the occupation of Palestine has nothing to do with the Holocaust . ""
Ahmadinejad 's speech suggested a defiant attitude abroad as well as at home .
Strikingly , one of the strongest calls for opposition participation in the Quds Day protests came from Hojatolleslam Sayyed Hassan Khomeini , grandson of Ayatollah Khomeini , leader of the 1979 Islamic revolution .
In a thinly disguised rebuke to the hardliners , Khomeini called Quds Day "" a day for the oppressed to resist against the oppressors "" , implying that it is also a day of protest against repression and oppression in Iran .
People in the crowd were more explicit , chanting : "" Not Gaza , Not Lebanon .
We are ready to die for Iran . """
2009-09-19,"Live television coverage of an Iranian football match was blacked - out because sections of the crowd were chanting anti - government slogans and waving green emblems in support of the country 's political opposition , it was claimed yesterday .
The premier league match between Esteghlal and Steel Azin took place at Tehran 's Azadi stadium just hours after tens of thousands of green - clad protesters used the state - organised Quds Day anti - Israel demonstrations to voice their opposition to the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who is accused of stealing Iran 's recent election .
The game 's scheduled live TV coverage was disrupted apparently after bosses of the state broadcaster , Irib , learned of the presence of protesters inside the stadium .
According to Iranian websites , the match was initially broadcast for a few minutes in black - and - white without crowd noise to show that technical problems were being experienced .
The transmission then cut back to a studio presenter who said that the problems had arisen because Irib had "" sent only one camera to the stadium "" .
Eventually the match was shown nearly an hour late , again without sound and with close - up shots focusing solely on the pitch and editing out the 70,000 spectators .
The news website Mehr described the live broadcast failure as "" unprecedented "" .
Aziz Mohammadi , the head of Iran 's premier league , blamed it on Esteghlal 's refusal to agree to a 15-minute kick - off delay to give extra preparation time to cameramen who , he said , had been under added pressure because of the earlier coverage of Quds Day .
However , that explanation was dismissed by club bosses who said Irib had cited "" technical problems "" throughout the match .
The Mizan Press website – linked to the opposition National Religious party – said the real reason was the presence of supporters of Mir Hossein Mousavi , the reformist who says Ahmadinejad cheated him of victory in June .
"" Following the self - motivated presence of the green wave in Azadi stadium , Irib did not cover live the Esteghlal - Steel Azin match , "" it wrote .
"" Irib 's lie about camera malfunction and receiving only black - and - white images from inside the stadium was uncovered an hour later by the colour transmission using close - up and specially edited frames .
In these images the spectators were not shown at all . ""
Suspicions that the broadcast was delayed deliberately were bolstered by reports from listeners who said they heard chants in support of Mousavi during a live radio broadcast of the game .
It was the second time on Friday that TV bosses had been blindsided by opposition protests .
Hours earlier , Ahmadinejad was publicly embarrassed during a live interview when opposition chants of "" Ahmadi , Ahmadi , resign , resign "" could clearly be heard while he was speaking .
The incident also exposed the authorities ' sensitivity to expressions of dissent in sporting arenas , especially football , which has an avid following in Iran .
Days after the disputed election , four members of Iran 's national team were banned from the game after displaying their support for Mousavi by wearing green wristbands during a World Cup qualifying match against South Korea .
Last month eyebrows were raised when two premier league teams abandoned their green strips and took the field against each other in predominantly white outfits .
The green shirts of the women 's national team were withdrawn and replaced with red tops on the eve of the recent Asian Games championship in Thailand .

Some are said to have been punished for relatively innocuous activities such as protesting about the quality of food .
The penalties were handed out after students were summoned by campus officers during the summer break .
Officials are believed to fear an outbreak of campus unrest that could reignite the widespread nationwide demonstrations that followed June 's poll , which Ahmadinejad won amid accusations from opponents of widespread fraud .
However , student leaders say they will not be harassed into silence and will continue their activities .
"" We predict the protests will continue in the universities , "" said Bahareh Hedayat , a member of the central committee of Tahkim - e Vahdat , the biggest student group .
In the days after the election , security forces launched attacks on students at several universities .
Eight students are believed to have died in one such attack at Tehran University .
Last week three activists at the university were arrested and taken to the city 's Evin prison , according to the student website AUTnews .
The latest clampdown has also targeted those at provincial institutions .
One university , Mohaghegh Ardabili in the northern city of Ardebil , which was reported to have been free of post - election unrest , suspended several students after learning they had worked on the campaigns of the defeated reformist candidates Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi .
Eleven students at Razi University in the western city of Kermanshah were given various punishments including suspensions , fines and being deprived of campus facilities after being found guilty of "" disrupting order and damaging university assets "" .
Similar reports have come from other provincial universities , including Bushehr , where the parents of students have been called before the authorities , and Babol in the Caspian province of Mazandaran , where three students were sentenced to 10 months in prison ."
2009-09-23,"11.20am : It could be the most important general assembly meeting for years with climate change , the Middle East crisis and the global recession all high on the agenda , and a speech by a US president who takes the UN seriously .
We are going to guide you through the speeches , power meetings and diplomatic snubs .
And we 'll update you on a number of intriguing subplots :
Gaddafi and his tent ; a threatened walkout of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's speech ; and an appearance of the newly crowned world statesman of the year , Gordon Brown .
11.52am :
The assembly meeting does n't start until 2 pm ( 9 am local time ) and there 's been intense jockeying for position .
•
The White House has released excerpts of Obama 's speech in which he warns that America can not act alone in tackling the world 's problems .
•
Germany has said it will walk out of the meeting if Ahmadinejad denies the Holocaust as he did on Friday .
And the Iranian leader has given a defiant an interview to AP .
•
In article in the New York Times , Gordon Brown has set out his hopes for deal on climate change and a new nuclear nonproliferation agreement .
•
The batting order for the world leader 's speeches starts with an opening partnership of Brazilian president Lula and Obama with Colonel Gadiffi coming in at number three .
Brown has the tricky slot of last speaker before lunch .
One of the afternoon speakers is the ousted Honduran president Manuel Zelaya , but he is otherwise engaged - holed up in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa .
12.20pm :
Relatives of the victims of the Lockerbie bombing are planning to protest as Gaddafi speaks , according to the BBC .
The Guardian has published a new gallery of Gaddafi and his travelling tent .

Speaking to the broadcaster ABC
she said the Obama administration 's approach to Afghanistan "" may have to be adjusted "" to reflect the changing military , political and economic realities .
1.00pm :
Keeping world leader 's to time can often been tricky .
There 's been a history of long - winded speeches to the UN general assembly notably from the former Cuban leader Fidel Castro .
With Gaddafi , Ahmadinejad and Zimbabwe 's president Robert Mugabe all due to speak , time keeping could well be a problem again .
Leaders are expected to keep their comments to just five minutes with the exception of Obama because he 's going first , and as Ewen MacAskill points out , he 's the president of the solo superpower .
But the organisers have allowed for speeches to run over time .
In the morning session 14 world leaders are due to speak .
As the session lasts for four and half hours that gives them almost 20 minutes each , according to my maths .
1.16pm :
The Pittsburgh G20 Summit , which starts after the UN meeting , has released tantalising details of the "" spousal program "" .
Michelle Obama will welcome the wives , girlfriends , and the odd first husband , to a dinner tomorrow night at the Rosemont Farm , home of Teresa Heinz the philanthropist and wife of former US presidential candidate John Kerry .
There they will be entertained by a Jazz trio and eat some of the produce of the farm .
On Friday they will treated to a school musical version of Les Miserables and performances by the cellist Yo - Yo Ma and country musician Trisha Yearwood .
They 'll also be going to Pittsburgh Andy Warhol Museum .
1.38pm :
The United Nations webcast is showing delegates arriving for the meeting .
They have cameras at the top of escalator and behind a revolving door .
CNN 's Ted Turner has just arrived .
Does he count as a world leader ?
1.48pm :
If Gordon Brown wants to work towards a nuclear - free world , much more needs to be on the table than a solitary submarine , argues John Gittings on Comment is Free .
2.01pm :
Ban Ki - moon ( or someone on his behalf ) has posted a Twitter update : "" Attending the Opening of the General Debate , "" the UN secretary general tweets .
The meeting seems to be running a little late .
CBS Radio says Obama wo n't be speaking until 10 am ( 3 pm BST ) .
2.08pm : The meeting is under way , and Ban is about to present his annual report .
Ban calls for concerted action on the challenges of food , energy , recession and pandemic flu .

2.46pm :
Gaddafi has taken his seat as the general debate is about to begin .
Treki urges speakers to keep their speeches to a maximum of 15 minutes .
2.48pm :
You can watch now watch the debate on a live stream on the Guardian 's site .
2.51pm :
Brazil 's president , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , has started his speech ( Obama is next ) .
Lula condemns the doctrine that markets can look after themselves without regulation .
Controlling the economic crisis could not be left to the "" usual few "" , he says .
He also condemns the coup in Honduras , to warm applause .
"" Funding to protect the environment in developing countries is woefully insufficient , "" Lula adds .
He also for a new world order that is sustainable and democratic .
3.09pm : Obama has been called to the floor .
He is applauded almost as soon as he opens his mouth .
"" I 'm well aware of the expectations of my presidency around the world , "" he says .
He complains of a "" reflexive "" anti - Americanism around the world , that can act as an excuse .
3.14pm : "" Look at the concrete actions we have taken in the first nine months of office "" Obama urged .
He cites the closure of the Guantanamo bay detention camp , the ban on torture ; measures to tackle climate change , and a commitment to a two state solution in the Middle East .
He also talked about America 's renewed commitment to the UN .
Here 's the
but :
"" Those who used to chastise America for acting alone in the world can not now stand by and wait for America to solve the world 's problems alone . ""
3.21pm : Obama urges world leaders not to use the UN to "" play politics "" and "" stoke divisions "" .
3.28pm :
Tough talking on Iran and North Korea : "" If the governments of Iran and North Korea choose to ignore international standards ; if they put the pursuit of nuclear weapons ahead of regional stability and the security and opportunity of their own people ; if they are oblivious to the dangers of escalating nuclear arms races in both East Asia and the Middle East – then they must be held accountable .
The world must stand together to demonstrate that international law is not an empty promise , and that Treaties will be enforced .
We must insist that the future not belong to fear . ""
3.30pm :
On terrorism and Afghanistan Obama says : "" We will permit no safe - haven for al Qaida to launch attacks from Afghanistam "" .
On Israel and Palestine he says : We have made some progress .
Palestinians have strengthened their efforts on security .
Israelis have facilitated greater freedom of movement for the Palestinians .
As a result of these efforts by both sides , the economy in the West Bank has begun to grow .
But more progress is needed .
We continue to call on Palestinians to end incitement against Israel , and we continue to emphasize that America does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements .
The time has come to re - launch negotiations – without preconditions – that address the permanent - status issues : security for Israelis and Palestinians ; borders , refugees and Jerusalem .
The goal is clear : two states living side by side in peace and security – a Jewish State of Israel , with true security for all Israelis ; and a viable , independent Palestinian state with contiguous territory that ends the occupation that began in 1967 , and realizes the potential of the Palestinian people .
3.41pm :
His Wordle version of Obama 's 5,000 word speech .
3.43pm : Obama spells out his difference with the neo - cons of the previous adminstration .
Democracy can not be imposed on any nation from the outside .
Each society must search for its own path , and no path is perfect .
Each country will pursue a path rooted in the culture of its people , and – in the past – America has too often been selective in its promotion of democracy .
But that does not weaken our commitment , it only reinforces it .
There are basic principles that are universal ; there are certain truths which are self evident – and the United States of America will never waiver in our efforts to stand up for the right of people everywhere to determine their own destiny .
3.48pm : Obama closes with this : The United States stands ready to begin a new chapter of international cooperation – one that recognizes the rights and responsibilities of all nations .
With confidence in our cause , and with a commitment to our values , we call on all nations to join us in building the future that our people deserve .
The speech lasted for 38 minutes .
The applause went on for less than a minute .
3.50pm :
Gaddafi is next up , but lots of delegates are now leaving the hall .
Treki appeals to them to be seated .
Gaddafi is in no hurry to get to the stand .
My colleague Daniel Nasaw overheard Ban saying to Treki , "" There 's a danger of this for anybody who speaks after ... ""
Treki butted in : "" After the US , yes . ""
Ed Pilkington in New York reports : "" Obama is now leaving the UN building .
US presidents do n't usually hang around after their addresses but this departure is particularly poignant because Gadaffi is about to take the podium . ""
"" There is an unexplained delay in getting Gaddafi up onto the stage .
The presiding UN people are desperately banging their gavels but to no avail .
Gadafy appears to be having a fine time chatting to his friends at his seat within the assembly hall .
When will the chaos end ? ""
3.59pm :
The Guardian 's diplomatic editor , Julian Borger , picks out Obama 's pledge of radical cuts in America 's nuclear arsenal .
4.01pm :
Gaddafi finally takes to the podium and suggests that swine flu was created for military purposes .
He brandishes a preamble to the original UN charter and begins to read passages from it .
I 'm not sure where he is going with this , but it could be some time .
His point is that countries can not unilaterally act against the sovereignty of other nations .
He says the UN has failed to protect the sovereignty of countries in the face of aggressive wars in 65 cases .
4.18pm :
Daniel Nasaw in Washington , taking over .
Thanks Matt and thanks everyone for your comments .
Now well over his time limit , Gaddafi is working up a head of steam .
It sounds like the English - feed translator is having trouble keeping up .
Anyone else having that trouble ?
4.20pm :
"" We are like the Hyde Park , "" Gaddafi said .
"" You are like Hyde Park "" .
I think he means that the non - security council members are like ranters at the Speakers Corner in London 's Hyde Park , railing to no effect .
"" You just make a speech and then you disappear , "" Gaddafi said .
The remark got a good chuckle from the Chinese delegation .
China is a permanent security council member .
4.25pm :
Gaddafi : "" We can not have the security council under countries which have nuclear powers .
This is terrorism itself . ""
4.28pm :
Gaddafi : "" It should not be called the security council , it should be called the terror council . ""
4.34pm :
Our correspondent Ed Pilkington tells me : Delegations are now coming back into the assembly hall .
They must have calculated that Gaddafi – whose speech has already stretched to twice its 15 minute allotted time – is about to step down and that its safe now to go back in .
4.38pm :
Gaddafi is now complaining that UN nuclear inspectors never visit nuclear facilities at the permanent five countries .
4.39pm :
Gaddafi just called for a permanent seat on the security council for the African Union .
The remark got what may have been Gaddafi 's first round of applause – from delegations from a handful of African states .
He invites anyone who disagrees to debate him – right there on the general assembly floor .
4.41pm :
Gaddafi has now been speaking longer than Obama .
4.43pm :
Ed Pilkington writes : "" Gaddafi has now talked for almost three times his allotted time - he is approaching 45 minutes - and there is no sign of any let up .
He has just launched into a discourse on european colonialism , calling for Africa to have the world that was theirs but neutered back again . ""
4.59pm :
Now nearing the end of his first hour , Gaddafi proposes moving the next general assembly to Beijing or Delhi so visiting delegations will not have to submit to onerous security requirements .
5.03pm :
Pilkington writes : "" It is quite conceivable now that he will carry on talking all day .
There is no sign of the UN taking any action to stop him .
Will he finally be rugby tackled and dragged off by the Secret Service ? ""
5.18pm :
Gaddafi condemns invervention in conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan , reminding the world that no one intervened in the US civil war in the 19th century .
5.19pm :
Gaddafi demands to know who killed John Kennedy in 1963 .
He acknowledges that Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shot and Jack Ruby then killed him , but he wants the truth . ""
Seriously , we do n't know , "" he said .
5.22pm :
The leader of the Libyan Revolution , the King of Kings , the Colonel , shows no sign of letting up .
The entire roster of speakers was scheduled to be concluded by now .
Meanwhile , here is a link to Obama 's speech this morning .
5.26pm :
Gaddafy makes a good point about the root cause of Somali piracy , putting it down to a reaction to overfishing in Somali territorial waters by industrialised nations .
It is hard to tell through the simultaneous translation if Gaddafi is joking or not , but he just warned of an imminent "" fish flu "" for which industrialised nations will soon sell vaccines .
5.30pm :
Gaddafi just plugged his website
"" Gaddafi Speaks "" .
A new translator , a woman , has taken over the English feed .
She has a pleasant voice and a milder accent .
Someone buy a drink for the guy who just got off the clock .
5.33pm :
He 's done !
Gaddafi leaves with a blessing , an hour and 30 minutes after he started .
A UN official hustles over to remove his notes from the rostrum .
"" I wanted to stay until the bitter end
and I think we 're there , "" CNN presenter Tony Harris deadpans .
6.39pm :
Guardian America editor Mike Tomasky thinks Obama 's speech this morning was admirable and bold , but he had the political capital to go much further .
6.47pm :
The United Nations general assembly seats member states in alphabetical order , beginning with Afghanistan and ending with Zimbabwe .
It is an effort to avoid the myriad possible unhappy combinations of seat mates and accusations of favouritism that have plagued anyone who has drawn up the seating chart for a quarrelsome family reunion or a belligerent grade school class .
But as neutral as the plan sounds , it has made for some uncomfortable neighbours .
The delegations sit two to a desk .
Long - time enemies Iran and Iraq share one , glaring at one another and presumably making no plans for a trip to the cafe when the proceedings end .
Israel is separated from Iraq only by Ireland , while the Jewish state is directly in front of Lebanon , well within spit ball range .
Eritrea and Ethiopia have been fighting on and off since 1962 ; at the UN , they are separated only by Estonia .
The seating chart effectively ensures some close mates can not whisper to one another or pass notes while , say , Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi speculates about the Kennedy assassination and complains of jet lag .
Canada sits right in the front , while the United Kingdom and the United States are four rows from the rear , separated by an aisle and the United Republic of Tanzania .
The chart gives plenty of opportunity for comedic hijinks .
Austria and Australia probably get one another 's mail .
Do Sweden and Switzerland argue about who is more neutral and who has the best ski slopes ?
And what of the odd couple pairing of Burundi and the Vatican ?
The latter sits in a corner in the rear , out of alphabetical order , due to its special observer status , next to the delegation from Palestine .
6.54pm :
The Guardian 's team of writers weighs in on the morning 's proceedings .
David Hearst analyses Obama 's speech and finds pointed language aimed at China , Germany , Russia and Binyamin Netanyahu .
Security editor Richard Norton - Taylor writes that Gordon Brown 's intention to cut the number of nuclear submarines is not real disarmament , but an easy way to grab headlines .
Guardian America Editor Michael Tomasky thinks that Gaddafi is actually out of his mind .
On Comment is free , Madeleine Bunting says the UN must do more on maternal mortality .
7.34pm :
Labour MP John Leslie Prescott , the EU negotiator at Kyoto , says policy makers must resist NIMBYs who want renewable energy so long as the windmills do n't obstruct their views .
Guardian environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg says behind Sarkozy 's big rhetoric on fighting climate change was a proposal for ... another conference .
7.42pm :
Obama does some more speechifying , this time at a lunch for heads of state and government hosted by Ban Ki - moon .
After encouraging the delegates to do some shopping and eat out while they are in New York , he said : Progress will not come without setbacks , and cooperation does not come without debate and disagreement .
And this institution will be what we make of it .
So on this September day , I would like to offer a toast to what can be in the years to come -- a place where we forge common ground and recognize our common humanity , a source of moral authority , a force for peace , and above all , an indispensible institution in helping all of us build a better future for our children and our grandchildren .
To the United Nations .
7.51pm :
The Guardian 's New York correspondent Ed Pilkington said Gaddafi lived up to his reputation for "" eccentricity , bloodymindedness and extreme verbiage "" today at the UN , grabbing his 15 minutes of fame and running with it .
7.54pm :
James Acton and George Perkovich of the Carnegie endowment for international peace write that in getting the UN security council to unite against nuclear proliferation , Obama has succeeded where his predecessor Bush failed .
The Bush administration could never have gotten the security council to agree to this draft .
Many of the 12 non - nuclear weapon states on the council – including Mexico , Libya and Vietnam – accept it only because it embraces the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons and because they believe Obama 's commitment to take practical steps toward that end .
8.22pm :
Gordon Brown is taking the rostrum now .
8.22pm :
Brown opens with a barb at Gaddafi , to applause .
"" I come here to reaffirm the UN charter , not to tear it up , "" he said .
8.39pm :
Brown just wrapped up a sober , workman - like speech ( compared to Obama and Gaddafi , certainly ) .
Key points : The body can draw strength from the unity the world has enjoyed over the last year , especially on economic stimulus and banking measures , but member states musn't become complacent .
As the world economy recovers , he predicts a trying six months ahead for international cooperation .
A safer Afghanistan means a safer world , he said , but the world will be in danger if Nato and its partners walk away from the country .
Those countries must press for "" Afghanisation "" of the conflict , turning over security to Afghan police and military forces .
Some things that "" shame us all "" :
The people of Somalia and the SUdan are still subject to violence ; Israel and Palestine are still at it ; an elected Burmese leader ( presumably Aung San Suu Kyi ) was recently subjected to a show trial and imprisoned .
The major threat against world peace : Nuclear proliferation .
Nine countries now have nuclear weapons , up from five .
The danger is more will acquire nukes and terrorists will get them .
Tomorrow 's security council resolution on non proliferation will be vital toward moving the body toward next year 's conference on the matter .
"" Iran and North Korea must now know that the world will be even tougher on proliferation , "" he said .
"" Britain is ready to consider further sanctions . ""
The onus is on those countries , and presumably others , to prove they are not developing nuclear weapons but are seeking peaceful nuclear energy .
Britain will supply peaceful nuclear technology and will sponsor a "" uranium bank "" to provide fuel . ""
All nuclear weapons states must reciprocally play their part to reduce nuclear weapons , "" he said .
Britain 's part : The country will reduce the number of nuclear weapons submarines in Britain 's fleet to three from four .
8.49pm :
Here is Guardian political editor Patrick Wintour 's write - up of Brown 's address . ... and Washington bureau chief Ewen MacAskill on Obama 's .
8.53pm :
The Guardian production team put together a slide show from Gaddafi 's talk earlier .
9.37pm :
Timothy Garton Ash writes the UN , the US , EU , and Israel can do little more than follow the hypocratic when it comes to Iran : Do no harm , and avoid bolstering the regime .
A textbook example of what democracies should not do was provided last year by a joint venture between Siemens and Nokia , called Nokia Siemens Networks .
It sold the Iranian regime a sophisticated system with which they can monitor the internet , including emails , internet phone calls and social - networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter , much used by Iranian protesters .
In today 's politics of people power , that is the equivalent of selling a dictator tanks or poison gas .
So , to be clear : a German company , Siemens , which used slave labour during the Third Reich , sold a Holocaust - denying president the instruments with which he can persecute young Iranians risking their lives for freedom .
Think of that every time you buy something made by Siemens .
9.49pm :
The White House press corps today pushed press secretary Robert Gibbs for a reaction to Gaddafi 's speech .
He declined , taking the bait only when queried on Gaddafi 's remark that he wished Obama could stay president for life and forever . ""
Leaving aside the amendments in the Constitution which the President agrees with wholeheartedly , "" Gibbs said , "" it would be an interesting concept to continue being President beyond one 's natural - born life . ""
10.06pm
: That 's it for tonight .
Thanks everyone for your comments ."
2009-09-24,
2009-09-24,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , faced a series of walkouts at the United Nations general assembly last night after launching a renewed attack on Israel , which he accused of genocide , barbarism and racism .
Within minutes of his criticism of Israel for its treatment of the Palestinians , delegations from various countries began to rise from their seats and noisily left the chamber .
Many other countries had left before he even began , partly because it was the evening and partly in protest over his brutal crackdown on the Iranian opposition after June 's election and partly over comments last week again questioning whether the Holocaust had taken place .
When he finished , he was given a loud round of applause by many of those still in the chamber .
During a 35-minute speech , he asked : "" How can one allow the inhumane behaviour in Palestine to continue ? ""
The Israelis had occupied Palestinian land and the international community portrayed the victims as terrorists , he said .
The Palestinians had suffered from attacks on defenceless women and children , seen their homes destroyed and faced an economic blockade in Gaza that amounted to genocide .
He described Israeli attacks on Gaza as barbaric .
He suggested that Israel could get away with this because of extensive lobbying and political influence in the US and Europe .
"" It is unacceptable that a small minority should dominate large parts of the world through a complex network in the US and Europe to retain its racist ambitions , "" Ahmadinejad said .
Outside the UN , hundreds of protesters wearing the green of the Iranian opposition demonstrated against Ahmadinejad over his domestic crackdown and allegations that he had rigged the election results .
On domestic affairs , Ahmadinejad insisted he won a "" large majority "" in June elections .
Pro - reform opposition politicians have alleged electoral fraud , and Ahmadinejad has been at the centre of political turmoil since then .
"" Our nation has gone through a glorious and fully democratic election , opening a new chapter for our country in the march towards national progress and enhanced international interactions , "" he said , adding that Iranian voters "" entrusted me once more with a large majority "" .
Ahmadinejad , on his fifth visit to the general assembly , appeared to revel in his status as the pariah - in - chief for US and European governments .
As well as attacking Israel , he appeared to criticise President Barack Obama , suggesting that some of his policies were not fundamentally different from George Bush .
"" Attacks on Afghanistan and Pakistan are still going on .
Guantánamo has still not been closed and there are still secret prisons in Europe , "" he said .
At times , Ahmadinejad struck a softer tone , declaring that Tehran was "" prepared to warmly shake all those hands which are honestly extended to us . ""
He peppered his speech with religious references , invoking the prophets of Judaism and Christianity , as well as Islam .
He began speaking only minutes after a meeting ended at the UN to discuss Iran 's nuclear programme .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , met her counterparts from the UK , France , Germany , Russia and China to discuss talks with Iran planned for next week and the possibility of expanding sanctions against Tehran if it refuses to comply with demands to drop its uranium enrichment programme .
Iran denies it is seeking a nuclear weapon .
Ahmadinejad made no reference to Iran 's nuclear programme last night .
As well as his speech to the general assembly , he gave a round of interviews yesterday to CBS television and the Associated Press , in which he refused to acknowledge the Holocaust and asked what it had to do with the Palestinians ."
2009-09-24,"The Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu held up original copies of Nazi plans for the Holocaust at the UN general assembly today as he condemned the Iranian leader , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The documents were intended as a dramatic and emotional counter to Ahmadinejad 's expression of doubts last week over whether the Holocaust had happened .
"" Is this protocol a lie ? ""
Netanyahu asked as he displayed a copy of the Wannsee agreement in which the Nazis set out their plans for the extermination of Jews in Europe .
He also held up a copy of a plan for the building of the Auschwitz - Birkenau concentration camp , with the signature of the head of the SS , Heinrich Himmler . ""
Are these plans a lie too ? "" he asked .
Netanyahu was speaking from the same podium where the night before Ahmadinejad accused Israel of racism and barbarism in its treatment of the Palestinians .
The Israeli prime minister saluted countries such as the US , Britain , France and Canada that had either boycotted Ahmadinejad 's speech or walked out during it , and denounced those who had stayed . ""
Have you no shame ?
Have you no decency ? "" he shouted .
"" What a disgrace .
What a mockery of the UN charter .
"" Netanyahu is pressing the UN to adopt tougher sanctions against Iran and has hinted that Israel might yet launch an air strike against Iranian nuclear facilities .
He described the Iranian leadership as primitive .
The Iranian regime "" is motivated by fanaticism "" .
They want to see us go back to medieval times . ""
He added : "" The struggle against Iran pits civilisation against barbarism . """
2009-09-25,"World leaders have issued another round of accusations against Iran , this time for allegedly building a secret nuclear plant inside a mountain near the holy city of Qom .
How odd .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad did n't mention it when I and a few dozen other Americans joined him for dinner on Thursday night .
Accusations like these , especially in the wake of the recent election debacle in Iran , stoke the debate over whether world leaders should isolate Ahmadinejad or seek to engage him .
For journalists – I was seated a few seats away from ABC News ' George Stephanopoulos –
it 's an easier call .
I have sipped plum brandy with the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadjic , chatted with dictators like Nicaragua 's Anastasio Somoza and interviewed death squad leaders in Guatemala and El Salvador .
It 's all in a day 's work .
At our dinner , there were a few references to Ahmadinejad 's loony no - Holocaust theory – one guest asked : "" In what ways do the comments you make show respect for the Jewish people ? ""
But the focus was on the more urgent question : How can the United States and Iran escape from the cycle of confrontation in which they have been trapped for years ?
I arrived for our dinner , held at a New York hotel , by walking past a crowd of angry protesters .
Later I was told that they had noticed Iranian security agents photographing them , an eerie throwback to the days when Mohammad Reza Shah 's secret police did the same .
Inside , I joined other guests milling in the lobby while the secret service conducted a last security sweep inside .
Once we were seated , Ahmadinejad appeared , recited a few Qur'an verses in Arabic , thanked us for coming , and said he would take a question from each of us .
There were 44 – he counted – and as we ate , he gave a long set of answers .
The evening left me with two main impressions .
The first is that any negotiations between Iran and the US will be difficult not only politically but culturally .
The US and its partners have specific concerns , beginning with Iran 's nuclear programme and its support for militant groups in the Middle East .
Iran is not thinking about specifics .
Instead it seeks something more diffuse : respect , dignity , treatment as an equal member of the world community .
This is a country that has been abused , humiliated and looted by foreign powers for 200 years .
As Ahmadinejad repeatedly made clear , this has left deep scars .
"" We see the world differently from the way prominent politicians in the US see it , "" he said at one point .
Later he complained about big powers that "" really believe they have a right to approach the world from a position of leadership , and insist that others follow them . ""
Then he said countries "" have to recognise each other 's basic rights . ""
Asked if Iran could help stabilise Afghanistan , he said it could , but only if the US would abandon its "" unilateral approach "" .
Talks between Iran and the US , within the so - called "" five plus one "" framework , are to begin soon .
Ahmadinejad called them "" an opportunity for the whole world "" , but when asked if he believed the US is truly ready for dialogue , he seemed dubious .
"" We see the same problems recurring , "" he said .
"" We have not reached the conclusion that American politicians are serious when they say they are ready . ""
My second reaction to this dinner was awe at the American diplomatic firepower that was gathered around our large rectangular table .
Seated near me were some of the most accomplished American diplomats of their generation , starting with Thomas Pickering , a former undersecretary of state who has been ambassador to six countries ( including Israel ) and was George HW Bush 's ambassador to the United Nations .
Bridging the gap between the US and Iran is a highly complex challenge .
If Obama wants to try seriously , the retired diplomats who attended this dinner could be his "" dream team "" .
The most insightful observation I heard from any of the guests came from Hillary Mann Leverett , a former diplomat who participated in US - Iran talks in 2002 that she said produced "" very positive "" prospects for co - operation on issues related to Afghanistan .
She said those talks fell apart for reasons "" that had nothing to do with Afghanistan "" , which has led her to conclude that future talks will succeed only if they address all outstanding issues dividing the countries , rather than focusing on a few specific problems .
I came away from this dinner believing that there might still be a prospect for a US - Iran breakthrough – but only if the job is given to visionary diplomats like those who broke bread with Ahmadinejad in New York ."
2009-09-28,"In the uproar following last week 's exposure of a clandestine underground nuclear plant near Qom , little has been heard from Iran 's domestic opposition leaders and their supporters .
But Tehran 's brusque rejection of "" ludicrous "" western criticism conceals another tense secret : continuing regime nervousness about a loss of political support , a possible repeat of June 's street uprisings and the unpredictable impact of the "" crippling "" sanctions threatened by the US and its allies .
The idea that the Iranian "" nation "" , always a difficult concept in a country as ethnically , religiously and linguistically diverse as Iran , is wholeheartedly united behind President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's pursuit of its "" nuclear rights "" is even less persuasive than it was a few months ago .
The summer 's violently disputed presidential election has left ugly wounds unhealed .
The international spotlight has shifted elsewhere , partly because of a crackdown on reformist newspapers and websites and a de facto ban on western reporters .
But internal inquests continue all the same .
State - run radio confirmed this week that the Majlis ( parliament ) committee appointed to investigate post - election ill - treatment of hundreds of detainees would publish its findings next week .
The news coincided with a warning by Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem - Shirazi , at a meeting of clerics in Shiraz , that officials must "" act wisely "" to settle election - related disputes , the Mehr news agency reported .
"" Nobody is allowed to add fuel to the fire and divisions should be healed through negotiation , "" he said , adding that Iran already faced serious cultural and economic problems such as 40 % youth unemployment .
Several proposals for electoral and political reform are under discussion .
Mohsen Rezai , a defeated presidential candidate , suggested creating a national election committee "" so that the government is barred from involvement in election affairs "" .
The committee should also have retrospective power to "" correct flaws "" in the June poll , he said .
Even the devious Hashemi Rafsanjani , who backed Mir Hossein Mousavi against Ahmadinejad , has hinted that the assembly of experts , which he chairs and which has constitutional oversight of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , may yet take up "" current issues "" .
All of this may yet come to nothing .
But it does not fit the stereotyped image of a totalitarian dictatorship beating a subject population into silence .
In fact , this apparently irrepressible , very public domestic argument , notable even by Iran 's disputatious norms , is extremely unsettling for Khamenei , Ahmadinejad and his cronies as they struggle to hold the line in their homemade battle with the west .
Ali Larijani , a former chief nuclear negotiator , claimed Iranians were the victims of a "" new western propaganda offensive "" ahead of Thursday 's pivotal talks in Geneva .
Firing off a few missiles , as they did again today , may make the hardliners feel better .
But such defiant gestures seem to have little impact on a national mood that appears broodingly uncertain , defensive and self - accusatory .
Conservative newspapers such as Keyhan are stubbornly maintaining the rhetoric of confrontation .
"" What has happened so far was the first phase of the ' soft war ' adopted by Iran 's enemies ...
The night of the soft war is still young and there are more difficult days ahead ...
We have to be aware that enemies have targeted not the government but the whole system , "" it said this week .
But Jaam - e Jam , another conservative paper , was in more reflective mood . ""
In the current sensitive situation a review of the constituent foundations of the Islamic Republic is absolutely necessary , "" it said in an editorial .
Hemayat warned against a possible "" confrontation between the people and revolutionary politicians "" .
The reformist paper Arman meanwhile urged the government to heed the advice of "" prominent figures "" ( a likely reference to former president Mohammad Khatami ) on returning "" peace and calm to society "" .
On the nuclear dispute , Arman warned its readers that even the US president , Barack Obama , was now talking about military options .
"" Iran 's main objective in its foreign policy should focus on the prevention of the issuance of another [ UN sanctions ] resolution against the country , "" it said .
"" Iran should do its best to take its dossier back to the International Atomic Energy Agency "" – and by co - operating fully there , avoid additional punishment by the UN security council .
While none of this political and media ferment amounts to domestic insurrection , the fact that it is continuing despite the harsh post - election crackdown is significant .
So , too , is the defiance exhibited by tens of thousands of protesters who returned to the streets of Tehran and other major cities on 18 September , after an enforced break of two months , to express their contempt for the regime .
The hardliners won the first post - election round .
But as a weakened Ahmadinejad prepares for the next bout of political fisticuffs with the west , he must increasingly watch his back ."
2009-10-05,"In June 2005 , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's meteoric rise from mayor of Tehran to president of one of the most influential countries in the Middle East took everyone by surprise .
One of the main reasons for the astonishment was that so little was known about him .
One recently published claim about his background comes from an article in the Daily Telegraph .
Entitled "" Mahmoud Ahmadinejad revealed to have Jewish past "" , it claims that his family converted to Islam after his birth .
The claim is based on a number of arguments , a key one being that his previous surname was Sabourjian which "" derives from weaver of the sabour , the name for the Jewish tallit shawl in Persia "" .
Professor David Yeroshalmi , author of The Jews of Iran in the 19th century and an expert on Iranian Jewish communities , disputes the validity of this argument .
"" There is no such meaning for the word ' sabour ' in any of the Persian Jewish dialects , nor does it mean Jewish prayer shawl in Persian .
Also , the name Sabourjian is not a well - known Jewish name , "" he stated in a recent interview .
In fact , Iranian Jews use the Hebrew word "" tzitzit "" to describe the Jewish prayer shawl .
Yeroshalmi , a scholar at Tel Aviv University 's Center for Iranian Studies , also went on to dispute the article 's findings that the "" -jian "" ending to the name specifically showed the family had been practising Jews . ""
This ending is in no way sufficient to judge whether someone has a Jewish background .
Many Muslim surnames have the same ending , "" he stated .
Upon closer inspection , a completely different interpretation of "" Sabourjian "" emerges .
According to Robert Tait , a Guardian correspondent who travelled to Ahmadinejad 's native village in 2005 , the name "" derives from thread painter – sabor in Farsi – a once common and humble occupation in the carpet industry in Semnan province , where Aradan is situated "" .
This is confirmed by Kasra Naji , who also wrote a biography of Ahmadinejad and met his family in his native village .
Carpet weaving or colouring carpet threads are not professions associated with Jews in Iran .
According to both Naji and Tait , Ahmadinejad 's father Ahmad was in fact a religious Shia , who taught the Quran before and after Ahmadinejad 's birth and their move to Tehran .
So religious was Ahmad Sabourjian that he bought a house near a Hosseinieh , a religious club that he frequented during the holy month of Moharram to mourn the martyrdom of Imam Hossein .
Moreover , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's mother is a Seyyede .
This is a title given to women whose family are believed to be direct bloodline descendants of Prophet Muhammad .
Male members are given the title of Seyyed , and include prominent figures such as Iran 's supreme leader Ali Khamenei .
In Judaism , this is equivalent to the Cohens , who are direct descendants of Aaron , the brother of Moses .
One has to be born into a Seyyed family : the title is never given to Muslims by birth , let alone converts .
This makes it impossible for Ahmadinejad 's mother to have been a Jew .
In fact , she was so proud of her lineage that everyone in her native village of Aradan referred to her by her Islamic title , Seyyede .
The reason that Ahmadinejad 's father changed his surname has more to do with the class struggle in Iran .
When it became mandatory to adopt surnames , many people from rural areas chose names that represented their professions or that of their ancestors .
This made them easily identifiable as townfolk .
In many cases they changed their surnames upon moving to Tehran , in order to avoid snobbery and discrimination from residents of the capital .
The Sabourjians were one of many such families .
Their surname was related to carpet - making , an industry that conjures up images of sweatshops .
They changed it to Ahmadinejad in order to help them fit in .
The new name was also chosen because it means from the race of Ahmad , one of the names given to Muhammad .
According to Ahmadinejad 's relatives the new name emphasised the family 's piety and their dedication to their religion and its founder .
This is something that the president and his relatives in Tehran and Aradan have maintained to the present day .
Not because they are trying to deny their past , but because they are proud of it ."
2009-10-08,"Some very prominent reformists remain in jail after Iran 's post - election turmoil .
They include Mohammad Ali Abtahi , a senior adviser to Mehdi Karroubi , one of the defeated candidates , and Mohammad Atrianfar , a well - known journalist and confidant to the influential former president Hashemi Rafsanjani .
Wearing prison pyjamas , both men made televised mea culpas in court and "" confessed "" that claims of electoral fraud against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad were unfounded .
Abtahi 's appearance shocked observers .
Formerly chubby and ebullient , he appeared tired , drawn and to have lost several stone in weight .
Despite recent speculation that they would be released on bail , both men are believed to be still in section 209 of Tehran 's Evin prison , run by the intelligence ministry .
Also in detention is Mostafa Tajzadeh , a deputy interior minister in the reformist government of the former president Mohammad Khatami , and two prominent journalists and political commentators , Saeed Leylaz and Isa Saharkhiz , who is said to have sustained broken ribs during interrogation sessions .
Tajzadeh has appeared in court , but resisted making a confession .
So has Behzad Nabavi , a minister in Mir Hossein Mousavi 's government in the 1980s .
Student activists being held include Abdullah Momeni , a former spokesman for the student body Tahkim - e Vahdat , who confessed in court .
Momeni 's wife has claimed he was badly tortured .
The most prominent figure to be released is Saeed Hajjarian , a severely disabled ex - adviser to Khatami , who was bailed last week after recanting his political theories in court ."
2009-10-08,"The first death sentence has been passed against a defendant accused of involvement in the mass protests in Iran against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's disputed re - election , prompting fears of a wave of executions against opposition activists .
A revolutionary court in Tehran handed the penalty to Mohammad Reza Ali - Zamani , 37 , after convicting him of muhabereh – taking up arms against Iran 's Islamic system .
The sentence was imposed after he confessed to working for a little - known exile group , the Iran Monarchy Committee , which Iranian officials describe as a terrorist organisation .
Prosecutors alleged that he plotted political assassinations with US military officials in Iraq before returning to Iran "" aiming at causing disruption during and after the election "" .
Ali - Zamani admitted guilt during a series of public mass trials that began in August in which scores of senior pro - reformist politicians confessed to fomenting the unrest that followed Ahmadinejad 's victory .
Opposition leaders condemned the events as "" show trials "" and say defendants were tortured to force them to confess .
Human rights campaigners today challenged Ali - Zamani 's conviction and warned that it paved the way for further politically driven executions .
"" It 's not a good omen , "" said Hadi Ghaemi , of the International Committee for Human Rights in Iran .
"" If this is the trend of sentencing then it spells really bad news that we should expect more political executions along these lines .
That 's why this verdict has to be protested right now both inside and outside Iran . ""
More than 100 people arrested in the upheaval remain in custody , including prominent supporters of the defeated reformist candidates , Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , who insist the election was stolen .
Unlike many others in detention , Ali - Zamani is not well known .
His indictment said he had joined the Iran Monarchy Committee after hearing about it on a television satellite channel .
His activities are said to have included distributing anti - regime CDs and propaganda , as well as copies of the Satanic Verses .
Ali - Zamani was accused of meeting an American called Frank in the Iraqi city of Irbil and passing information about conditions inside Iran in exchange for money .
He was also alleged to have received instructions on how to build a chemical weapon from a fellow member of the IMC .
Another part of the indictment alleges that he met two US military officers named "" Mike and Robert "" and gave them information on Iranian officials who had allegedly been targeted for assassination .
Prosecutors claimed that Ali - Zamani – who they say had a criminal record for forging revolutionary guard and judicial stamps – took part in an operation , called Salman , in which he gave the IMC information on members of the hardline Basij volunteer militia .
They said he had conducted "" vast communication activities "" inside Iran before being arrested by intelligence officers .
The allegations were dismissed by the IMC , which is run by Iranians living in Europe and the US .
Iran has previously accused the group of being behind a bombing in a Shia religious centre in Shiraz last year that killed 15 people .
A committee spokeswoman , Dordaneh Fouladvand , confirmed that Ali - Zamani had worked with the organisation but insisted he had played no role in the post - election protests .
His activities had been limited to working for its radio station , Radio Tondar , she said .
"" We are surprised by the confession he has made in court .
He has given it under pressure and we strongly deny all he has said , "" Fouladvand said .
"" He had absolutely no links with the Americans and has n't been involved in any operations inside Iran .
His job was simply to pass on news for our radio station and to make broadcast packages . ""
Ghaemi said Ali - Zamani 's arrest may have happened before the election , raising the possibility his execution verdict had been passed to deter further protests .
"" What is significant is that the indictment makes clear that before he could engage in any action , he was arrested by the intelligence ministry , "" he said .
"" The text shows that there is no action or crime that they can tie him to . """
2009-10-09,"Britain 's troubled relations with Iran have become further strained by a row about an ancient Persian artefact described as the world 's first charter of human rights .
The British Museum is refusing to honour an agreement to lend the Cyrus cylinder to Iran because of the political turmoil that has gripped the country since the violently disputed re - election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in June .
The Iranian authorities have responded by threatening to sever links with the British Museum if it delays lending the 2,500-year - old cylinder , which was ordered by the Persian king Cyrus the Great to enshrine religious toleration .
Persian scholars claim the museum is right to be wary of lending the cylinder because of attempts by antisemitic historians in Iran to attack Cyrus 's reputation as the father of the Iranian nation .
On a visit to Tehran 's Museum of Iran this week , Hamid Baqaie , vice president of Iran 's Cultural Heritage , Handicrafts and Tourism Organisation , said : "" The British Museum implies the post - election political situation in Iran as its main excuse not to loan the cylinder to Iran 's National Museum . ""
He added : "" If the British Museum continues to make excuses for not loaning the artefact to the National Museum , we will , unfortunately , cease any co - operation with them , including archaeological expeditions and research . ""
The director of the British Museum , Neil MacGregor , agreed to lend the 23cm - long ( 9 in ) clay cylinder in return for several Iranian treasures .
Those pieces were the focus of a critically acclaimed exhibition about the era of Shah Abbas that sought to break down the perception of Iran as a hostile nation .
The cylinder was made around 530BC on the orders of Cyrus
the Great after he invaded Babylon and freed its people from tyranny .
It is known as the first charter of human rights as its cuneiform lettering decrees that everyone should be free to practise their own culture and religion .
Iran 's sizeable Jewish population trace their presence in Iran to this moment .
Hannah Boulton , head of press and public relations at British Museum , tried to play down the row . ""
When lending any material you have to check that is an appropriate moment , "" she said .
"" We are committed to lending the Cyrus cylinder to Iran .
We hope to be able to honour that commitment , we ca n't say when that will be .
At the moment we are monitoring the situation in Iran . ""
She said that Baqaie 's threat to sever relations had not been made directly to the British Museum .
"" We have very strong relationships with colleagues in Iran and we hope that these will long continue . ""
Shapour Suren - Pahlav , programme director of the London - based Circle of Ancient Iranian Studies , applauded the museum 's caution .
"" The current regime in Iran is hostile to pre - Islamic Iran , "" he said .
"" The destruction of ancient sites has increased dramatically under Ahmadinejad , so I 'm suspicious about why they want to borrow the cylinder .
I suspect they might want to destroy it ‑
they do n't like the current popularity of Cyrus .
If the cylinder was lent to Iran , who could guarantee its safety ? """
2009-10-12,"As national leaders they were sworn enemies , but when it came to buying and selling , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and George Bush were strictly business .
Official figures reveal that trade between Iran and the US rose by nearly 600 % during Ahmadinejad 's first four - year term , just as hostile rhetoric between the two countries was reaching fever pitch .
Contradicting his confrontational anti - western policies , the Iranian president oversaw a rapid increase in American imports – including a rise in the purchase of bull semen .
The pattern also confounded Bush 's depiction of Iran as a member of the "" axis of evil "" .
Ironically , trade has fallen drastically since Bush vacated the White House for Barack Obama , despite the latter 's pledge to pursue engagement with Iran .
According to the Tehran chamber of commerce , Iran bought $ 563 m ( £ 356 m ) of goods from the US last year , up from $ 98 m in the year after Ahmadinejad 's 2005 election .
The trend soared in the face of the Bush administration 's clamour for sanctions over Iran 's nuclear programme , which the US and its allies fear may be used to build a bomb .
The increase was fed by Ahmadinejad 's policy of spending spiralling oil revenues on imports , economists say .
Wheat was the most expensive item .
There was a rise in the import of US medical equipment , medicines and artificial body parts – in high demand because of the numbers of seriously disabled Iranian veterans from the 1980 - 88 war with Iraq .
Iran also bought computer equipment and US - made spare parts for its planes .
Under Ahmadinejad , Iranian traders shelled out $ 5.6 m for 735 kg of bull semen , which can be used for , among other things , medicine and cosmetics .
Since Obama took office in January , trade volumes have plummeted .
Iran bought just $ 96.2 m of US goods in the five months from the start of the Iranian year in March .
The decline indicates a tightening of the sanctions policy under the Obama administration , which has been lobbying Russia and China to support a fresh UN security council embargo after last month 's disclosure of a second Iranian uranium enrichment facility near Qom .
It also reflects a worsening of Iran 's economic position under Ahmadinejad , who has been forced to cut back on imports as falling crude oil prices have reduced oil revenues . ""
Ahmadinejad has much less room for manoeuvre with imports now , "" said Jamshid Assadi , an economist at the ESC Groupe business school in Dijon , France .
"" He was previously able to spend a great deal but now revenues are down and parliament is accusing him of overspending from the oil stability fund without approval .
At the same time , sanctions are getting much worse for Iran under Obama .
"" Obama is taking a much more severe line on sanctions and diplomacy than George Bush because he does n't want to attack Iran militarily .
If Iran does n't do what the international community asks on its nuclear programme , it will face very serious economic sanctions , perhaps leading in a year or so to a maritime blockade of the Persian Gulf . """
2009-10-13,"A leading Iranian opposition figure , Mehdi Karroubi , is facing possible trial in a court supervised by the country 's supreme leader for alleging detainees were raped after last June 's bitterly disputed election , officials confirmed today .
A special clerical court with powers to impose the death penalty was preparing a case against Karroubi after he refused to withdraw claims that male and female prisoners had been sexually abused .
Karroubi , who came fourth in the election , would be the most senior opposition figure to be tried over the turmoil that followed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's re - election .
Hardliners have repeatedly called for Karroubi and the other defeated reformist candidate , Mir Hossein Mousavi , to be arrested for insisting the poll was rigged .
More than 100 opposition figures – including Karroubi 's adviser , Mohammad Ali Abtahi – have already appeared before the revolutionary court .
But Karroubi would appear before a special court because he is a cleric , though officials have not yet confirmed that he will be tried . ""
He is a cleric and his remarks should be studied at the special court for the clergy , "" Abbas Jafari - Dolatabadi , Tehran 's chief prosecutor , told the IRNA news agency .
"" Some people have also been summoned in connection with the case . ""
The move comes after a three - man judiciary committee last month rejected the rape allegations as baseless and called for libel proceedings against anyone repeating them .
Karroubi , a former parliamentary speaker , has stood by the claims , which provoked an outcry when he first publicised them in August .
He went public with them after failing to receive a reply to his letter to the former president Hashemi Rafsanjani requesting an investigation by the experts ' assembly , a senior clerical body .
One of his witnesses has since fled to Turkey after claiming that Iranian security forces threatened to kill his family .
The proceedings suggest that Karroubi has angered Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader and Iran 's most powerful figure .
The special clerical court , established by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , is independent of the judiciary and under Khamenei 's direct control .
Unconfirmed reports previously suggested that Khamenei issued a warrant for Karroubi 's arrest after the rape allegations .
Iran 's supreme leader has sought to keep a lid on the post - election abuse controversy .
He ordered the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre in Tehran following claims that some prisoners died after being beaten and tortured .
But the publication of a parliamentary report on detainees ' treatment has been postponed twice ."
2009-10-14,"Barack Obama has reason to be proud of himself .
The Geneva meeting with Iran on 1 October produced results that exceeded the expectations of many .
First , the fact that the Iranians discussed the nuclear programme at all was an important accomplishment : Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had previously stated on several occasions that the nuclear file was closed and that it would not be part of the negotiations .
Second , Iran apparently agreed to ship some of its low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) to Russia and France for processing from 3.5 % to 20 % purity .
Obama owes this achievement to a number of developments .
One is the post - election disturbances in Iran , which damaged the regime 's image as a stable administration while reducing its legitimacy .
The other important source of leverage was information from the American , British , French and Israeli intelligence communities about the secret site in Qom .
The growing international pressure that followed the exposure of Qom eroded Iran 's negotiating position .
Meanwhile , the Iranian government also walked away with accomplishments of its own .
Many in Iran have taken the recent agreement to allow Iranian - produced LEU to be processed in Russia as western recognition of its right to enrich uranium on its soil .
This has been one of Iran 's key demands and is therefore considered a victory – as was confirmed during last Friday 's prayers in Tehran University by Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami .
Despite achievements by both sides , significant challenges remain .
According to the agreement reached in Geneva , Iran will in principle send about 80 % of its stockpile of LEU outside the country .
The latest report from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) stated that Iran possesses 1359 kg of LEU , of which about 1087 kg should be shipped abroad .
However , Iran has agreed to this only in principle .
Obama has to wait for the 19 October meeting between Iran , the IAEA , France , Russia and the US to see how much of its LEU Iran is actually willing to hand over .
Conflicting reports are now emerging from Iran .
Two days after the Geneva meeting , Peyman Jebelli , the media secretary of Iran 's Supreme National Security Council , denied that a deal had been reached over Iran 's LEU at all .
This was followed by another statement from Ali Shirzadian , spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran ( AEOI ) who said that Iran will need "" up to 660 lb ( 300 kg ) of the more enriched uranium to keep the Tehran reactor running for another 10 to 15 years "" .
This would mean that Iran would only have to give up 300 kg – 22 % , not 80 % – of its stock of LEU .
According to Dr Rasool Nafisi , a prominent Iran expert at Strayer University , "" it takes a little over two months for Iran to replace the LEU shipped to Russia - France for the exchange .
Therefore what is the breakthrough from the Geneva talks ? ""
Obama 's other possible challenge is the forthcoming National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) report .
One of the main reasons why Obama received the support of the US political establishment to negotiate with Iran in the first place is because according to the most recent NIE report , released in 2007 , Iran abandoned the military part of its nuclear programme in 2003 .
It should be noted that this finding is in direct contrast to the British intelligence services ' view that Iran is working on making a bomb .
The next NIE , which is released every two years , is due in November .
Should it reverse its previous findings and say that Iran has restarted the military part of its nuclear programme , Obama could find domestic support for his dialogue with Iran dropping drastically .
He could also find the Senate and Congress calling for immediate and much tougher sanctions .
Such a finding could also increase the credibility of US hawks , many of whom back military action .
Meanwhile , the Iranian leadership has its own set of challenges ahead .
At the 1 October meeting in Geneva , Iran was not required to stop enriching uranium on its own soil .
Furthermore , the agreement to allow it to ship its LEU to the west was not made on the condition that it would eventually have to do this .
However , Ayatollah Khamenei could soon find that the west will start pressuring him to stop uranium enrichment in Iran – either temporarily or permanently .
This is now an even more difficult decision for the Iranian leadership to take , as they have already sold their "" victory "" to the Iranian public .
To comply would mean an embarrassing U - turn .
After the recent disturbances at home , this could damage the conservatives ' position .
However , if they do n't agree to it , crippling sanctions , or even war , could follow .
After a promising start , the road ahead is full of challenges .
Success depends on trust and compromise , from both sides .
In this case , if history is anything to go by , being realistic means being pessimistic ."
2009-10-19,"Iran today blamed Pakistan as well as the US and Britain for a suicide bombing that killed six of its commanders and 37 others in one of the country 's most unstable provinces .
The head of the Revolutionary Guards , Muhammad Ali Jafari , said Iranian security officials had presented documents indicating "" direct ties "" linking a Sunni group to US , British and , "" unfortunately "" , Pakistani intelligence organisations , according to the ISNA news agency .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad strongly criticised his Pakistan counterpart , Asif Ali Zardari , in a telephone conversation .
"" The presence of terrorist elements in Pakistan is not justifiable and the Pakistani government needs to help arrest and punish the criminals as soon as possible , "" state TV quoted Ahmadinejad as telling Zardari .
Zardari telephoned Ahmadinejad to strongly condemn the suicide attack , a statement from the Pakistani president 's office .
The Sunni group , Jundallah ( Soldiers of God ) , claimed responsibility and said it was a response to "" the constant crime of the regime in Baluchistan "" .
It named the bomber as Abdol Vahed Mohammadi Saravani .
The attack , which killed the deputy commander of the guard 's ground forces , General Noor Ali Shooshtari , and Rajab Ali Mohammadzadeh , the provincial commander for Sistan - Baluchistan , inflicted Iran 's worst military casualties in years and raised questions of intelligence and security failures in a region long blighted by a violent Sunni insurgency .
Iranian media said the attacker had detonated a bomb belt as Revolutionary Guard commanders arrived for a meeting with tribal elders in a sports hall in Pishin , near Iran 's frontier with Pakistan .
It was the latest in a series of gatherings meant to foster unity in Sistan - Baluchistan , Iran 's poorest province , after a spate of attacks .
Those caught in the explosion had to be taken to hospitals more than 150 miles away because Pishin lacked proper medical facilities .
Some are understood to have died en route .
The Revolutionary Guards condemned the bombing as the work of "" terrorists "" supported by "" the great Satan America and its ally Britain "" , and promised to respond . ""
Not in the distant future we will take revenge … and Baluchis will clear this region from terrorists and criminals , "" read a statement released to the semi - official Fars news agency .
The statement echoed another call for revenge by the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , a former guard . ""
The criminals will soon get the response for their anti - human crimes , "" the official news agency IRNA quoted him as saying .
State television cited an "" informed source "" as saying that Britain was to blame "" by organising , supplying equipment and employing professional terrorists "" .
A US state department spokesman , Ian Kelly , dismissed allegations of American involvement as "" completely false "" , adding : "" We condemn this act of terrorism and mourn the loss of innocent lives . ""
Over the last five years it has become a standard Iranian position that the US - British alliance is a source of unrest in Sistan - Baluchistan and other provinces .
Officials point to the presence of Nato forces in neighbouring Afghanistan as a launchpad for Anglo - American interference .
While Iran has blamed Britain and the US for previous attacks on its territory , the latest allegation came as negotiations were due to resume in Vienna over its nuclear programme , which western governments fear may be designed to build an atomic bomb .
Iranian officials have previously linked Jundallah with al - Qaida , although other sources have suggested the group may have connections with the Pakistani Taliban .
In Tehran , the Iranian foreign minister summoned the Pakistani charge d'affaires to complain .
The attack appeared to be a direct challenge to the Revolutionary Guards , who took over direct responsibility for Sistan - Baluchistan 's security last April .
The guards have taken an increasingly prominent role in Iranian affairs in recent times under the auspices of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Jundallah has taken up arms on behalf of Sistan - Baluchistan 's Sunni Baluch population , which it says suffers discrimination at the hands of Iran 's Shia rulers .
Commanded by Abdolmalek Rigi , the group claims to have killed more than 400 Iranian troops during its insurgency .
It claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed 25 people at a Shia mosque in Zahedan , Sistan - Baluchistan 's provincial capital , last May.
The authorities responded by hanging 13 group members they said had been involved .
Sistan - Baluchistan lies on a major drug transit route from Afghanistan .
Nearly 4,000 Iranian security officers are believed to have been killed in clashes with smugglers since 1979 ."
2009-10-26,"With its stunning vistas and former Ottoman palaces , the banks of the Bosphorus – the strategic waterway that cuts Istanbul in half and divides Europe from Asia – may be the perfect place to distinguish friend from foe and establish where your country 's interests lie .
And sitting in his grandiose headquarters beside the strait , long the symbol of Turkey 's supposed role as bridge between east and west , Recep Tayyip Erdogan had little doubt about who was a friend and who was n't .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's radical president whose fiery rhetoric has made him a bête noire of the west ?
"" There is no doubt he is our friend , "" said Erdogan , Turkey 's prime minister for the last six years .
""
As a friend so far we have very good relations and have had no difficulty at all . ""
What about Nicolas Sarkozy , president of France , who has led European opposition to Turkey 's bid to join the EU and , coincidentally , adopted a belligerent tone towards Iran 's nuclear programme ?
Not a friend ? ""
Among leaders in Europe there are those who have prejudices against Turkey , like France and Germany .
Previously under Mr Chirac , we had excellent relations [ with France ] and he was very positive towards Turkey .
But during the time of Mr Sarkozy , this is not the case .
It is an unfair attitude .
The European Union is violating its own rules .
"" Being in the European Union we would be building bridges between the 1.5bn people of Muslim world to the non - Muslim world .
They have to see this .
If they ignore it , it brings weakness to the EU . ""
Friendly towards a religious theocratic Iran , covetous and increasingly resentful of a secular but maddeningly dismissive Europe : it seems the perfect summary of Turkey 's east - west dichotomy .
Erdogan 's partiality towards Ahmadinejad may surprise some in the west who see Turkey as a western - oriented democracy firmly grounded inside Nato .
It has been a member of the alliance since 1952 .
It will be less surprising to Erdogan 's secular domestic critics , who believe the prime minister 's heart lies in the east and have long suspected his Islamist - rooted Justice and Development party ( AKP ) government of plotting to transform Turkey into a religious state resembling Iran .
Erdogan vigorously denies the latter charge , but to his critics he and Ahmadinejad are birds of a feather : devout religious conservatives from humble backgrounds who court popular support by talking the language of the street .
After Ahmadinejad 's disputed presidential election in June , Erdogan and his ally , the Turkish president , Abdullah Gul , were among the first foreign leaders to make congratulatory phone calls , ignoring the mass demonstrations and concerns of western leaders over the result 's legitimacy .
Talking to the Guardian , Erdogan called the move a "" necessity of bilateral relations "" . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad was declared to be the winner , not officially , but with a large vote difference , and since he is someone we have met before , we called to congratulate him , "" he said .
"" Later it was officially declared that he was elected , he got a vote of confidence and we pay special attention to something like this .
It is a basic principle of our foreign policy . ""
The gesture will be remembered when Erdogan arrives in Tehran this week for talks with Ahmadinejad and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader , that will focus on commercial ties , including Turkey 's need for Iranian natural gas .
Ahmadinejad has voiced his admiration for Erdogan , praising Turkey 's recent decision to ban Israel from a planned Nato manoeuvre in protest at last winter 's bombardment of Gaza .
Since the election , Iran has witnessed a fierce crackdown on opposition figures that has resulted in activists , students and journalists being imprisoned and publicly tried .
Detainees have died in prison , and there have been allegations of torture and rape .
Some of those alleging mistreatment have sought refuge in Turkey .
But Erdogan said he would not raise the post - election crackdown with his hosts , saying it would represent "" interference "" in Iranian domestic affairs .
He poured cold water on western accusations that Iran is seeking a nuclear weapon , saying : "" Iran does not accept it is building a weapon .
They are working on nuclear power for the purposes of energy only . ""
Erdogan has overseen a dramatic improvement in the previously frigid relations between Turkey and Iran , which was viewed with suspicion by the pro - secularist high command of the powerful Turkish military .
Trade between the two countries last year was worth an estimated £ 5.5bn as Iran has developed into a major market for Turkish exports .
Erdogan 's views will interest US foreign policy makers , who have long seen his AKP government as a model of a pro - western "" moderate Islam "" that could be adopted in other Muslim countries .
They will also find an audience with President Barack Obama , who signalled Turkey 's strategic importance in a visit last April and has invited the prime minister to visit Washington .
They are unlikely to impress Israel , which has warned that Erdogan 's criticisms risk harming Turkey 's relations with the US .
Erdogan dismissed the notion , saying : "" I do n't think there is any possibility of that .
America 's policy in this region is not dictated by Israel . ""
He insisted that the Turkey - Israel strategic alliance – which some AKP insiders have said privately is over – remains alive but chided the Israeli foreign minister , Avigdor Lieberman , who he said had threatened to use nuclear weapons against Gaza ."
2009-10-26,"The Turkish prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , has exposed divisions in Nato by accusing the west of treating Iran unfairly over its nuclear programme and describing Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , its vehemently anti - western president , as a friend .
In a Guardian interview , Erdogan down - played western fears that Iran wants to build an atomic bomb as "" gossip "" and said a military strike against Iranian nuclear installations would be "" crazy "" .
He also strongly implied that those countries which were pressuring Iran to clarify its goals were guilty of hypocrisy because they all had nuclear weapons themselves .
"" There is a style of approach which is not very fair because those [ who accuse Iran of pursuing nuclear weapons ] have very strong nuclear infrastructures and they do n't deny that , "" Erdogan said .
"" The permanent members of the UN security council all have nuclear arsenals and then there are countries which are not members of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) which also have nuclear weapons .
So although Iran does n't have a weapon , those who say Iran should n't have them are those countries which do . ""
His comments are likely to further sour Turkey 's relations with Israel , which have nose - dived dramatically following the war in Gaza last January .
They came as Erdogan prepared this week to visit to Iran , Turkey 's neighbour , for talks with Ahmadinejad and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the Iranian supreme leader .
Erdogan 's presence will coincide with that of IAEA inspectors , who arrived in Iran yesterday to inspect a uranium enrichment facility near Qom .
Disclosure of the plant 's existence last month intensified western concerns about the about the nature of Iran 's nuclear activities .
But Erdogan indicated he accepted Iranian protestations that the programme was peaceful and said he was more concerned about threats – mainly from Israel – to "" devastate "" Iran . ""
Those who are criticising Iran do not present their arguments very well , "" he said .
"" Sometimes threats are made .
If the idea is to devastate Iran or somehow erase it altogether
I do n't think that would be right .
"" On the one hand you say you want global peace , on the other hand you are going to have such a destructive approach to a state which has 10,000 years of history .
It is not correct . ""
Asked if he considered Ahmadinejad – whom Israel accuses of threatening its destruction – a friend , he replied .
"" There is no doubt he is our friend .
We have kept very good relations and we have had no difficulty at all . ""
He defended his decision to congratulate Ahmadinejad immediately after his re - election in June despite protests that the poll was rigged and calls from the EU , which Turkey wants to join , that it be investigated ."
2009-10-28,"Dear Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , I write this message on the anniversary of your birth , which took place 53 years ago today .
You have come a long way since 1956 when your family moved from your birthplace , the sleepy village of Aradan , to Tehran .
You were only one year old at that time .
Your family , much like many others moving from small villages to the capital city in Iran , had dreams of success for their children .
They sacrificed their familiar surroundings and proximity to relatives for a new yet strange place , so that their children could have better opportunities than they did .
Your meteoric rise in politics over the last four years is undoubtedly a source of pride for your mother Seyyede Khanom , as it would have been for your late father , Ahmad Ahmadinejad .
Success , however , seems to be taking its toll on your physical appearance .
You are getting more white hair .
The nervous twitches on both your shoulders are becoming more visible and regular .
What is really interesting is that it mostly appears when you are addressing large public gatherings .
For a man who wants to be seen as confident and calm , your body seems to suggest otherwise .
And these days you seem to be hiding the dark mark on your forehead by putting your hair in front of it – the same man - made mark which fringe ultra - religious people engrave by pressing their forehead with extra strength during prayers on the prayer stone of Karbala , which all Shia Muslims have on their prayer mat .
You used to show it off before becoming president .
Many of your colleagues , such as nuclear negotiator ( and your personal friend )
Saeed Jalili still does .
Are you ashamed of it now ?
Dear Mr President , while you celebrate your special day with your family , probably eating ghorme sabzi , your favourite Iranian dish , you should look around you and see how this birthday is different from the last .
Over the last 12 months you have become one of the most scorned presidents Iran has ever had .
Just think for a moment : which other president drew so many hundreds of thousands of people to the streets to demonstrate against him ?
And which other Iranian president has damaged the economy and made the people of Iran actually poorer than you have ?
The answer is none .
This year , in one of your pre - election interviews , you said that a president has to be an expert .
He should be able to decide alone as to what is best for the country .
Mr President , you would do well to stop thinking that you are proficient in all matters .
Although you have better academic credentials than many of your predecessors , your narcissistic behaviour is driving the country into the ground .
Meanwhile with your reckless outlandish speeches , you are tarnishing the millennia - old reputation of Iranians as tolerant people .
It 's obvious that you like the camera .
One of your supporters once commented that you are the George Clooney of the Islamic world .
Cameramen also seem to love to follow you and to listen to your words .
But please note : this does not mean that what you say is necessarily correct , or constructive .
Especially when it comes to Islam .
Your presidency has led to the creation of the biggest gap between Tehran 's political circles and the clergy in Qom .
You seem to forget that the ideology behind Iran 's revolution came from the clergy , yet you have isolated them so much that grand ayatollahs such as Hossein - Ali Montazeri are questioning your version of Islam and your use of this holy religion as a tool to suppress and oppress .
Mr President , we should all learn from history .
Not long before his overthrow , the shah of Iran also believed that he knew what was best for his regime and for Iran .
He shut his ears and closed his eyes to the hundreds of thousands of screaming demonstrators who wanted change in Iranian politics .
He ignored corruption and the plight of the poor , by thinking that only he knew what was best for the economy .
Living in his cocooned world , he did not even know what the real price of a kilo of tomatoes was .
The military was his only backer .
You Mr President , are following his footsteps .
Today , Iran is a different country .
Iran 's economy , despite vast natural resources , is the pity of the Middle East .
The Iranian passport is the fourth worst passport in international leagues .
Even Lebanon , whom you supply with millions of dollars every year , requires a visa for Iranian visitors .
However , Iran has one thing that should be the envy of this world , if it already is n't .
And that is its young people .
Many of its students trounce western students in maths and science competitions .
Unfortunately , you have imprisoned many of them and killed others because they want a genuine recount of the presidential votes .
Somewhere in an Iranian classroom is sitting Iran 's future leader .
He has read in his history book how the corrupt Qajar dynasty gave up or lost huge swaths of his country and its resources to the Russians and the British .
He has listened to what his father said about the Shah , and is now watching what you are doing to his country .
However , his desire , like that of millions of young Iranians , is for something completely different : genuine democracy , where all Iranian political parties , be they monarchists , communists , People 's Mujahideen or Islamists , the same people who took to the streets 30 years ago , will have to stand for elections .
Elections where the people decide , and not the leadership .
Where Iranians are not tortured or killed for their opinion , in their own country .
That day , Mr President , could already be on its way .
The people of Iran are the country 's most powerful asset .
Ignoring and abusing them has been perilous before , and could be again .
Happy birthday ."
2009-10-29,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , today said his country was ready to co - operate with the international community over its nuclear programme but insisted it would not give up its atomic ambitions .
"" If you stretch your hand towards us honestly , we will grasp it , "" Ahmadinejad said in a nationally televised speech at a rally in the north - eastern city of Mashhad .
He said Iran was "" ready to co - operate "" on issues including the building of civil nuclear plants and fuel exchange and was prepared to work with the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , the UN 's nuclear watchdog . ""
As long as this government is in power , it will not retreat one iota on the undeniable rights of the Iranian nation , "" Ahmadinejad said .
"" Fortunately , conditions have been prepared for international co - operation in the nuclear field .
We welcome co - operation on nuclear fuel , power plants and technology , and we are ready to co - operate . ""
His comments came as Iran was expected to formally respond to a UN - drafted plan for its nuclear fuel to be processed outside the country , allowing it to be used for civil purposes but not to create nuclear weapons .
Reports in Iran suggest Tehran will accept the framework of the deal while demanding some changes .
Ahmadinejad suggested western powers were now ready to accept Iran 's nuclear programme as a reality . ""
Today we have reached a very important point , "" he said .
"" You remember where we have been a few years ago , and look where we are now . "" They imposed sanctions , made military threats and conducted psychological warfare .
But now they are seeking cooperation with the Iranian nation . ""
Today the nuclear issue is accepted as a normal issue and the [ Iranian ] people 's right .
It is nothing like before , when they wanted to impose sanctions or disable it . ""
Today they propose that we enter discussions for finding solutions about the global problems .
"" Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful , but the US and EU , among others , fear it is covertly planning to make atomic weapons .
Earlier today , IAEA inspectors returned to the organisation 's headquarters in Vienna after visiting Iran 's recently revealed second uranium enrichment plant .
The head of the delegation said the trip had been a success , but did not go into details .
The IAEA visit to the Fordo facility , carved into a mountainside south of Tehran , was the first outside inspection of the plant , the existence of which was only revealed last month .
The inspection was arranged by the IAEA 's head , Mohamed ElBaradei , who also brokered the deal under which Iran will send low - enriched uranium abroad for processing and eventual use in a research reactor .
Under the arrangement , around 70 % of the 1.5 tonnes Iran is known to possess will be sent to Russia by the end of this year for further enrichment before going to France for conversion into fuel plates .
The plates would then be returned to Tehran to power the reactor , which produces radioisotopes for cancer treatment .
Ahmadinejad indicated he was hopeful that Iran could work with the IAEA , saying : "" Fortunately , the conditions for nuclear co - operation at the international level are provided . ""
The IAEA is trying to fulfil its legal and proper role , which is nuclear co - operation and helping the independent nations in their nuclear development and technologies and to establish a healthy relations between governments . ""
He added that said he expected the six countries involved in the talks – the US , Russia , China , France , Germany and Britain – to keep their part of the bargain and "" fulfil their previous commitments "" .
Javan , a pro - government Iranian newspaper , reported today that Iran would seek to ship its uranium abroad in stages , rather than sending the bulk in one consignment .
The US and others believe the shipping of more than a tonne of the fuel would for now eliminate Iran 's opportunities to produce a nuclear weapon ."
2009-11-01,"Students across Iran are planning to lead a huge day of protest this week against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's regime , in a defiant commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the US embassy takeover by radical students in Tehran .
Thousands of green flyers and posters , drawn by anonymous artists , are circulating on the internet , inviting ordinary Iranians to join the student protests , planned for Wednesday .
Organisers have condemned the repressive measures taken by Ahmadinejad 's government since the disputed election results of the summer , which gave the Iranian president a second term and led to unprecedented demonstrations on the streets of Tehran and elsewhere .
Opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi appeared to back the protests yesterday , posting a statement on a reformist website .
Mousavi said he would press ahead with his efforts for political change .
Referring to the Iranian date of the seizing of the US embassy in 1979 , Mousavi said : "" The 13th of Aban is a ... rendezvous so we would remember anew that among us it is the people who are the leaders . ""
Iran 's police chief , Ismail Ahmadi - Moghadam , has warned demonstrators to stay off the streets , but activists predict one of the biggest days of protest since the height of the green marches .
A student of civil engineering at Amir Kabir University in Tehran , who wished to remain anonymous , said : "" The officials are very afraid of the student movement , that 's why they are preparing to crack down on 4 November .
The protests in Iran have not cooled off , they 're just beginning .
"" Iran 's students were on vacation during the failed "" Green Revolution "" of June , when hundreds of thousands of protesters attempted to overturn the official election result , which gave Ahmadinejad a crushing victory over Mousavi .
But in recent months , despite the high - profile presence on campuses of security police , universities have become centres of underground protest and organisation .
Dissent has also been expressed in schools .
One teacher in a Tehran school told the Observer that such gestures of rebellion were widespread . ""
It is amazing , "" he said , asking not to be named . ""
In the school where I 'm teaching , students show their opposition in any way that they can find , whether it 's by wearing a green wristband , green shirt , doing homework in green pen or writing slogans in toilets , on their desk or on the blackboard . ""
In an interview published on the Amir Kabir University student news website , Morteza Simiari , a leader of Iran 's Student Organisation , Tahkim Vahdat , said : "" The students who are protesting in universities today are the people who were out there in the streets in June and July and were mistreated .
Universities are part of society and what is happening now shows that people do not believe the results in the election .
"" Authorities have closed 235 schools in Kashan , in the province of Isfahan , until Saturday , ostensibly as the result of a swine flu scare , although no cases of the virus have been reported .
Since the beginning of the academic year in Iran , students in Tehran , Isfahan , Shiraz , Karaj , Qazvin and other provincial cities have all held protests against the election results .
Hundreds of students have as a result been summoned before disciplinary boards , some have been imprisoned and at least 20 expelled .
Government officials visiting universities have received stormy receptions .
On 4 October , Mohammad Javad Larijani , a close ally of Ahmadinejad , visited Sharif University , where he was confronted by students shouting "" Death to the dictator "" and chanting in favour of Mousavi .
In Tehran , the private Azad University has been a hotbed of unrest , according to students . ""
Azad university protests were huge , so they [ the authorities ] used tear gas and wielded batons to calm down the situation , "" said one of the Azad protesters .
"" They bussed in militia from other universities .
Recently 14 of us have been banned from class . """
2009-11-04,"November 4 has been a big day in Iran for the past 30 years — ever since the "" students following the imam 's line "" stormed and seized the American embassy in Tehran in one of the most memorable moments of the Islamic revolution of 1979 .
The unremarkable brick building that Tehran taxi drivers still universally identify as the "" nest of spies "" is the scene of annual mass rallies designed to highlight the regime 's enduring hostility to the United States .
But today 's ritual protests against "" global arrogance "" could turn into one of the biggest displays of opposition to the Iranian government since President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad claimed victory in last summer 's disputed elections .
Mir Hossein Mousavi , the man who says he won in June , plans to exploit the occasion to remind Iranians – and the world – that the flame of democracy has not been extinguished despite a crackdown that has seen about 70 dead , thousands of arrests , show trials , a gagged media , divisions at the top and a profound crisis about the legitimacy of the Islamic system .
November 4 , Mousavi told his supporters this week , was a "" rendezvous so we would remember anew that among us it is the people who are the leaders "" .
In response , the Revolutionary Guards have been warning Iranians to "" exercise vigilance in regard to the likelihood of mischief and plots by the enemy 's agents and some unaware and misguided people "" .
Other elements of the regime , including the powerful Guardian Council , have reinforced the message that protests are the work of malcontents linked to "" foreign oppressors "" .
This is the old insinuation that if it were not for sinister outsiders fomenting trouble , Iranians would be perfectly happy .
English - language Press - TV has warned of "" foreign media hype "" .
The scale of these warnings seems to suggest that the authorities are worried .
Mousavi and other leaders of the Green movement hope to repeat a trick they pulled off in mid - September , when their supporters succeeded in partially hijacking the annual al - Qods ( Jerusalem ) day celebrations , which expresses solidarity with the Palestinians .
The logic of these moves is that since the government will never cancel such iconic occasions in the revolutionary calendar they should be exploited to stage demonstrations .
The prospect , then , is of pro - reform protesters festooned in green chanting "" Death to dictatorship "" instead of the more familiar "" Death to America "" .
Disinformation seems to be playing a part in countermeasures undertaken by the security forces .
Reformist websites have called on people to ignore reports of protests planned outside the Russian embassy , ostensibly to protest at Moscow 's speedy recognition of Ahmadinejad 's disputed "" victory "" , and of plans by the licensed thugs of the Basij militia to storm the British embassy compound in the next street .
Iran - watchers and analysts at home and abroad say today 's "" nest of spies "" events could be a test of how hard the regime is prepared to crack down again after a period of relative calm in recent weeks
— and perhaps provide some clues about apparent disagreements between hardliners and more pragmatic elements .
Another point to watch is the coherence of the Greens ' leadership :
what is the role of Mehdi Karroubi , another defeated reformist candidate , and of Mohammed Khatami , the former president whom Ahmadinejad defeated in 2005 ?
Zahra Rahnavard , Mousavi 's popular wife , struck a defiant tone earlier this week by demanding the release of all women detainees .
Students have been organising in force across the country – an ominous reminder to the authorities of the crucial role the universities played in protests back in 1979 .
International interest in Iran 's internal situation has faded recently – not least because of the expulsion of almost all non - Iranian journalists and severe restrictions imposed on the few who remain .
But the US and other western governments will be watching carefully to see if the domestic situation has an impact on the stand - off over Iran 's nuclear ambitions – a far higher priority for them than prospects for internal change .
Following the usual script , pro - government media have been accusing Greens of trying to influence the nuclear talks , with heavy hints of treachery and links with the US .
Some have spoken out on this issue and other aspects of Iranian foreign policy .
But few have gone as far as the exiled film - maker and Mousavi spokesman , Mohsen Makhmalbaf , who has publicly apologised for the takeover of the "" nest of spies "" and even urged President Barack Obama to designate November 4 as a day of friendship between the US and Iran ."
2009-11-10,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , effectively spurned Barack Obama 's offer of renewed ties between Washington and Tehran last night by making it conditional on the US abandoning support for Israel .
He told a press conference in Istanbul that Obama had failed to deliver his promise of change in US foreign policy and said he had to choose between Israel and relations with Iran .
Ahmadinejad 's comments came hours after Tehran 's prosecutor announced spying charges against three Americans in a move that threatened to plunge US - Iranian relations to a fresh low .
The three Americans , Shane Bauer , 27 , Sarah Shourd , 31 , and Josh Fattal , 27 , have been in detention for almost two months after being arrested for allegedly entering Iran from neighbouring Iraq .
Relatives say they strayed into Iran accidentally while hiking .
The charges were condemned by Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , who renewed calls for their release .
"" We believe strongly that there is no evidence to support any charge whatsoever , "" she told reporters in Berlin .
Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi , Tehran 's chief prosecutor , said the accusations would trigger a fresh investigation , prompting fears they could be put on trial .
But Ahmadinejad suggested a less drastic outcome by voicing hope that they would not be jailed and sidestepping questions over whether he believed they were spies . ""
Unfortunately , these guys have illegally crossed our borders , "" he said .
"" We hope that they will have the appropriate response to our judiciary branch and convince the judge that they do n't have any ill intent .
We do n't like to see anybody going to jail , but after all , there are some violations and judges have the right to make a decision .
Hopefully all these problems would be resolved . ""
His remarks echoed his intervention earlier this year on behalf of another US citizen , Roxana Saberi , a freelance journalist jailed for eight years after being convicted of spying .
She was later released on appeal after Ahmadinejad called for her to be allowed to defend herself .
Speaking at the end of a summit of 57 Islamic countries , Ahmadinejad was less conciliatory on the US , a possibility raised by Obama 's offer to "" reach out a hand "" to Iran after 30 years of ruptured ties .
Asked by the Guardian what conditions the US would have fulfil for relations to be restored , Ahmadinejad said : "" Change should happen in practice .
Which change has happened ?
Was Guantánamo Bay shut down ?
Were the US policies supporting Zionists and the mass murder of Palestinians stopped ?
Were the US policies in Afghanistan changed ?
Were the policies in Iraq changed ?
"" Obama should take big decisions and changes .
He ca n't collect the support of the illegal murderous Zionist regime [ Israel ] and the countries of the region as well .
Earning friendship of the countries in the region is not compatible with the Zionist regime 's friendship .
I know that dropping the Zionist regime is a difficult choice and task .
[ But ] he should confront the Zionists and obviously the changes would not take place unless big choices happen . ""
Last night Obama said an unsettled political situation in Iran may be complicating efforts to seal a nuclear fuel deal between Tehran and major world powers .
Obama said the US , along with Russia , China , Germany , Britain and France , had made a "" fair "" offer to Iran that would allow it to have a legitimate civilian nuclear program while allaying suspicions that it was seeking to build atomic weapons .
Iran maintains its nuclear program is for purely civilian purposes ."
2009-11-23,"Protests greeted Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Brazil at the start of a South American tour intended to bolster the Iranian president 's legitimacy and ease his country 's international isolation .
Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro on the eve of Ahmadinejad 's arrival to denounce his record on human rights , homosexuality and Israel .
The Brazilian president , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , was expected to welcome the visitor with red carpet pomp in the capital , Brasilia , before holding talks on economic and political co - operation .
"" It does n't help isolating Iran , "" Lula said in his weekly radio address today .
Around 200 Iranian businessmen accompanied Ahmadinejad 's delegation , in a sign of their eagerness to tap opportunities in a continent that does not consider Tehran a pariah .
Iran 's leader faces simmering discontent at home and hostility in the west , but in Latin America he has friends and allies among a leftist bloc led by Venezuela 's Hugo Chávez and including Bolivia , Ecuador and Nicaragua .
"" This is the first time in Latin American history that an Islamic government has been so present in the US backyard , "" Hamid Molana , an Ahmadinejad adviser , told the Irna state news agency .
Achieving a first head of state invitation to Brazil was a diplomatic coup for Tehran because the region 's heavyweight had previously kept its distance .
Hobnobbing with Lula , one of the world 's most popular leaders , shows that Ahmadinejad has diplomatic cards to play even if Europe , the US and much of the Middle East are against him . ""
New orders should be established in the world , "" Ahmadinejad said before leaving Tehran .
"" Iran , Brazil and Venezuela in particular can have determining roles in designing and establishing these new orders . ""
Israel made a pre - emptive diplomatic strike last week when the president , Shimon Peres , visited Argentina and Brazil to lobby for a tough line on Iran 's suspected quest for a nuclear bomb .
On Rio 's Ipanema beach , groups representing gay people , artists , Christians , Jews , and Holocaust survivors carried protest banners and a giant cage containing white balloons as a symbol of Iran 's "" repressed values "" .
Opposition politicians criticised the visit .
"" One thing is a diplomatic relationship with dictatorships , another is to welcome their leaders in your home , "" Jose Serra , the Sao Paulo state governor , wrote in a newspaper article .
Ahmadinejad and Lula are expected to sign accords on biotechnology , energy and farming which , Tehran hopes , could boost bilateral trade from $ 2bn to $ 15bn .
They may discuss co - operation on building nuclear plants .
The Iranian president is due to address Brazil 's congress and speak to university students before heading on to Bolivia and Venezuela .
The visit will test Brazil 's ambition to be a serious diplomatic player by courting friendship with everyone .
It has urged dialogue with Iran instead of cornering the regime with sanctions . ""
If Brazil is somehow able to moderate Iran 's policies on the nuclear question , or its practice in support of terrorist groups , it would give the Lula government a tremendous boost and enhanced global stature , "" said Michael Shifter , an analyst with the Inter - American Dialogue thinktank .
"" But if Brazil does n't succeed in influencing Iran 's conduct , or is seen as indulging and legitimising such a questionable regime , then it risks alienating some in the US and Europe who expect Brazil to take a firm stand , and might even hurt its chances to get a seat on the UN security council . ""
Brazil has reportedly asked Ahmadinejad to steer clear of homophobic comments , Holocaust denial and threats against Israel .
Another delicate point will be Tehran 's crackdown on dissent after June 's presidential election .
The US has welcomed Brazil 's burgeoning diplomatic role but some members of Congress accused it of erring in "" lending legitimacy "" to Iran 's leader ."
2009-11-29,"Iran today sent a defiant signal to the international community by announcing plans to build 10 uranium enrichment plants days after it was condemned by the UN for concealing activities that are feared may be designed to produce an atomic bomb .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's government said the plants would be the same size as the main enrichment complex at Natanz , central Iran , and work would begin within two months .
"" We have a friendly approach towards the world but at the same time we wo n't let anyone harm even one iota of the Iranian nation 's rights , "" the president said .
The aim was to produce 250 - 300 tonnes of nuclear fuel a year by using centrifuges with a higher speed .
The announcement seems likely to strengthen the hands of those arguing for sanctions if negotiations do not resume soon .
The Foreign Office called the development "" a matter of serious concern "" .
The news from Tehran followed Friday 's rare display of unanimity by the security council 's "" big five "" – the US , Russia , China , Britain and France – who condemned Iran for concealing an enrichment plant in a mountainside near Qom .
The 25 - 3 vote by the International Atomic Energy Agency , the UN 's nuclear watchdog , was seen as a sign of deepening exasperation over the impasse .
Mohammed ElBaradei , the outgoing IAEA chief , warned that talks were at "" a dead end "" .
As a signatory to the nuclear non- proliferation treaty , Iran has the right to generate nuclear power for peaceful purposes , which is what is says it wants to do .
But five UN resolutions demand it suspend enrichment
and it is refusing to comply .
Nor is Iran any closer to allaying suspicions it is seeking to secretly build a nuclear weapon .
It has been asked by the IAEA to discuss evidence of warhead - related research activities but has refused .
Having been caught cheating in the past , its repeated denials have little credibility .
In recent weeks , after talks in Geneva and Vienna with the big five and Germany , Iran has seemed to reject a proposal under which most of its uranium would be shipped to France and Russia for processing into fuel for use in civilian reactors .
An arrangement of that kind would give Iran the nuclear fuel it needs but provide guarantees that it was not being diverted for military purposes .
Analysts and officials suggested the Iranian move was more about making gestures than a realistic plan .
"" This is mostly about presenting two fingers to the world , "" said one diplomat .
Others also pointed to the president 's domestic problems , where he is under pressure from conservatives in parliament , from the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and from opposition supporters protesting against the "" theft "" of last June 's election .
"" It 's bluster , "" said Sir Richard Dalton , a former British ambassador to Tehran .
"" Iran ca n't afford 10 plants the size of Natanz and 500,000 centrifuges . ""
But the move is likely to galvanise efforts to put together a package of sanctions , perhaps persuading Russia and China to back moves supported by the US , Britain and France .
Israel welcomed Friday 's censure by the IAEA but has made clear for months that it reserves the right to take pre - emptive military action if it felt that its own nuclear deterrence were to be challenged by Tehran .
The US warned on Friday that its patience is not unlimited , but doors are being left open in the hope that Iran will somehow re - engage .
Earlier today MPs announced the allocation of $ 20 m for unnamed "" progressive "" groups to combat what it called US and British "" conspiracies .
"" Iran 's parliament said the money would be disbursed by a committee including representatives of the ministries of intelligence , foreign affairs and the Revolutionary Guards ."
2009-11-29,"The Iranian government has approved the construction of 10 new uranium enrichment plants , according to state TV , in a further escalation in the diplomatic battle over the country 's nuclear capability .
The Iranian nuclear agency has been told by the government to begin work on five new sites , with locations for a further five to be found in the next two months , the report said .
The decision was reportedly made during a cabinet meeting headed by the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , this evening .
It comes shortly after Iran warned it may cut back already limited co - operation with the International Atomic Energy Agency after being censured by the UN watchdog for concealing the existence of a nuclear enrichment plant .
MPs in Tehran today called on Ahmadinejad to reconsider his policy towards the IAEA after Friday 's resolution insisting that Iran resume negotiations .
It was the first time in nearly four years that Tehran had faced censure by all five permanent members of the UN security council – their rare unanimity reflecting deepening international exasperation over the impasse in nuclear talks .
Ali Larijani , the powerful speaker of the majlis ( parliament ) , said : "" If you do not abandon the ridiculous carrot - and - stick policy , we will take a new approach towards you . ""
The parliament also announced it was allocating $ 20 m ( £ 12.1 m ) to back unnamed "" progressive "" groups to combat US and British "" conspiracies "" .
The majlis is dominated by hardliners who maintain pressure on the government to remain defiant despite talk of sanctions being imposed within weeks if nuclear negotiations do not make progress . ""
Because of world powers ' behaviour , the government should submit its plan over reducing the level of Iran 's co - operation with the agency , "" MPs said in a statement .
Parliament can oblige the government to decrease co - operation as it did in 2006 , after the Vienna - based agency voted to report Iran to the UN security council .
Western diplomats believe , however , that Iran will not burn its bridges with the IAEA for fear of alienating other countries who defend it on the grounds of its legal rights and western double standards .
Iran 's formal position is that it is seeking nuclear power for electricity generation , as it is entitled to as a signatory to the nuclear non - proliferation treaty .
But it has failed to dispel suspicions that it is seeking secretly to build a nuclear bomb .
September 's revelation of the existence of a second enrichment plant near Qom fuelled those suspicions .
The US has warned that its patience is not unlimited , but doors are being left open in the hope that Iran will somehow re - engage .
Underlining the possibility of diplomatic progress , Turkey was reported to be mediating between Iran and the IAEA over a proposal that would see Iran 's uranium processed overseas , according to al - Arabiya TV .
Turkish - Iranian relations have warmed up in recent months .
Still , there is pessimism in western capitals about the prospect for a breakthrough because of the way the nuclear issue has become enmeshed in Iran 's turbulent domestic politics .
Mehi Karroubi , one of the defeated reformist candidates in June 's disputed presidential elections , attacked Ahmadinejad at the weekend for his "" adventurist "" nuclear policy .
Karroubi and Mirhossein Mousavi , who says he beat the hardline incumbent , say they plan to keep on leading protests against the government .
Iran 's parliament said that the $ 20 m it had authorised would be disbursed by a committee including representatives of the ministries of intelligence , communications , culture and foreign affairs and the Revolutionary Guards , and would be used to target and resist US and British "" conspiracies "" .
The announcement appears to fit in with a new emphasis on using "" soft power "" to combat Iran 's western enemies , which it has repeatedly accused of seeking to foment a "" velvet revolution "" and orchestrating post - election protests in which dozens were killed in clashes with security forces and thousands detained .
The money is being drawn from Iran 's oil stabilisation fund .
Recipients were not identified but there was speculation that the funds might be earmarked for groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Palestinian Islamists of Hamas , which Iran also supports ."
2009-12-01,"British diplomats trying to secure the release of five yachtsmen detained in the Gulf will be hoping they can do business with Iran 's foreign ministry , their first and probably only port of call in terms of protocol .
But the fear must be that any decision will be made by a far more powerful part of Iran 's hydra - headed political system – the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps .
Talk of "" evil intentions "" by Esfandiar Rahim - Mashaei , chief of staff to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , was worrying enough .
But it was worse to hear the IRGC naval commander speak of "" confronting foreign forces "" in the Gulf , fuelling concerns in London that the regime may seek to exploit an apparently innocent error of navigation in its escalating confrontation with the west .
It has form in this area .
The foreign secretary David Miliband 's emphasis that this is purely a consular matter is intended to forestall an attempt by Iranian hardliners to blow the incident up .
Civilian yachtsmen are clearly a different matter from the 15 British sailors and marines whose detention by Iranian naval forces caused a tense standoff two and a half years ago .
It was clear then that key decisions were being taken by Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has direct command of the IRGC .
The same is likely to be happening now .
Relations between Iran and Britain are always turbulent , with the authorities in Tehran quick to demonise a country they blame for the overthrow of Iran 's elected prime minister in 1953 , for backing the hated shah and then seeking to undermine the Islamic revolution after 1979 .
The atmosphere has deteriorated sharply in recent months as the impasse over Iran 's nuclear programme has deepened .
Iran has repeatedly attacked the BBC 's Persian TV channel and forced the closure of the British Council offices in Tehran .
Two British diplomats were expelled and Iranian staff employed at the British embassy were arrested and accused of fomenting trouble during the unrest after June 's disputed presidential election .
Hossein Rassam , the embassy 's chief political analyst , is on bail awaiting appeal against his four - year prison sentence .
It is impossible to predict how quickly this episode will end : three Americans who crossed into Iran from Iraq in July are still detained and face spying charges .
Their families say they were hiking and strayed across the border accidentally ."
2009-12-01,"David Miliband spoke to Iran 's foreign minister this evening about the five British yachtsmen seized in the Persian Gulf last week as fears grow for their safety .
The conversation , which followed an earlier claim from Miliband that the matter would be handled at consular level , came after the Iranian ambassador to the UK went to the Foreign Office for talks this afternoon .
Rasoul Movahedian 's 30-minute meeting with the permanant undersecretary , Peter Ricketts , came after a close aide to the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , today warned the five men would face "" hard and serious "" measures if it were found they had "" evil intentions "" .
The sailors were captured six days ago when their racing yacht was intercepted by Iran 's navy while en route from Bahrain to an event in Dubai .
The incident was kept secret until yesterday as the Foreign Office sought to establish what had happened and tried to avoid raising the political temperature .
But Esfandiar Rahim - Mashaie , Ahmadinejad 's head of staff , turned up the heat . ""
Naturally , our measures will be hard and serious if we find out they had evil intentions , "" he told the semi - official Fars News agency , according to Reuters .
A Foreign Office spokesman said Ricketts had asked the ambassador for more information on the captives at their meeting this afternoon . ""
He stressed the need for Iran to confirm where the yachtsmen are being held , to grant us formal consular access to them , and the need for a speedy resolution to this matter , "" the spokesman said .
"" These were points we had been making for some days .
Since it was now almost a week since the yachtsmen were held , the delay in providing a full explanation of what had happened and clarity on Iranian intentions were a matter of increasing concern .
"" It is thought the yacht , the Kingdom of Bahrain , may have strayed inadvertently into Iranian waters , the foreign secretary , David Miliband , said .
The organisers of the race the sailors were due to compete in said the yacht had lost its propeller .
The vessel was being delivered by the crew to the annual Dubai to Muscat race , which was due to begin the following day .
All the Britons were said to be safe and well and their families have been informed .
The crew members have been named as Oliver Smith , 31 , Oliver Young , 21 , Sam Usher , Luke Porter , 21 and David Bloomer .
Miliband told the Commons today there was no connection between the capture of the crew and the diplomatic clash over Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
"" There is no link at all between the position of the yachtsmen and the Iranian nuclear file or other political issues that exist between Iran and the international community , "" he said .
"" We very much look forward to the yachtsmen being released on a consular basis . ""
The foreign secretary said the government was working with Tehran to ensure the men were released as soon as possible , adding that he understood they were being treated well , "" as we would expect in Iran "" .
Gordon Brown 's spokesman said the government was in close contact with the sailors ' families .
"" The facts are emerging .
We do n't have all the facts in front of us , "" he said .
"" What we do know is these five yachtsmen were on the way to a race .
They probably , and inadvertently , strayed into Iranian waters .
We are in close touch with the families . ""
Asked if he was certain the yachtsmen were in Iranian waters , the spokesman replied : "" The evidence appears to be that they strayed into Iranian waters . ""
Oliver Young 's father told the thisisplymouth website he was sure his son was "" fine "" .
David Young , a Plymouth businessman , said : "" He 's travelled a fair bit , he 's got quite a bit of experience under his belt .
They 'll be coping with it fine .
We understand they are being well looked after . ""
He 's been doing this since he 's 18 .
He 's with a very good friend of his and two crew members .
They 've been out there on this project for a number of weeks now …
We hope to see them very soon .
"" It 's just a worry that there are diplomatic stresses at the moment .
They are under international pressure .
We just hope they 're not used as a bargaining chip . ""
Keith Mutch , general manager of the Dubai offshore sailing club , the race organisers , told the BBC : "" In all of our sailing instructions , skippers are briefed to stay away from Iranian waters .
"" I 've been told , although I ca n't confirm this , that Team Pindar had lost her propeller .
We were waiting for her to come and pick one up . ""
The shadow foreign minister , David Lidington , called for the sailors to be released immediately .
He told the BBC : "" I think it is completely unjustifiable and I believe Iran should release these people from captivity without delay .
"" There was no justification for them being arrested in the first place . ""
The Tory MP Ben Wallace , chairman of the British - Iranian all - party parliamentary group , said Iran was trying "" make a point "" .
He told the BBC : "" A normal nation would stop a yacht , check it out , maybe take it back to shore and get rid of them .
But this is five , six days into the incident .
That is much more worrying , that is more deliberate .

2009-12-11,"The images are incongruous and unconvincing : a young man with heavy stubble looks shame - faced while forced to pose wearing Islamic chador and maghnaeh , the female headscarf .
The images were published by Iran 's state - run media in an attempt to humiliate one of the theocratic regime 's harshest critics , Majid Tavakoli , a student activist arrested last Monday in the latest demonstrations against the disputed re - election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Now the pictures have provoked an angry backlash from Ahmadinejad 's opponents who claim they display his government 's vindictiveness and contempt for women .
The semi - official Fars news agency reported that Tavakoli was arrested while trying to escape dressed as a woman after giving a speech at Tehran 's Amir Kabir University .
It posted his photo beside an image of the former Iranian president , Abolhassan Bani - Sadr , who reportedly fled the country in female disguise after falling from official favour in 1981 .
But far from discrediting Tavakoli , the move appears to have backfired by boosting his standing in the opposition movement .
A campaign on Facebook has seen more than 80 men expressing solidarity by posting pictures of themselves wearing hijabs and chadors .
Similar displays of support have surfaced on Twitter .
But the most daring mockery of the regime has appeared on a spoof website , gordab.com , which depicts faked images of Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , wearing female dress .
Tavakoli was arrested after travelling to Tehran from Bandar Abbas to attend last Monday 's student - day demonstrations , which were marked by clashes between activists and security forces .
He has spent two previous spells in jail and was among a group of students arrested and allegedly tortured in 2007 following a demonstration that disrupted a visit by Ahmadinejad to Amir Kabir University the previous year .
Human rights groups say he was beaten and tortured after his latest arrest ."
2009-12-13,"Iran 's most powerful cleric intensified the pressure on the country 's political opposition leaders today by blaming them for the "" desecration "" of a portrait of the late Ayatollah Khomeini , the Islamic revolution 's spiritual leader .
The remarks from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the supreme leader , followed days of protests , claims and counter - claims over footage on state television of an alleged anti - government protester setting fire to a picture of Khomeini .
The incident allegedly happened last Monday during protests against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's disputed re - election in June .
The two leading opposition figures , Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , vehemently denounced the act and accused the state broadcaster , IRIB , of fabricating it to discredit their supporters .
Amid a rising clamour from hardliners , Khamenei said Mousavi and Karroubi had created the conditions for such a "" grand sin "" through their "" illegal actions "" .
"" This grand desecration is the consequence of breaking the law and drawing encouragement from the foreign media , "" Khamenei told a gathering of clerics . ""
These people chant pro - Imam [ Khomeini ] slogans but do something which leads to a grand sin against him .
Instead of dismissing the whole story you have to condemn it and understand the depth and reality of the act .
Why do our former brothers , who owe their titles and names to the Islamic revolution , not understand ? ""
He also dismissed their claims that Ahmadinejad 's election victory was rigged , saying : "" The election is over .
It was legal and they could not demonstrate their claim . ""
His comments came as opposition websites voiced fears that the regime was preparing to use the incident as a pretext for a redoubled crackdown involving the arrests of Mousavi and Karroubi . ""
By implementation of a pre - planned scenario to insult Khomeini and linking it to the students ... they [ the authorities ] are paving the way for unconventional methods , "" a statement on Mousavi 's official website , Kalameh , said .
Another reformist website , Tagheer , linked to Karroubi , said : "" Based on reports ...
Mousavi may be arrested . ""
The fears appeared to be given greater credence by a statement from the revolutionary guards , which said : "" We , as followers of Imam Khomeini , will not tolerate any shortcoming in identifying , trying and punishing those behind the insult and those who carried it out . ""
On Saturday clerics loyal to Khamenei staged rallies in Tehran and other cities to voice anger at the "" insult "" while student members of the hardline basij militia today began a three - day sit - in at Tehran University . Pro -
reformist students marched off the campus in a counter - demonstration intended to show they were not responsible for burning the picture .
The controversy centred on footage showing an individual whose face was unseen ripping and setting alight pictures of Khomeini , Khamenei and Ahmadinejad .
Chants of "" death to Khamenei "" could be heard in the background .
Other footage showed a torn picture of Khomeni lying on the ground with a 10,000 rial ( £ 0.62 ) note on top .
The controversy comes amid rising tensions in the run - up to the Shia religious mourning month of Moharram , which is expected to trigger further protests when it begins on Friday .
Reformist websites reported that the authorities were establishing special "" Moharram stations "" designed to quell disturbances ."
2009-12-17,"Iran 's testing of its "" Sajjil 2 "" missile grabbed headlines in the international media .
It was described as "" an upgraded version of an advanced missile capable of hitting Israel and parts of Europe "" .
Judging by the reaction of the western press , it seems that the government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has become very adept at convincing them of its superior military capabilities .
And the fact that the Iranian government was able to do two tests of its Sajjil missiles in the space of seven months ( the previous one being in May ) is a sign that Iran is making significant advances in its missile programme .
This missile also uses solid fuel , which is more advanced than liquid fuel , used by Iran 's other missiles .
Solid fuel can also stay in the rockets for months , while liquid fuel missiles need to be fuelled right before being launched , thus making them easier to detect and destroy .
However , what the west should not forget is that Israel was already within the range of Iranian missiles before this test .
And although the solid fuel capabilities of the missile make it more difficult to detect , Israel 's new Unmanned Air Vehicles ( UAV ) , which can fly over Iran for up to 36 hours , and its sophisticated spy satellites , which have greatly improved its intelligence - gathering capabilities , should not be overlooked .
Iran is estimated to have roughly 100 - 150 missiles that can reach Israel .
Most of these are Shahab-3 missiles , which have a low accuracy rate and a payload of only 1,200 kg .
Israel has an Arrow anti - missile system which is conservatively expected to stop at least 50 % of them , if not more .
Hezbollah , which is estimated to have at least 30,000 missiles ( some have put the number at double that amount ) , could hit as far as Tel Aviv .
However , again , one should not forget the Israeli Air Force 's capabilities in this case .
During the last war in 2006 , all of Hezbollah 's long - range missiles were destroyed within a few hours .
The same could happen again , as Hezbollah 's missiles are more difficult to hide .
They are also much more within the range of Israel .
What the west should focus on is that within Iran 's perceived strength of developing new missiles lies a significant weakness .
By engaging the west in an arms race , Iran could set itself up for a battle it could lose .
Not only technically in terms of which missile has a longer range , but also politically .
Israel and the west both have larger economic stamina than Iran in keeping up in such a competition over a long period of time .
The Iranian government , whose already damaged economy is about to take a major hit through sanctions , over time will find it more and more difficult to pour resources into expensive military plans , at the expense of important social needs and projects .
However , if it does , this could have the same impact on Iran as on the former Soviet Union – economic neglect caused by mismanagement and huge defence budgets , causing the ultimate collapse of the economy and subsequently the regime .
Therefore instead of being concerned about an arms race with Iran , some western policymakers should welcome it .
This could be a powerful way to gradually bleed the Iranian leadership of what keeps it alive – economic viability .
Expensive Russian MiG fighter jets or intercontinental ballistic missiles could not hold the communist regime together for long .
The same could work in Iran , especially after the post - election upheavals there .
The more Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ignores the economic plight of his people due to excessive focus on the military , the more unpopular his regime will become .
And now that the green movement has proved its popularity by continuing with its protests for six months , the chance that public resentment could turn into viable opposition that could endanger his regime is much higher .
Engaging him in an arms race could be one way to make sure he falls into this trap .
As the old saying goes , in every cloud , there is a silver lining .
This includes the clouds of smoke emanating from Iranian missile launches ."
2009-12-18,"They are appearing in newspapers and on posters alongside major roads in Britain .
There is Barack Obama 's head , on it superimposed the image of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's leader .
The slogan reads : "" Who poses the greatest nuclear threat ? ""
For many people the answer is clear – after all , Obama has n't so far called for Israel to "" vanish from the page of time "" .
But for the Kremlin the Obama image is the latest step in an ambitious attempt to create a new post - Soviet global propaganda empire .
Two decades after the demise of Pravda , the Kremlin 's 24-hour English language TV channel , Russia Today ( RT ) , is launching its first major advertising blitz across the UK .
Dubbed North Korean TV by its detractors , the channel , available on satellite and cable TV , gives an unashamedly pro - Vladimir Putin view of the world , and says it seeks to correct the "" biased "" western view offered by the BBC and CNN . ""
What we see as black and white might not be black and white .
It 's making people question their own stereotypes , "" Margarita Simonyan , RT 's 29-year - old editor - in - chief , explains .
"" We offer an alternative to the mainstream view . ""
Certainly , RT 's advertising campaign is provocatively contrarian – casting doubt , for example , on climate change in the week of the Copenhagen summit , and comparing a British bobby to a tattooed football hooligan .
But is anyone actually going to watch it ?
"" I do n't believe in unbiased views .
Of course we take a pro - Russian position .
The BBC says it openly promotes British values , "" notes Simonyan .
Next year the Russian government will spend $ 1.4 billion ( £ 866 m ) on international propaganda – more than on fighting unemployment .
In January RT launches a Spanish service aimed at Latin America , a region of growing Kremlin geopolitical interest ; RT already broadcasts in Arabic .
The Kremlin has trebled the budgets for its main state news agencies , Ria Novosti and ITAR - Tass , despite Russia 's deep economic crisis ; there is a paid - for monthly supplement in the Daily Telegraph , Russia Now , and a revival of the Soviet - era radio station Voice of Russia .
The Kremlin employs two major PR agencies , Ketchum and GPlus , and in London uses Portland PR .
And then there are the angry bloggers – a shadowy army of Russian nationalists who are active on western newspaper websites , including the Guardian 's Comment is free site .
Anyone who dares to criticise Russia 's leaders , or point out some of the country 's deficiencies , is immediately branded a CIA spy or worse .
"" They [ the Kremlin ] are coming to realise that information matters and that control of information internationally matters even more , "" says Evgeny Morozov , a Yahoo !
fellow at Georgetown University 's institute for the study of diplomacy .
Morozov , who is writing a book on how authoritarian regimes are exploiting the internet , said the Kremlin was taking a more "" aggressive "" approach following last year 's war in Georgia .
The Russian government lost the PR battle over the conflict , at least initially , and failed to get its message across to shivering European consumers during two recent gas wars with Ukraine .
"" They have realised it is only by controlling what gets printed in the international media they can advance their hard policy agenda items , "" Morozov says .
Current Russian aims , he says , include thwarting Nato expansion and winning recognition for Moscow 's puppet states of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Morozov takes a dim view of RT – pointing out that it has a predilection for fringe guests and discredited conspiracy theorists . ""
For me it 's a comedy channel .
You watch it to see how badly mangled Russia 's attempts at influencing foreign opinion are , "" he suggests , adding that Russia has moved from Pravda to Pravda 2.0 .
Insiders at RT praise the professionalism of the staff .
It includes several British journalists and newsreaders . ""
Generally people there are pretty talented , "" one former employee said .
"" But nobody is under any illusions as to what it 's all about .
There is such a lack of objectivity .
It 's like North Korea TV . ""
RT enjoys more freedom than Russia 's domestic state - controlled channels .
But while there is sometimes broad - based criticism of the regime , there is an unspoken understanding that you can not criticise Putin , the ex - employee said .
Other sources familiar with the Kremlin 's PR strategy say that there is a lingering misunderstanding among top Russian officials as to how the western world works .
"" They think it 's enough to have good PR and that this is sufficient to act as a counterweight to the bad publicity caused by events in Russia , "" one said .
"" Obviously it is n't . ""
Asked how the Kremlin could improve its image in the west , he replied : "" They could stop beating up opposition demonstrators for a start . ""
In the long run , however , the PR strategy may pay off .
More and more newspapers are closing their bureaus in Moscow , and the number of foreign correspondents covering Russia is dwindling .
Some observers believe that over the next decade the Kremlin 's growing internet presence is likely to spill over into the western mainstream .
Simonyan insists that RT is not mere government propaganda .
Instead , she says , western reporters often have such "" strong opinions "" that they "" fail to see the truth "" about life in Russia .
"" We do n't believe we live in a country where everything is bad , "" she says , speaking from RT 's gleaming offices in central Moscow .
Wall screens broadcast RT , the BBC and CNN ; clocks show the time in Moscow , New York and London ; journalists sit in an open - plan office amid a soft hum of Russian and English .
"" We live in a country where some things are getting better and some things are getting worse , "" Simonyan suggests .
She is unrepentant about RT 's relentlessly pro - Russian coverage of last year 's Georgian war – focusing on the suffering of the South Ossetians but completely ignoring the Russian bombing of Georgian civilians .
Given the bad blood between London and Moscow , and the unresolved feud over the murder of Alexander Litvinenko , does she really think RT can find an audience in Britain ? ""
People will be surprised at how much there is in the world that they have n't been told before , "" she says ."
2009-12-21,"Hundreds of thousand of mourners , many chanting anti - government slogans , gathered in the Iranian city of Qom for the funeral today of the leading reformist cleric Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri .
Defying a heavy presence of security forces , the funeral became a rallying point for further protests against the disputed re - election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Pictures showed the defeated presidential candidates Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi among the mourners , after the opposition movement called for a national day of mourning .
There were reports of clashes after mourners chanted slogans against Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
YouTube footage showed huge crowds gathering in Qom and chants of pro - opposition slogans .
Montazeri , who died early yesterday aged 87 , was buried at the Masoumeh shrine , one of the holiest in Shia Islam .
Hundreds of thousands of people turned out , according to Reuters , citing the website Jaras .
Pictures purportedly from the event showed huge crowds , and some reports said up to a million mourners had gathered , although this was impossible to verify because of the heavy media restrictions in Iran .
The BBC said attempts were made to jam the signal on its Persian service today after the corporation began extended coverage of the funeral .
The reformist daily newspaper Parlemannews was also banned , according to the semi - official news agency Fars .
State - controlled Press TV carried only a brief report on Montazeri 's funeral , without mentioning the protest .
Mourners travelled from as far away as Isfahan and Najafabad , Montazeri 's birthplace .
Reformist websites reported that the road between Tehran and Qom was clogged with motorists heading to the funeral .
Riot police were deployed throughout Qom in preparation for a mass turnout of anti - government demonstrators , while security forces surrounded Montazeri 's house .
YouTube footage showed Montazeri 's supporters gathering at his home , where his body lay in a glass case .
The reformist website Rah - e Sabz reported that some political activists had been contacted by intelligence agents and warned that they would face arrest if they tried to attend the funeral .
Montazeri , who had long been banished from Iran 's theocratic hierarchy , had emerged as a spiritual leader for the opposition Green Movement after denouncing June 's election as fraudulent and the subsequent crackdown as un - Islamic .
Since the poll , he had been in regular contact with Mousavi and Karroubi .
Once seen as heir apparent to the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , spiritual leader of the 1979 Islamic revolution , Montazeri was sidelined and defrocked in 1988 after criticising the mass execution of political prisoners .
News of his death , attributed by his doctor to a combination of old age and chronic heart and prostate conditions , triggered fresh dissent on Iran 's university campuses , the focal point of repeated post - election clashes between students and security forces .
Noisy protests were reported at Tehran 's Sharif University and at the Science and Industry University , where students held up Montazeri 's picture and chanted : "" Today is mourning day , the green nation is the chief mourner . ""
Montazeri 's death could hardly have come at a worse time for Iran 's Islamic regime , which has sought to isolate Mousavi and Karroubi as puppets of foreign "" enemies "" .
It came just three days into the Shia mourning month of Muharram , during which the opposition had already pledged to stage a series of demonstrations .
Worse still , the seventh day of his death ‑ a special mourning occasion in Shia Islam ‑ will coincide with next Sunday 's Ashura ceremony , marking the martyrdom at Karbala of Hossein , Shia Islam 's third imam , who is regarded as a symbol of struggle against oppressive rule .
Both the government and the opposition had identified this year 's Ashura event as a potential flashpoint even before Montazeri 's death .
The ceremony has a central place in Iran 's revolutionary folklore .
Ashura demonstrations against the shah in 1978 are widely thought to have played a pivotal role in toppling the former monarch 's regime .
"" This is something the Iranian government is quite worried about , "" said Hossein Bastani , an Iranian analyst based in France .
"" On the seventh day of Ayatollah Montazeri 's death , people will be gathering to commemorate him on the same day as Ashura .
Iranian internet forums , websites and social networking sites are all talking about it .
"" This will become a nightmare for the Islamic regime .
Muharram for the Shias is the month of martyrdom and protest against cruel government , and at the moment inside Iran , many consider the Islamic republic to be the most cruel enemy of Islam and of the people . ""
The regime 's nervousness was evident from official pronouncements .
The state news agency , Irna , announced Montazeri 's death while omitting his official title of grand ayatollah , while the culture and Islamic guidance ministry told newspapers to stress his disagreements with Khomeini and ignore his political views .
Khamenei also stressed Montazeri 's differences with Khomeini . ""
At the final phase of the imam 's [ Khomeini 's ] gracious life , there had been a difficult and challenging test [ for Montazeri ] which I hope will be covered by God 's lenience , "" he said .
Montazeri spent six years under house arrest after 1997 when he criticised Khamenei as over - powerful and questioned his qualifications as a source of religious guidance .
Even after the end of his sentence , he rarely left his modest house in a quiet lane in Qom .
But his views remained sharply critical .
Interviewed by the Guardian in 2006 , he accused the regime of encouraging people to hate religion by "" misusing Islam .
From the beginning of the revolution , we have been chanting slogans of independence , liberty , Islamic republic , "" he said .
"" The complaint I have is why the slogans we have been chanting since then and are still chanting have n't been fulfilled . """
2009-12-22,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , today dismissed a year - end deadline set by the US for Iran to accept a UN - brokered deal to swap enriched uranium for nuclear fuel .
As Iran faces a renewed US drive for further sanctions , Ahmadinejad made light of the threat .
"" If Iran wanted to make a bomb , we would be brave enough to tell you , "" he told supporters in the southern city of Shiraz .
He said the west could give Iran "" as many deadlines as they want , we do n't care "" .
In an interview aired on US television yesterday , Ahmadinejad dismissed documents apparently describing Iranian efforts to make a nuclear trigger as "" fabricated and distributed by the US "" .
The president brushed away a report in last week 's Times newspaper that cited confidential Iranian technical documents detailing a four - year plan to test a neutron initiator , the part of a nuclear warhead that triggers detonation . ""
No , I do n't want to see them at all .
I do n't , "" he said .
"" They are all fabricated bunch of papers continuously being forged and disseminated by the American government , "" Ahmadinejad told ABC News .
David Axelrod , a top White House adviser , said the charge that the US had forged the documents was "" nonsense "" .
Last week , the Iranian foreign ministry called the report "" baseless ... not worthy of attention , intended to put political and psychological pressure on Iran "" .
Iran insists that its uranium enrichment programme is to generate electricity so that it can export more gas and oil , but the west suspects that Iran wants to make bombs from enriched uranium , and cites its record of nuclear secrecy .
Such suspicions were fulled in September , when Iran admitted that it had been secretly building a second uranium - enrichment facility near the holy city of Qom .
The revelation reinforced US determination to push for more sanctions against the Iranian government at a time when it is facing undiminished domestic opposition .
The US , which is pushing for a world free of nuclear weapons , has given Iran until the end of the year to respond to a United Nations plan under which Iran would ship most of its low - enriched uranium out of the country , leaving it temporarily without enough uranium stockpiles to enrich for a nuclear bomb .
In his interview with Diane Sawyer of ABC News , Ahmadinejad , who was combative and playful , declined to give a yes - or - no answer on whether he could assure the west that Iran would never make a nuclear bomb .
Instead , he shook his head and said : "" We have got a saying in Iran which says ' How many times shall I repeat the same thing ? '
You should say something only once .
We have said once that we do n't want nuclear bomb .
We do n't accept it . ""
Ahmadinejad sniped at western threats to impose further sanctions : "" They tell us ' let 's negotiate ' .
Then from the other hand , they are saying ' sanctions are coming ' .
They show the stick . ""
Respectable lady , this approach has failed ... raising the stick of sanctions and then saying let 's negotiate .
It has failed .
It 's over .
It 's not repeatable . ""
The French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , said yesterday that the UN security council had no choice but to impose new sanctions on Iran because of its refusal to co - operate on the nuclear issue .
Kouchner said he believed all of the council members would support new sanctions targeting members of Ahmadinejad 's government and its supporters .
The council is expected to take up the matter next month ."
2009-12-22,"Finding just 10 people who define the tumult of the past decade was n't exactly an easy task .
Our original list featured hundreds of names , and moved from the glamorous ( Angelina Jolie , George Clooney , Kate Moss ) , to the political ( Angela Merkel , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Benazir Bhutto ) , to the offbeat ( although his name might not be so instantly recognisable , there 's no doubt that Dr Robert Atkins changed many lives at the start of the decade with the diet he devised of meat , cheese and yet more meat ) .
The process of whittling these down was passionate and argumentative –
Simon Cowell , the Williams sisters ?
Zadie Smith , Vladimir Putin ?
–
but eventually we came up with the list we felt most summed up the themes and obsessions of the decade : David Beckham , Osama Bin Laden , Tony Blair , Carrie Bradshaw , Google , Madeleine McCann , the Obamas , Jamie Oliver , Harry Potter and Britney Spears .
Of course , we know there 's no chance of everyone agreeing on the list –
I 'll repeat , we really have had a lot of arguments over this –
but we would like to hear who your icons were , who you have loved and loathed over the past 10 years , who changed your life for the better , and who put a spanner in the works .
So , if you had to choose your icon of the decade , who would it be ?"
2009-12-31,"This week the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , blamed America and Israel for the widespread anti - government protests around Sunday 's holy mourning day of Ashura .
He insisted that "" Americans and Zionists are the sole audience of a play they have commissioned and sold out "" .
These allegations echo earlier episodes when Ahmadinejad , his ministers and loyal clerics , have insisted that Britain , Israel and the US are responsible for fomenting the mass protests that have followed June 's election - grabbing coup .
Iran has formally protested this alleged foreign interference , summoning ambassadors and crying foul .
Relations with the west – already tense over the nuclear impasse – have been further strained by arrests of foreign nationals , harassment of embassy employees and the unsavoury record of Iranian involvement in Iraq .
Just today this newspaper has published evidence showing that a British hostage captured in Iraq may in fact have been held in Iran by the Revolutionary Guard .
This revelation will worsen already deeply strained relations .
At one level Ahmadinejad 's remarks blaming the west for recent protests seem a crass political attempt to discredit the opposition and to play both on a certain Iranian tradition of xenophobia and on a widespread public memory of repeated foreign power interference historically in Iranian affairs .
At another , and more worrying , level they are clearly indicative of an irrational conspiracy theory mentality that permeates Iranian society .
An obsession with conspiracy theories is , unsurprisingly perhaps , particularly concentrated among the supporters of a regime now totally lacking legitimacy .
Iranian conspiracy theories are above all centred on the British , and an obsession with a pervasive , quasi - omnipotent British power , a siasat - e engelis , dates back at least to the start of the 20th century .
This obsession reached the very highest levels : Reza Shah , Iran 's first Pahlavi monarch , suspected his own son of working as a British agent .
In turn , when that son Muhammad Reza became shah he blamed the British for virtually every international incident , according to the diaries of Asadollah Alam , his confidant and minister of court .
Muhammad Reza was even convinced that Muhammad Mosaddeq , leader of the anti - British oil nationalisation movement , was a British employee .
Conspiracy theories persist under the republic : lift up Khomeini 's beard – so the popular joke goes – and you 'll find it stamped "" Made in England "" .
Years back , a diplomatic friend told me of a meeting in Qom with senior clerics who appealed for Jack Straw to change some aspect or other of Iranian domestic policy , seemingly convinced – despite the diplomat 's protestations – that Britain actually had this level of control over domestic Iranian affairs .
Others have told me similar stories from ambassadors and other members of Iran 's political elite , as well as from the regime 's apparatchiks more generally .
Other conspiracy theories accuse variously the Americans , European powers , Zionists , Baha'is and freemasons .
A ludicrous and nakedly antisemitic news item carried recently by Press TV ( essentially a state mouthpiece ) accused Israel of kidnapping 25,000 Ukrainian children and bringing them to the occupied territories to harvest their organs .
Another episode reinforcing this divorce from reality shared by the conspiracy theorists is the report of Iranian - Canadian journalist Maziar Bahari 's interrogation in Evin prison .
The story is harrowing indeed but especially given the preposterous insistence ( which might in other circumstances be comic ) of his interrogator that the journalist was employed simultaneously by four intelligence agencies : the CIA , MI6 , Mossad and Newsweek .
Of course there is a real and significant history of meddling and interference by foreign states in Iranian affairs .
The British legation provided refuge to thousands of anti - government figures during the constitutional revolution , and in the Anglo - Russian convention of 1907 Iran was divided into zones of influence .
Later Britain backed the coup that brought Reza Khan to power , so establishing the Pahlavi dynasty , and in 1953 worked with the CIA to mastermind the overthrow of Mosaddeq , the then prime minister , in Operation Ajax , which restored the autocracy of the shah .
There were other episodes of foreign interference : some self - serving and pernicious , others with perhaps nobler – albeit often misguided – intentions .
Popular memory and the historical narratives propagated by the republic emphasise this foreign involvement .
In so doing they deny agency to Iranian society to control its own destiny .
Take Operation Ajax .
It is certainly true that M16 and the CIA conspired against Mosaddeq .
However they were able to exploit a fear of Mosaddeq 's reforms that was growing among the conservative mercantile and clerical classes , and to work with royalists already plotting against Mosaddeq .
The opposition of several major clerics , notably Ayatollah Kashani , helped cement a wider opposition to Mosaddeq , utilised by American - paid agents provocateurs .
Had large elements of the traditionalist middle class not turned against Mosaddeq
it is unlikely that the coup would have been successful .
Conspiracy theories have been brought back to the foreground by the political crisis of recent months .
This crisis should be conceived as a dual problem of deep schisms within the ruling religio - political elite coupled with a broad mass movement challenging the election - grabbing coup of last June alongside a multitude of other grievances .
Faced with a massive legitimacy crisis , the Iranian regime and its supporters have been quick to point the finger at foreign powers .
While Whitehall and the White House were rightly initially wary of overtly supporting the Iranian opposition for fear of tainting the opposition as foreign lackeys , they were nonetheless branded as such .
Many have been arrested , tried and even convicted of espionage and of working as foreign agents .
Washington and London have now taken a more critical line : directly challenging the brutal repression and violence used against protesters and opposition figures and their families .
Mike Hammer of the White House 's national security council stated recently that America stands behind those "" who peacefully seek their universal rights "" .
Ahmadinejad 's insistence in blaming the unrest on foreign powers is not simply disingenuous ; he may well genuinely believe his assertions .
Many are convinced that a "" British establishment "" is working to overthrow Iran 's political system and that it co - ordinates organisations as varied as the BBC , the Guardian , the Palace of Westminster , the British Museum ( with its Shah Abbas exhibition supposedly intended to reinforce Sunni / Shia divides ) , and the Queen 's College at the University of Oxford ( which established a scholarship in memory of Neda Agha - Soltan ) .
Iranian society is certainly not unique in favouring conspiracy theories .
However , in Iran these ideas reach the highest level of the ruling classes with horrific consequences .
In engaging with Iran and its leadership the international community should be mindful of this conspiracy mentality .
They must be transparent and candid in their dealings with Iran .
They should be open in their opposition to Iran 's violence against peaceful protest which patently contravenes treaties including the UN international covenant on civil and political rights of which Iran is a signatory .
Above all though , the international community must insist that the Iranian people alone have the ability and legitimacy to determine their political destiny , whatever they choose it to be ."
2010-01-10,"Iranian MPs lifted a blanket of official denial on the country 's post - election upheaval today by blaming a ­senior regime insider for abuses that led to the deaths of at least three prisoners in a detention centre .
In the first publicly documented ­admission that abuses occurred in the weeks after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's disputed re - election , the majlis , Iran 's parliament , identified Saeed Mortazavi , Tehran 's former chief ­prosecutor , as the main culprit in the scandal over the Kahrizak facility .
A report read out to MPs said 147 prisoners had been held in a 70-square - metre room for four days without proper ventilation , heating and food on ­Mortazavi 's orders .
The prisoners were sent to ­Kahrizak after being arrested at a demonstration on 9 July , less than a month after ­Ahmadinejad 's victory .
The facility , which was intended only for violent criminals and drug ­traffickers , was closed on the orders of Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , after it emerged that three inmates had died , including the son of a distinguished ­government scientist .
Today 's report dismissed a claim from Mortazavi that the prisoners had died from meningitis and ­acknowledged that they had been assaulted .
The deaths were caused by "" limitation of space , poor sanitary conditions , ­inappropriate nutrition , heat , lack of ventilation and … also as a result of physical attacks "" , the report said .
It added : "" The detainees were kept for four days … in [ a 70 sq m ] room without proper ventilation , suitable food and sanitary conditions and also in very hard , ­punitive conditions . ""
Prisoners were also made to share accommodation with inmates who had been convicted of violent and drug - related crimes .
Conditions at Kahrizak became a scandal after the deaths of Mohsen Ruholamini – whose father headed Iran 's Louis Pasteur Institute – and two other prisoners , Muhammad Kamrani and Amir Javadifar .
Opposition websites reported that Khamenei acted after a pro - regime photographer , Saeed Sadaghi , told him that he had been raped in Kahrizak after being swept up in the mass arrests .
The majlis 's report "" strongly rejected "" that rape or sexual assault had taken place .
The report was commissioned by a parliamentary committee set up by the Speaker , Ali Larijani , a rival of Ahmadinejad .
Mortazavi , who is believed to have lobbied MPs not to implicate him , originally said the prisoners had died of meningitis and said inoculation kits had been sent to detention centres to stop the condition from spreading .
He also claimed Kahrizak did not fall under his jurisdiction and that he only sent detainees there because of insufficient space at Evin prison , Tehran 's main penal facility .
But the meningitis claim was dismissed by an examining doctor , Ramin Pourandarjani , who refused to certify it as the cause of death until he was arrested and forced to do so .
Pourandarjani himself died mysteriously in November after being charged with failing to properly treat the prisoners .
A postmortem said he died after eating a poisoned salad .
The report rejected Mortazavi 's ­disclaimers of responsibility and cited a letter from the office of the former ­judiciary chief , Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi , less than two years ago specifically giving him jurisdiction . ""
The denial of some judiciary ­officials of responsibility are by no means ­acceptable and – more than any other branch –
it is the judiciary which should be accountable for the shortcomings and weaknesses of this centre , "" the report said .
Mortazavi has since been moved to head Iran 's counter - smuggling agency .
But by naming and shaming him , the report is implicitly aiming a shot across the bows of Ahmadinejad , one of Mortazavi 's ­staunchest supporters .
The report raised the possibility that some officials were willing to sacrifice Mortazavi in an effort to contain further unrest .
But it made no mention of Iran 's deputy police chief , Brigadier General Ahmad Reza Radan , who is said to have supervised torture sessions at Kahrizak , which included spraying prisoners with water and beating them with electric cables .
Hossein Bastani , an Iranian political analyst , said there was no guarantee ­Mortazavi would face further punishment .
"" It does n't mean he will be sacrificed by the regime or that he will face arrest , "" Bastani said .
"" The parliament might have decided to sacrifice Mortazavi , but he has powerful supporters inside the regime and the most important of these are people like Ahmadinejad .
"" There are two shades of opinion inside the regime about how to react to further protests .
One says those like Mortazavi who commit crimes should be tried to calm the situation .
But others say that if you try some who are trying to crush the demonstrations you will make the others who are also responsible feel insecure . """
2010-02-03,"US and European officials today reacted sceptically to Iran 's offer to send uranium abroad for enrichment as a way of ending its standoff with the west .
The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , said yesterday that Iran was ready to send uranium overseas as requested by the UN .
Speaking in an interview with state television , he said Iran would have "" no problem "" giving the west its low - enriched uranium and taking it back several months later when it had been enriched by 20 % . ""
If we allow them to take it , there is no problem .
We sign a contract to give 3.5 % enriched uranium and receive 20 % enriched after four or five months , "" the president said .
He dismissed concerns voiced by what he described as "" colleagues "" that the west would not return the uranium , saying Iran would respond to that by continuing to produce its own enriched uranium .
The French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , said his interpretation of the Iranian offer was that Tehran was "" trying to buy time "" .
He told reporters in Paris he was "" perplexed and even a bit pessimistic "" .
A UN proposal , drawn up last October , envisaged Iran sending low - enriched uranium to Russia and France for further enrichment before use in a research reactor in Tehran .
The plan was intended to reduce international tensions between Iran and the countries negotiating over its nuclear programme – the US , China , Russia , Britain , France and Germany .
However , Ahmadinejad 's timeframe of four or five months appeared to fall short of the full year that western officials said it would take for Iran 's enriched fuel to be turned into rods for a reactor .
If this difference can not be bridged , it could allow Iran to claim that the deal had failed because of western foot - dragging .
Responding to Ahmadinejad 's remarks , PJ Crowley , a US state department spokesman , said : "" There is a forum to be able to resolve whether this is a serious offer , and that 's through the IAEA
[ International Atomic Energy Agency ] .
"" If Iran is serious , they can inform the IAEA that they are ready to accept the deal that 's on the table . ""
Ahmadinejad did not address whether Iran was ready to ship out most of its stockpile in one batch – another condition set by the six world powers endorsing the fuel swap .
If Iran agreed to export most of its enriched uranium in one shipment , that would delay its ability to make a nuclear weapon by depriving it of the material needed to construct the fissile core .
Experts believe Tehran would need at least 12 months to replenish its stockpile at its present rate of uranium enrichment .
The west suspects the nuclear programme is geared toward acquiring atomic weapons , but Iran has said the programme is intended only for generating energy .
In a separate development , Iran said it had successfully launched a rocket carrying a mouse , turtle and worms into space for research purposes .
The launch of the Kavoshgar-3 – which means Explorer-3 in Farsi – came after Iranian state television broadcast images of officials putting the creatures inside a capsule before the rocket took off .
The defence minister , General Ahmad Vahidi , announced the launch but did not elaborate on the rocket or its research purposes ."
2010-02-03,"European officials yesterday dismissed an apparent offer by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to relaunch negotiations over Iran 's uranium stockpile as a time - wasting gambit aimed at ducking the threat of sanctions .
They said the Iranian president 's offer to export uranium in return for fuel rods , under a deal struck last October that subsequently fell apart , would not be taken seriously unless it was presented to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
Diplomats in Vienna , where the IAEA has its headquarters , said last night the agency had not received any formal signal that Iran was ready to change its negotiating position .
Officials in Europe and Washington argued the timing of Ahmadinejad 's comments seemed aimed more at forestalling sanctions , under discussion at the UN security council , than at striking a deal .
"" My interpretation is that they 're buying time , "" the French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , said today .
"" But it 's been some years – since 2007 – that we 've been talking .
And I do n't see progress … I am perplexed and bit pessimistic . ""
"" Ahmadinejad used a Tuesday night interview on Iranian television to revive talk of a deal provisionally agreed in Geneva last year , under which up to 75 % of Iran 's low enriched uranium ( LEU ) would be shipped out , initially to Russia , and returned – about a year later – in the form of fuel rods for a research reactor in Tehran .
After heated debate on the issue in Iran , the government told the IAEA in January that the exchange of LEU for fuel rods would have to be simultaneous .
That was rejected by western negotiators , for whom the year - long time lapse was an essential part of the deal , because it would temporarily reduce Iran 's stockpile of LEU , which the west fears could be further enriched into fuel for a warhead .
Negotiations appeared to have broken down last month , but Ahmadinejad seemed to reopen bargaining in his television interview .
"" We have no problem sending our enriched uranium abroad , "" Ahmadinejad said .
Critically , he also accepted the idea that there could be a time lapse of "" four to five "" months between the export of the uranium and the return of the fuel rods .
In his interview Ahmadinejad played down the concerns of Iranian critics that the deal was a trap intended to cheat the country out of its hard - won uranium by saying that Iran could easily enrich more if necessary .
The Iranian president 's time lapse of four to five months fell well short of the year that western negotiators said it would take to further enrich Iranian uranium to the level required by the research reactor , and then manufacture the fuel rods .
Some western officials raised the hope that it could be an opening bid intended to open serious new negotiations , but most questioned the seriousness of Ahmadinejad 's the offer .
They said it was not clear whether the president was representing his own views , or a new consensus in Tehran .
He did not say whether he was ready to export the 1,200 kg of LEU agreed in Geneva in one consignment , or in several batches .
The latter would also be unacceptable to the west , again because it would not lead to a serious reduction in the Iranian stockpile .
The Russian foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , also made clear yesterday that his government was not prepared to accept significant deviations from the deal struck in Geneva .
He said Iran had failed to stick to that provisional agreement , but had put forward proposals that were "" not supported by the IAEA and which were motivated not by an interest in finding a technical solution but more by some kind of distrust "" .
He added : "" If Iran is ready to return to the original formula we will only welcome this . ""
His German counterpart , Guido Westerwelle told journalists that "" Iran has to be measured by its actions , not by what it says .
"" It is up to Iran to show an end to its refusal to negotiate . ""
Although sanctions are being discussed at the security council , serious disagreements between the US and China , for example on internet freedom and on Tibet , have diminished the prospect of any consensus in the next few weeks .
Since Russia signalled it might agree to new sanctions last September , China has emerged as the principal opponent to punitive measures among the security council 's five permanent members .
The Chinese foreign minister , Yang Jiechi , called for continued negotiations with Iran with the aim of finding a diplomatic solution .
"" We want a consensus as soon as possible , "" he said ."
2010-02-03,"Iran has launched a ­research rocket carrying a mouse , two turtles and worms into space – showing that the country can defeat the west in the battle of technology and that it will soon send its own astronauts , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad saidtoday .
Iranian state television broadcast images of officials placing the animals inside a capsule in the Kavoshgar 3 ( explorer in Farsi ) rocket before blast - off , although it did not report where or when the launch took place .
The Iranian Students News Agency said the capsule had successfully returned to Earth with its "" passengers "" .
Western powers fear the technology used by Iran 's space programme to launch satellites and research capsules could also be used to build long - range intercontinental missiles .
A US defence expert said the launch underlined the closeness of Iran 's space and military programmes .
Ahmadinejad was unveiling three new ­Iranian - built satellites and the model of a light booster rocket , named Simorgh , which is in production .
He told state television : "" With God 's help , [ Iranian ] scientists will be sent into the space and they will observe the universe from there . ""
He added : "" The scientific arena is where we could defeat the [ west 's ] domination . ""
On the same day last year –
the 30th anniversary celebrations of the 1979 Islamic revolution –
Iran launched its first domestically produced satellite .
The news agency said Iran will name 3 February Aerospace Technology Day ."
2010-02-03,"The Foreign Office said tonight it was urgently seeking information from Iran 's government after reports that a British national was among opposition supporters on trial for taking part in anti - government street protests last year .
A 24-year - old woman with dual British and Iranian nationality is one of 16 people being tried in Tehran over the most serious unrest since the disputed election in June returned Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president , reports from Iran said .
At least eight people died when ­protesters and security forces clashed on 27 December .
The Briton , not named by the court , was born in Manchester to a British mother who later converted to Islam , the semi - official Iranian Students News Agency said .
A Foreign Office spokesman said : "" We are urgently seeking clarification from the Iranian authorities .
"" Five of the 16 opposition backers , whose trial resumed today , face the capital offence of moharebeh , or waging war against God , Reuters reported .
A week ago , Iran executed the first two people convicted in connection with anti - government protests .
The British woman does not face the death penalty , says ISNA , but the charges include espionage , immoral relations with foreigners , drinking alcohol , and insulting high - ranking officials .
She was arrested three weeks ago and is alleged to have sent 40 text messages encouraging people to go to the December protests , during the Shia Muslim festival of Ashura .
Some of the charges against the woman appear to relate to an incident last week in which two men , initially identified as German diplomats , suddenly left Iran .
According to reports in Germany , they were federal police who were flown home after one had an affair with an Iranian woman , identified separately as the Iranian - British national now on trial .
The woman is accused of having gone to parties hosted by German diplomats , at which , she has reportedly acknowledged , "" Islamic standards "" were not observed .
Separately , the woman 's lawyer , named as Mohammad Sadegh Sadeghi , told the court she admitted to drinking alcohol , but only some years ago , while in England .
Iran 's authorities are rushing through trials of opposition backers seemingly as a warning to dissidents not to stage protests on 11 February , when Iran marks the 31st anniversary of the Islamic revolution .
Iran has repeatedly blamed Britain and other western nations for secret agitation within the opposition protest movement , which insists that last year 's election was rigged to favour Ahmadinejad .
Shortly after the Ashura protests , Iran 's intelligence minister , Heydar Moslehi , said several foreign nationals were arrested for "" pursuing propaganda and psychological warfare "" .
Among those tried in the first wave of judicial hearings after the anti - government protests was Hossein Rassam , chief political analyst at the UK embassy in Tehran .
He was convicted of orchestrating the mass protests– which Britain vehemently rejects – and is on bail awaiting an appeal against his four - year jail term .
While most of the thousands of opposition supporters detained during the protests have been freed , more than 80 people have been jailed for up to 15 years and five have been sentenced to death ."
2010-02-04,"The internet has long been viewed with suspicion by Iran 's Islamic regime : a drive to stifle dissent has seen online speeds slowed to a crawl , websites hacked and filtered , email accounts monitored and a special police force formed to detect internet "" crime "" .
But amid a technophobia that has intensified in the face of continuing opposition protests against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's re - election , officials have now found one cyberspace activity they approve of : e - shopping .
A state - linked technology group has established the country 's first online supermarket aimed at revolutionising the shopping experience in a country generally lacking the gleaming emporiums that can be found elsewhere .
Meydoonak.com is offering 2,500 grocery and household items at competitive prices .
The supermarket will initially cover Tehran and operate from 8 am till midnight six days a week excluding Fridays , the Islamic day of rest .
Managers believe they can woo customers with a home delivery service which is designed to liberate consumers from the chore of shopping in the city 's notoriously traffic - congested streets .
The supermarket has been launched by the Rouyesh Technical Centre , a group linked to a state - run body , Jahad - e Daneshgahi , which has promoted a host of other hi - tech developments , including animal cloning .
The embrace of e - commerce contrasts with a generally hostile official attitude to the internet among Iran 's theocratic leadership .
The Paris - based group Reporters Without Borders has included Iran among the world 's 13 worst enemies of the internet .
In recent months Iran has filtered several opposition websites as well as social networking sites such as Facebook in an intensive effort to silence the criticism that greeted Ahmadinejad 's disputed election victory last June ."
2010-02-07,"President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad today ordered Iran 's atomic energy organisation to begin enriching its uranium stockpile to a higher level , further raising fears over the country 's nuclear ambitions .
Ahmadinejad was shown on Iranian TV giving an order for the uranium , currently enriched to the level of 3.5 % , to be further refined to 20 % purity .
State media said the work would start on Tuesday .
Iran said that it needs the more concentrated fuel for a research reactor in Tehran which makes isotopes for medical uses .
However , western officials pointed out tonight that Iran does not possess the specialised technology for turning the enriched uranium into the fuel rods used in the Tehran reactor .
They are concerned that by enriching uranium to the level of 20 % , the Islamic republic would learn how to overcome many of the technical obstacles to making weapons - grade fuel .
The percentage measures of enrichment refer to concentration of the most fissile isotope , U-235 .
A weapon small enough to put on a missile would require uranium enriched to more than 90 % U-235 .
David Albright , head of the Institute for Science and International Security , said : "" This is potentially very serious , but it depends how much they intend to enrich .
"" It would be much easier to get from 20 % to 90 % enrichment than it had been to get to 20 % , he said .
It would take just six months , using only a fraction of the centrifuges Iran has at its disposal .
Last October , Iran agreed in principle to export the bulk of its uranium to have it enriched to 20 % purity and then made into fuel rods in France , at the international community 's expense .
However , the deal subsequently unravelled amid disagreements in Tehran .
Iran 's foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , said on Friday that the deal was close to being finalised .
But the new director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency , Yukiya Amano , said Mottaki had presented no new proposals at a meeting on Saturday in Munich .
In his televised remarks , Ahmadinejad blamed western countries for the impasse .
"" We had told them to come and have a swap , although we could produce the 20 % enriched fuel ourselves , "" he said , sitting alongside Ali Akbar Salehi , head of Iran 's atomic energy organisation .
"" We gave them two to three months … and now I ask Dr Salehi to start using the centrifuges for the production . ""
The US defence secretary , Robert Gates , immediately called for international solidarity to force Iran to curb its nuclear programme .
A spokeswoman for the British Foreign Office said : "" Reports that Iran is planning to enrich some of their fuel to 20 % level are clearly a matter of serious concern . """
2010-02-10,"Iranian security forces were deploying in strength in Tehran tonight to head off what opposition supporters hope will be massive street protests to challenge the regime as its celebrates tomorrow 's anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
Mir Hossein Mousavi , leader of the green movement , has called on supporters to behave peacefully during state - sponsored events including a speech by the hardline president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , which is likely to be attended by tens of thousands of government loyalists .
Green supporters are being asked to chant : "" Death to no one , long live everyone "" – a reference to the slogans of "" Death to America "" and "" Death to Israel "" that are traditional staples of Iran 's revolutionary political culture .
But with reports of another death sentence handed down to a rioter , arrests of opposition activists and large numbers of Revolutionary Guards and Basij militia arriving in Tehran from outlying areas , nervousness was mounting last night .
"" We are closely watching the activities of the sedition movement , and several people who were preparing to disrupt the 11 February rallies were arrested , "" the Fars news agency quoted the city 's police chief , Esmail Ahmadi - Moghaddam , as saying .
"" If anyone wants to disrupt this glorious ceremony , they will be confronted by people and we , too , are fully prepared . ""
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader , warned this week that the country 's enemies would get a "" punch in the mouth "" if there were new protests .
The ILNA news agency said one of nine unnamed "" rioters "" arrested after demonstrations in December had been sentenced to death and the rest to prison terms .
Last month , two young men described as terrorists were hanged after being convicted of the crime of being "" enemies of god "" .
Official plans to deal with the latest bout of internal unrest coincide with mounting international tensions after the US president , Barack Obama , accused Iran of trying to build a nuclear weapon and warned it would face new sanctions within weeks .
The regime accuses opposition supporters of serving foreign interests .
Shirin Ebadi , the Iranian Nobel Peace laureate , warned that her country faced catastrophe if repression did not end . ""
A recurrence of the recent months ' events , the continuation of repressive policies and the killing of defenceless people could bring about a catastrophe that may undermine peace and security in Iran , if not in the entire region , "" she told the UN human rights council in Geneva .
Today 's 31st anniversary of the 1979 revolution is the most important date in the official calendar .
But events will take place behind a virtual media blackout , with the few foreign journalists in Tehran operating under severe restrictions , including being ordered to report only on pro - government rallies .
Some 65 Iranian journalists are under arrest , and internet communications have been largely shut down .
Disruption has also been reported to text - messaging services used by protesters to organise demonstrations .
Loudspeakers have been mounted along the route to the capital 's Azadi ( Freedom ) square , where Ahmadinejad is to speak , to drown out opposition slogans .
Protesters were advised to use whistles .
Mousavi has not announced his plans but Mehdi Karroubi , another defeated presidential candidate , said today he would take part and urged his supporters to "" demand their legal rights with their silence "" .
Mohammed Khatami , the former reformist president , called for support for "" the common aim of defending the revolution and the people 's rights as the main possessors of the revolution "" .
The opposition claims that Mousavi , a former prime minister , was the rightful winner of June 's presidential elections and that Ahmadinejad 's victory was fraudulent .
Sporadic street protests have persisted since then , despite a crackdown in which scores have been killed and hundreds arrested .
In the most recent flare - up , eight people died in clashes between police and protesters on 27 December when opposition supporters used the annual Shia Ashura ceremonies to stage anti - government rallies .
Two opposition leaders , Mohsen Aminzadeh and Behzad Nabavi , were jailed this week .
In Geneva , a senior US official said he hoped a UN debate next week on Iran would include investigations of the arrest of opposition leaders and alleged abuses of detainees .
People in Iran have been "" gassed , arrested , beaten up and shot "" since June , John Limbert said .
"" The … international community can bear ­witness to what is going on there . """
2010-02-11,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad struck a defiant note today as Iran 's Islamic regime celebrated the anniversary of the 1979 revolution with a major security clampdown and huge official rallies that dealt a grave blow to supporters of the opposition Green movement .
The Iranian president told a crowd of hundreds of thousands in Tehran 's Azadi ( Freedom ) square that Iran was now a nuclear state , having produced its first batch of uranium enriched to a higher level than before .
The announcement will fuel fears that the country is getting closer to building a nuclear weapon in defiance of international demands , although Ahmadinejad flatly denied this .
"" When we say we do not manufacture the bomb , we mean it , and we do not believe in manufacturing a bomb .
If we wanted to manufacture a bomb , we would announce it , "" he said .
"" Iran must be free , Iran must be powerful and it must be at the forefront of technology . ""
State television reported that "" tens of millions of people "" attended rallies on the most important day in Iran 's revolutionary calendar – a claim that is impossible to verify given a near total crackdown on independent media in the country of 70 million people .
Outside Tehran opposition protests were reported to have taken place in Shiraz , Isfahan , Mashhad and Ahwaz .
But signs were that they were relatively muted .
The regime 's overall control never seemed in doubt .
Supporters of Mir Hossein Mousavi , the man who claims to have beaten Ahmadinejad in last June 's disputed presidential election , still managed to make their voices heard , with many reportedly calling for a referendum to resolve the continuing political crisis .
But demonstrations in the capital were held well away from the route of the main pro - government rally .
Mousavi was reported by opposition websites to have been present during protests while his wife , Zahra Rahnavard , was attacked by baton - wielding militia .
Mehdi Karroubi , another defeated presidential candidate , was forced to flee Tehran 's Sadeghiyeh area after being attacked by security forces .
Hossein Karroubi , his son , called the clampdown the "" most violent in the past eight months "" .
However , there were few reports of the kind of violence that erupted during the Ashura festival in late December , when eight people were killed and thousands arrested in clashes between security forces and opposition supporters .
Today heavy security , intimidation and a media blackout gave the authorities the upper hand .
Militiamen sealed off access routes and sprayed demonstrators with paint for ease of identification .
Among those arrested were the granddaughter of Ayatollah Khomeini , and the brother of the former president Mohammad Khatami .
Both were later released .
Iranian officials were quick to claim victory in the latest round of unrest , the worst the regime has seen in 31 years . ""
The massive turnout for the [ official ] rally … shocked the central command of the arrogant front , including the US , England and the Zionist regime , "" said Major General Gholam - Ali Rashid , deputy chief of Iran 's armed forces .
"" The thinktanks of the seditionists will be destroyed for good . ""
Opposition websites reported a sense of disappointment as well as fear of the consequences of confronting the security forces .
Many people had decided to leave Tehran for the holiday weekend .
Observers said there were fewer people making V - signs or wearing the green armbands or wristbands worn by Mousavi supporters than during previous protests .
"" There were 300 of us , maximum 500 .
Against 10,000 people , "" one protester told the Associated Press .
"" It means they won and we lost .
They defeated us .
They were able to gather so many people .
But this does n't mean we have been defeated for good .
It 's a defeat for now .
We need time to regroup .
""
Morteza , 23 , a student , said : "" It 's not fair .
The government has all the facilities to organise their own rallies but we 've not been given permission to hold one protest since the election .
They bus in basiji militia from other cities to Tehran and give them free food and transportation .
"" There were lots of protesters among pro - government people but they could n't chant their slogans because the whole area was surrounded by well - equipped riot police .
That 's why it 's difficult to say how many protesters were in streets today .
"" If the mood was downbeat , anger against the regime remains undiminished .
"" Iranians have not yet gained what they wanted 31 years ago , "" said Alireza , a graphic designer .
"" They are still suffering from dictatorship and now it has become worse because it is a religious dictatorship , as Mousavi said in his latest interview . ""
International attention on Iran has focused largely on the nuclear issue , with talk of a US - led diplomatic effort to impose sanctions that will force compliance .
But the EU tonight expressed its "" great concern "" that Iranians had been prevented from expressing their views . ""
The scenes of violent repression today are part of a pattern over the past few months , "" said Lady Ashton , high representative for foreign affairs .
""
Violent crackdowns on those calling for the fundamental right to freedom of expression and assembly have cost the regime the trust of its own people as well as that of the international community .
The determination shown by protesters on Iran 's streets clearly demonstrates the strength of their desire for democracy , human rights and fundamental freedoms . """
2010-02-11,"8.00am : The Iranian opposition has been gearing up for another day of protests amid mounting international concern about Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
State television has shown images of tens of thousands of people attending the official rally in Azadi square to hear a speech by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The regime seems more determined than ever to stamp out protests and news of protests , as it celebrates the 31st anniversary of the revolution .
"" Iran 's security forces have adopted all the necessary measures in preparation for the day , "" the semi - official Fars news agency announced .
There have been more arrests , reports of Basij being bused into Tehran , and it has been ominously difficult to contact people in Iran , amid continuing restrictions on the internet .
On a practical level the regime appears ready to drown out the chants of protesters by installing loud speakers along Azadi ( Freedom ) Street , the route of one of the planned protests towards Azadi Square ( just visible in the background of this picture ) .
The opposition website Rahesabz says Basij militia stayed last night in Sharif University close to Azadi Square .
The map below shows proposed routes of one of the rallies marked in green .
The area shaded in blue shows where speeches may be held .
The text asks protesters try to be at the square by 9 am ( 6.30am GMT ) .
But the official rally also appears to be taking place in Azadi Square , with Ahmadinejad due to speak there soon .
The opposition movement has been considering mounting two alternative rallies in northern Tehran if the security services block the square .
One possible location is Evin prison , where many of the protesters from previous demonstrations have been held .
The other is Jam - e - jam close to the headquarters of the state TV station .

8.05am : CNN is showing live footage of Ahmadinejad speaking in front of hundreds of thousands of his supporters in Azadi Square .
This is state TV footage , but the regime certainly appears to have succeeded in getting out its supporters in huge numbers for what is the most important day in the Iranian calendar .
Meanwhile , there are reports on opposition websites that one of the opposition leaders Mehdi Karroubi has been attacked .
His son Hossein confirmed that his father has been attacked by Basiji militia in Ashrafi Isfahani Street in Tehran .
Mohammad Reza Khatami , the brother of the former president , has been arrested , according to the opposition website Rahesabz .
In a further sign of the crackdown Iran 's telecommunications agency has announced the suspension of access to Google 's email service Gmail .
8.28am : Riot police have shot at protesters in the Ariashahr area of central Tehran after people chanted slogans against the supreme leader Ayatollah Khameni , according to the opposition website Rahesabz .
The granddaughter of Ayatollah Khomeini , has been arrested according to Reuters , citing an opposition website .
She is also the sister - in - law of the reformist ex - president Khatami .
The Jaras website said Zahra Eshraqi and her husband Mohammad Reza Khatami , were detained during the rallies .
Jaras said the son of a leading opposition figure Mehdi Karroubi was also detained .
There are also reports on Twitter of clashes between protesters and riot police in the city of Isfahan , south of Tehran .
8.41am :
Opposition supporters chanting "" death to the dictator "" have just been heard by my Farsi - speaking colleague listening to a radio broadcast of Ahmadinejad 's speech .
During the speech Ahmadinejad announced that Iran has produced its first package of highly enriched uranium .
Iran is now a "" nuclear state "" and had produced its first batch of 20 % enriched uranium , AP quoted him as saying .
8.50am :
A full impromptu translation of Ahmadinejad 's speech , complete with asides and reaction from the crowd has been posted on Twitlonger .
8.57am :
The security forces are preventing the people from reaching Enghelab and 7 Tir Squares and clashes have been reported around Baharestan Square , according to an impressive new live blog in English and Farsi by astreetjournalist.com .
Live blogger homylaftayette has published a map showing the routes of the official rallies .
9.17am :
The first videos of the protests have been uploaded to YouTube ( credit again to YouTube user onlymehdi who has been consistently fast in uploading such footage ) .
This video shows people chanting "" referendum , referendum "" .
The demonstration appears to be taking place in front of Sadeghieh metro station in west Tehran , near where Karroubi was planning a demonstration .
Another video shows people chanting support for Mir Hossein Mousavi .
9.25am : This video appears to show numerous buses used to drive Ahmadinejad 's supporters to the official rally .
Another shows protesters chanting "" Death to Russia "" which is seen as an ally of the Iranian government .
9.35am :
The usually reliable Twitter user
Oxfordgirl reports that protesters are now moving towards the headquarters of State TV and Evin prison in northern Tehran .
You can read an interview I did with Oxfordgirl here .
9.39am :
Video footage is emerging of people chanting anti - government slogans on the Metro .
Our translator , who shall remain nameless to protect his identity , says they are singing an old revolutionary song that is traditionally sung on 22 Bahman ( 11 February ) celebrations .
But they substituted the words "" traitor shah "" for "" traitor leader "" .
And this video shows state - run TV footage of Ahmadinejad 's speech .
The broadcasters cut the sound when chants of "" death to the dictator "" became audible .
9.54am :
Human rights abuses against opposition supporters have been even more flagrant than previously thought , according to a new report .
Human Rights Watch has documented the abuses which included extra - judicial killings ; rapes and torture ; violations of the rights to freedom of assembly and expression ; and thousands of arbitrary arrests and detentions during the nine months since last June 's elections .
There is more on a Guardian project to put faces to all those killed and detained in the protests .
10.04am :
Al Jazeera 's Tehran correspondent Nazanine Moshiri says she has witnessed opposition supporters chanting against the regime .
But she said the security forces prevented them gathering at the official rally in Azadi square .
10.13am :
The first video of protests outside Tehran today has emerged on YouTube .
This appears to show demonstrators chanting protest songs in Isfahan .
And there is a report on an opposition website of a protest march in Ahwaz in the south - west of the country .
Back in Tehran , this video shows people chanting against the Basij militia .
10.29am :
There are reports of clashes in west and north Tehran , according to the opposition website Jaras .
The first video of apparent scuffles between protesters and the security forces today has also been uploaded to YouTube .
It shows people running in panic after shouting slogans against the government .
10.37am :
Here are some of the key quotes from Ahmadinejad 's speech , courtesy of AP : "" I want to announce with a loud voice here that the first package of 20 % fuel was produced and provided to the scientists . ""
"" We have the capability to enrich uranium more than 20 % or 80 % but we do n't enrich ( to this level ) because we do n't need it . ""
"" When we say we do not manufacture the bomb , we mean it , and we do not believe in manufacturing a bomb .
If we wanted to manufacture a bomb , we would announce it . ""
"" God willing , daily production ( of low enriched uranium ) will be tripled . ""
10.45am :
On yet another video protesters can be heard shouting "" Death to Khamenei "" .
So far the protests seem quite limited in scale , the protesters also appear nervous .
The video below shows perhaps the largest gathering of protesters filmed so far today , but again the crowd is relatively small compared to the demonstrations last summer .
They are calling for the release of prisoners .
10.59am :
Kalame , the opposition website closest to Mousavi , reports that opposition supporters have received threatening texts from the Iranian intelligence service telling them that today will be the last day of the unrest .
The photo on the left shows an image of the text .
Similar texts have also urged people to inform on protests by texting 113 to the security forces .
11.10am :
Here are the main points so far : •
Hundreds of thousands of people have turned up for official rallies to mark the 31st anniversary of the revolution .
•
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told a huge crowd in Tehran that Iran has produced its first batch of uranium enriched to a higher level .
•
The opposition has also taken to the streets of Tehran and other cities .
•
A massive security presence prevented protesters disrupting the main rally in Tehran , forcing them to assemble elsewhere .
•
A number of protesters have been arrested , including the granddaughter of Ayatollah Khomeini and the brother of the former president Mohammad Khatami .
Both have since been released .
11.39am :
Blogger homylafyette has been listening in to the callers to US - based ePersian Radio and translating what they say .
One caller said listen to this and held her phone up to loud chants of "" with God 's help , victory is near .
Death to this deceitful government . ""
Other callers have urged Iranians abroad to sabotage the Intelligence Ministry 's hotline for informing on protesters .
11.50am :
The scale of the crackdown is becoming clear .
The security forces were lining up next to each other in rows eight men deep along the routes of the official rally , according to a photograph published by the opposition website rahesabz .
This video also shows scores of police in riot gear .
12.02pm :
The opposition movement has been trying to organise rallies in the main square in central Tehran at 4 pm ( 12.30pm GMT ) , according to the opposition website Rahesabz .
It also reports that at least 100 protesters were arrested in the eastern city of Mashhad , and that another 20 were detained in the southern city of Shiraz in Fars province .
12.16pm :
Protesters have been filmed throwing stones and shouting abuse at the security forces in the video below .
There also appears to be the sound of gunfire .
We think the film was taken outside Evin prison in north Tehran , if you have more information please let us know ( see 8 am for contact details ) .
12.31pm :
The movements of opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi are always hard to pin down on these protest days .
The opposition website , Iran 's Green Voice , claimed he attended one of the rallies . ""
Eyewitnesses said that Mousavi appeared at the rally amongst ordinary citizens in a manner that made it difficult to tell him apart , "" it said .
It gave no further details .
There also images circulating of Rafsanjani attending the official rally .
1.04pm :
Protesters have been filmed tearing down a poster of Ayatollah Khamenei and then trampling on it .
1.11pm :
Those attending the official rally were given free food as this video shows .
One of the reasons that 22 Bahman celebrations are always well attended is because of the freebies available .
1.31pm :
There are several reports that protesters have been shot with paint pellets so that they could be identified later .
One of Karroubi 's body guards was badly injured in clashes according to an unverified account which also mentions paint guns .
1.46pm :
It 's very difficult to know exactly what has taken place today because the accounts differ so sharply .
Compare and contrast the following .
First here 's an account from a caller to Radio Farda translated by blogger homylafayette .
"" I was in Sadeghiyeh and though people were not holding up any symbols , I think most of them were against the regime because they would n't respond to the official chants from the loudspeakers .
The security forces attacked the crowd violently , with cables , batons , and gas .
Where I was , I can say that the 22 Bahman celebrations did not take place .
I saw a small gathering of regime supporters and even they were dispersed by the police .
The people were beaten and I even saw some seriously injured individuals .
That 's what happens when you 're attacked with chains .
But no shots were fired . ""
Secondly here 's state - run Press TV 's write up of today 's events
: Millions of Iranians across the country have taken to the streets to celebrate the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution .
Huge demonstrations were held all across the nation on Thursday in commemoration of the occasion .
In the capital Tehran , an extraordinarily high number of people from all walks of life marched across the city and gathered at Azadi ( Freedom ) Square to take part in the festivities .
They were carrying banners denouncing the enemies of the country .
A few hundred of supporters of Iran 's defeated presidential candidates also rallied in Tehran .
Supporters of Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi gathered in a western Tehran district .
Police stepped up security in the area to prevent possible disturbances .
Defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi was seen among the protesters .
2.04pm :
Protesters were heavily outnumbered by those at the official rally , according to AP 's Tehran correspondent .
The agency talked to some dejected opposition supporters .
"" There were 300 of us , maximum 500 .
Against 10,000 people , "" one protester said .
"" It means they won and we lost .
They defeated us .
They were able to gather so many people .
But this does n't mean we have been defeated for good .
It 's a defeat for now , today .
We need time to regroup , "" she said .
Another protester insisted the opposition had come out in significant numbers , but "" the problem was that we were not able to gather in one place because they ( security forces ) were very violent . ""
"" Maybe people got scared .
Today was not a good day . ""
AP 's sources also confirmed reports of paint ball attacks on protesters .
Riot police fired paint - filled balls at hundreds of protesters chanting opposition slogans in Sadeqieh Square , about a half - mile from the anniversary rally , witnesses said .
2.30pm :
Mousavi 's wife , Zahra Rahnavard , was attacked and prevented from attending a rally in Sadeghiye Square , according to an unconfirmed report on his Facebook page .
She was able to leave the area after being protected by supporters , it says .
2.53pm :
A half - stripped man , presumably a protester , is shown taking a savage beating by a riot policeman in this graphic new footage .
It was apparently filmed today , but as with most of these videos this is difficult to verify .
3.04pm :
Another new video purports to show a motorcycle belonging to the security forces on fire in the midst of a fairly large opposition protest .
They are chanting "" Freedom , Independence and an Iranian republic "" ( as opposed to an Islamic Republic ) .
3.26pm :
More dejection from opposition supporters , this time from NIAC , a blog representing the Iranian - American .
The post said : It 's still very early to be drawing conclusions from today 's events , as people are still out in the streets .
But one thing I 'm struck by is just how much the government has been in control today .
Sure , they chartered buses and lured tens of thousands to the official government rally with free food , but they have also managed to keep the opposition activities largely on their terms today .
The government 's strategy is to depict the protesters as a small group of rioting thugs , burning trash cans and disrupting order for their own radical , "" foreign - backed "" agenda .
Toward that end , they have been very effective at keeping the demonstrations today dispersed and nervous ...
Above all else , the ruling elites know the danger of big crowds : strength in numbers takes over and individuals no longer feel like they will be held accountable for their actions , thus their demands get more radical and their tactics more extreme ; this forces a harsher backlash from security forces , possibly including using lethal force ...
So today 's events ( like previous ones ) have seen security forces disrupt crowds before they can coalesce into a large group , arresting numerous individuals as a way of controlling the crowds before they get out of the police 's hands .
4.15pm :
That report by about Mousavi 's wife being attacked has been confirmed by his website , according to AP .
Plainclothes Basiji militiamen beat 65-year - old Zahra Rahnavard with clubs on her head and back until her supporters formed a human ring around her and whisked her away , it Kaleme as saying .
4.24pm :
This seems to be why the protests were snuffed out .
The video below shows hundreds of police and basij militia in riot gear lining the streets .
4.29pm : Tehran Bureau has published a transcript of an interview with Hossein Karroubi son of the opposition leader Mehdi Karroubi 's son .
It 's worth repeating in full :
How is your father Haj Agha Mehdi Karroubi ?
We 're treating him for burns to his face and eyes .
He 's having trouble with his lungs too .
He was badly attacked with pepper spray .
Plainclothes agents ( vigilantes ) approached him and kept spraying it in his eyes .
He 's resting at home though ; he 's not been hospitalized .
Any news of your brother Ali ?
We have n't been able to figure out where he is .
Everyone we call claims to have no information on him .
We believe he 's in the custody of the law enforcement agency .
Government officials are touting the celebrations today as a referendum on the past few months , on the Green Movement .
What do you think ?
Was this a defeat for the Green Movement ?
Well , they bussed in as many people as they possibly could from many towns and locations
-- I even saw them rounding up people myself -- and depositing them at Azadi Square , surrounded by and escorted by thousands of officers .
This is while they started beating the others ( opposition ) starting at 8 am .
Of what value is such a pro - government turnout ?
If they allowed this side ( opposition ) to gather , they would see how the masses really turn out .
For example , at Sadeghi Square , where we were , folks told us they started beating up on them since they started arriving at 8 am .
They kept gathering and they kept dispersing them .
What value was their [ the government 's ] turnout under these circumstances ?
The Iranian blogosphere appears to be disappointed by the lack of a Green presence .
Some are claiming they are no longer worthy of Mr. Karroubi ?
No , that 's not so .
This is not the case .
The people were actually very kind .
There were gatherings starting at 8 in the morning there .
They got beat up pretty bad .
When we got there , people warmly gathered around him .
But when they were violently attack -- they even pulled a dagger .
When a thug pulls a dagger and attempts to attack you with it and with knives and batons ....
No , we actually thank the people for their support .
Do you think this paves the way for the arrests of Mr. Karroubi and Mr. Mousavi ?
Until now their [ government ] actions have been irrational ; we hope they proceed in a more rational fashion from this point .
I hope such a thing does n't happen .
I hope they do n't act in such a disgraceful manner for the whole world to see .
if there are arrests , do you believe they will be followed by televised confessions of the opposition leaders ?
They 've already tried really hard to use such tactics and failed .
For all their efforts , the many arrests and all the pressure they 've put on detainees , they were only able to televise a handful of these so - called confessions .
Do you think the arrests of Mr. Karroubi 's bodyguards were premeditated ?
Mr. Karroubi received a letter from [ NAJA intelligence ] saying that Mr. Karroubi would be the target of a suicide attack and that he should n't participate in the march today .
And at the same time , they called some of our friends , his entourage in for questioning .
They got a written promise from them , agreeing they would n't take place in gatherings with Mr. Karroubi anymore .
They did everything to dissuade Mr. Karroubi from attending .
But when I saw him this morning , he was intent on going to the march .
How may Greens do you think showed up and participated today ?
I really could n't tell .
I was only in the Sadeghiyeh area , which was only one of the paths of the march .
The folks there said there were many of them there , but they [ authorities ] would beat them up and not allow them to gather .
Other areas it was the same .
I asked around and they said more or less the same thing .
They said police forces and vigilantes had a strong presence and they beat up on many people .
We 're hearing reports that Zahra Rahnavard was beat up .
Is this true ?
I do n't know .
This is the first I 've heard of it .
4.44pm :
There 's talk of more protests tonight at various squares in central Tehran and at the state TV office and Evin prison in northern Tehran .
4.47pm :
This is the first footage I 've seen today of teargas being used against protesters .
4.51pm :
That 's it for today .
Thanks for your comments .
Look out for more updates soon on our Iran page ."
2010-02-12,"The commemoration of the 31st anniversary of the Islamic revolution turned yesterday into a massive trial of strength between an ever more authoritarian and unpopular government and its ever more determined and durable opposition .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told a major rally of supporters that Iran had succeeded in enriching a first batch of uranium to a level of 20 % ( crossing a technical threshold which opens the way to weapons - grade purity ) , and thus Iran had become "" a nuclear state "" .
He was greeted with loyal chants of "" Death to Britain "" and "" Death to America "" .
Taking ever graver personal risks , opposition demonstrators were pushed underground .
There were unprecedented scenes of crowds chanting anti - government slogans in the Tehran metro as well as reports of demonstrations in Isfahan , and cities like Ahvaz that appeared for the first time on the nationwide list of trouble spots .
Which side emerged the victor ?
Consider , first , the measures the government had to take to prevent reality from intruding into its television coverage of the anniversary .
It had to hang two prisoners , issue death sentences against nine others , and warn demonstrators that if arrested they too could be charged with the capital offence of moharebeh or "" taking up arms against God "" ; it had to bus in crowds from poor rural areas , bribing them with free handouts of food ; it had to surround the route of the march with plain - clothes Basij militia ; it had to filter out Gmail and virtually shut down the internet to stop the green movement 's message from getting out .
But Iran is not China .
This government is consumed and all but paralysed by the daily chores of ensuring its own survival .
Meanwhile , a protest movement that was sparked by a disputed election and which started with slogans such as "" who stole my vote ? "" has been transformed by the passage of time into one which asks "" who stole my revolution ? "" .
One measure of this change in mood was the reaction in Tehran to the assassination last month of a leading physics professor who was killed by a remote - controlled bomb .
People automatically assumed that the regime had killed one of its own nuclear scientists .
Had this murder taken place nine months or a year ago , there would have been little hesitation in thinking that a foreign intelligence service like Mossad was involved .
There are several clocks ticking here , and the nuclear one on which western governments concentrate may not be the most important .
President Ahmadinejad plays skilfully on the uranium enrichment instrument , hinting at compromises one week and ditching them the next .
In reality , there are fewer working centrifuges this year than there were last , because the original Pakistani design is inherently faulty and machines regularly break down .
Nor is Iran closer to weaponising its enriched uranium and putting it on a missile , although the IAEA 's key questions to Iran on this issue remain unanswered .
The nuclear dispute with the west holds several political advantages for the Iranian president .
Not only does it fit easily into his narrative of Iran as a state whose ­development is being thwarted by avaricious foreign powers .
It is also a game in which he has many more cards to play .
Not so on the domestic front , where the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ran out of cards months ago .
Things have moved too far for him to regain the legitimacy he has so quickly squandered .
He now finds himself on the horns of a dilemma .
Until he compromises with opposition demands to release prisoners , the entire system is threatened .
But if he compromises , he risks a backlash from hardliners in his own camp .
President Barack Obama should take care with the sanctions he wants the UN to apply .
They could end up bolstering the very people they want to weaken .
In the end , the only clock worth listening to is the one ticking away under the supreme leader himself ."
2010-02-25,"Iran and Syria put on a show of defiant unity today , scorning US efforts to break up their alliance and warning Israel not to risk attacking either of them .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the Iranian president , flew to Damascus for talks with Bashar al - Assad days after the US appointed an ambassador to Syria after a five - year gap – a move seen by some as the start of a diplomatic thaw . ""
The Americans want to dominate the region but they feel Iran and Syria are preventing that , "" Ahmadinejad said during a press conference with Assad .
"" We tell them that instead of interfering in the region 's affairs to pack their things and leave .
If the Zionist entity wants to repeats its past errors , its death will be inevitable . ""
Assad made clear that Syria would not distance itself from Iran , its ally since the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
"" We hope that others do n't give us lessons about our region and our history , "" he said .
"" We are the ones who decide ... and we know our interests .
We thank them for their advice .
I find it strange how they talk about Middle East stability and at the same time talk about dividing two countries . ""
Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , said yesterday that the US was troubled by Syria 's relationship with Iran and characterised the appointment of an ambassador as a "" slight opening "" .
Ties between Washington and Damascus were downgraded after the murder of the former Lebanese prime minister , Rafiq al - Hariri , in 2005 was blamed on Syria .
Al - Jazeera reported that Ahmadinejad also met Khaled Mash'al , the Damascus - based leader of the Palestinian movement Hamas , and Ramadan Shallah of Islamic Jihad , both of which are supported by Tehran .
Links between Hamas and Iran have been highlighted by the killing of the Hamas official Mahmoud al - Mabhouh , by an alleged Israeli hit squad in Dubai .
Two years ago the military leader of Lebanon 's Hizbullah , Imad Mughniyeh , was assassinated in Damascus in an attack that was also blamed on Israel 's secret service , the Mossad .
It was not clear whether Ahmadinejad was also meeting Hassan Nasrallah , the Hizbullah leader .
Syria and Iran announced they were cancelling visa restrictions between their countries .
"" We must have understood Clinton wrong because of bad translation or our limited understanding , so we signed the agreement to cancel the visas , "" Assad said .
Syria was prepared for any Israeli aggression , he said .
Talks between the two countries over the Golan Heights , captured by Israel in 1967 , broke down in 2008 and show no sign of resuming .
Syria has also offered to mediate between Iran and the west over Tehran 's controversial nuclear programme but says it opposes any sanctions .
Clinton said the US wanted Syria "" generally to begin to move away from the relationship with Iran , which is so deeply troubling to the region as well as to the United States "" ."
2010-03-01,"Mohamed ElBaradei is no stranger to explosive – even nuclear – situations .
As head of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , he managed , using his legal and diplomatic expertise , to diffuse tensions over Iran 's nuclear programme between the bomb - ho George Bush in Washington and the hot - headed radical President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Tehran .
His astute diplomacy even earned him the Nobel peace prize in 2005 .
Now , having given up the helm of the IAEA , he is being propelled forward by an unexpected and spontaneous wave of popular support that is breathing new life into Egypt 's staid political landscape .
In an unprecedented contrast to the typical , top - down politics of Egypt 's ruling and mainstream opposition parties , ElBaradei has been persuaded , through grassroots activism , to come home and launch a campaign to clean up the country 's radioactive political decay after nearly three decades of toxic rule by the Hosni Mubarak regime .
His return to Egypt has felt more like a state visit by a world leader than the coming home of a senior international diplomat .
At the airport , he was treated to a hero 's welcome , with jubilant supporters cheering him on , as if he had already been elected president .
The crowd included ordinary Egyptians from across the country , as well as opposition figures , actors and novelists .
And if ElBaradei is allowed to run in the 2011 elections and manages to win – two very big "" ifs "" indeed – he will be Egypt 's first ever democratically elected leader , four presidents and almost 60 years after the 1952 revolution promised to bring democracy and freedom to Egyptians .
But for the time being , this accidental hero of Egypt 's profound desire for change is being cautiously daring .
His feet had hardly touched the ground when he was elevated by Egypt 's diverse and broad - based anti - Mubarak movement to head a coalition for political change , the establishment of which he had reportedly wanted to put off for a few months .
Its mission is to lobby the government to make the constitution more democratic and to promote social justice .
ElBaradei has even indicated his willingness to enter the presidential race but only if he can run as an independent candidate and if free and fair elections can be guaranteed .
His potential candidacy is a sad condemnation of the Egyptian regime 's unspoken policy of stifling meaningful opposition and engineering the political landscape so that Mubarak appears to be the only show in town .
In addition , ElBaradei 's meteoric rise to the upper echelons of the opposition movement is a reflection of the disarray of opposition parties and their failure to tap into popular discontent and mobilise the population to take effective action .
But how has a lawyer from a family of distinguished lawyers , who is not a career politician and who has worked outside Egypt for decades , become the face of reform in Egypt ?
Part of the reason is his international standing , which has earned him a great deal of respect and admiration at home .
More profoundly , it is a sign of the ageing Mubarak 's failing grip on power , popular frustration at the rotten state of Egyptian politics , socio - economic inequality and widespread opposition to the idea of Gamal Mubarak inheriting the presidency ( with a little behind - the - scenes help from his father ) .
This desperation is reflected in the names of grassroots opposition efforts , such as Kifaya ( Enough ) , the Egyptian Campaign against Inheritance of Power , and in the increasingly popular refrain : "" Anything but Mubarak "" .
The decision to rally around ElBaradei is born of the realisation by activists and the opposition – with the notable exception of the Muslim Brotherhood – that they lacked a charismatic figure to represent people of all classes and political stripes .
They are also gambling that ElBaradei 's international standing will protect him from the wrath of the regime and spare him the fate of the previous challenger to Mubarak 's hegemony , Ayman Nour .
So far , the regime has been doing its best to ignore the new pretender 's return and downplay the extent of Baradei Fever .
As one blogger put it : "" I 'm going to enjoy sitting back and watching how the Mubaraks deal with this wildcard . ""
But what are ElBaradei 's chances ?
Many experts are doubtful that ElBaradei will be able run as an independent candidate and time is running out for him to attach himself to a political party .
Moreover , joining a party would rob him of his unifying appeal .
Amr Hashim Rabie of the Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies believes that the best ElBaradei can hope for is to embarrass the regime at home and abroad and to galvanise popular opposition in 2011 .
But perhaps it 's too early to write off ElBaradei 's chances .
Several months ago , few would 've suspected the Nobel laureate would be in the situation he 's in today .
Besides , we should never underestimate the power of the people , even in a semi - authoritarian regime .
And therein lies ElBaradei 's most powerful weapon .
He is a popular figure in Egypt – with over 122,000 members of a Facebook group supporting him in a country where internet penetration is still fairly low .
And he understands the power of the people and the need to win their support and backing .
A reflection of this savvy is that he wasted no time in meeting the young advocates who first floated the idea of his candidacy and even recorded a Facebook message to them .
In recognition of Egypt 's youth bulge and the power of the young to change and innovate , he has also invited young people to become active members of his coalition .
Of course , even if ElBaradei becomes the next president , Egypt will not be magically transformed into a prosperous democracy .
That , as I pointed out in my vision for a democratic Egypt , will take generations of concerted effort .
Encouragingly , many of his aspirations correspond with other reform - minded Egyptians ' views – and he has indicated that he would not seek re - election if he failed to deliver results .
I would go one step further and urge him only to seek a single term in office during which he can democratise the country 's institutions and then hand over the baton to new generations of elected leaders ."
2010-03-07,"Golshifteh Farahani knows how dangerous it is now to be an artist in Tehran .
In 2008 she became the first Iranian - based actress in almost 30 years to appear in a Hollywood blockbuster .
Starring opposite Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe in Ridley Scott 's Body of Lies , she hoped the film would be appreciated in her homeland for its critical stance on America 's politics in the Middle East .
She was wrong .
When she returned to Tehran the then 24-year - old was subjected to seven months of inquisition from the authorities of the Islamic republic .
Reprimanded for not having asked the permission of the government , she became a regular guest of the Information Ministry and intelligence services .
Eventually she cracked .
By the time Body of Lies was released , she was an exile in Paris .
She does not know when she will go home .
Last week , as the Iranian diaspora reeled from the arrest of Jafar Panahi , the most outspoken film director still living in Tehran , Farahani felt a fresh rush of fury towards a regime which critics say is taking ever greater steps towards a total crackdown on free speech .
Panahi , a vocal supporter of the opposition movement and known for his award - winning , politically subversive movies , was taken from his home in Tehran on Monday night along with 16 others .
Most have since been released , but Panahi remains in detention .
He had reportedly been making a documentary on the mass protests which came in the aftermath of last year 's disputed elections .
"" We are so angry , "" says Farahani , now 26 , and a year and half into her new life as one of the French capital 's "" family "" of Iranian artistic exiles .
"" Jafar is one , maybe the only one … still in Iran who is talking .
Most artists [ in Iran ] do n't talk because they would rather work somehow .
I appreciate that , but Jafar is the one who had the courage to talk , and he talked for everyone .
""
Farahani , who is using her time in Paris to make the music she could not have made at home and to pursue her acting career , admits to feeling uncomfortable with her new role as critic - in - exile but says : "" There 's no bullet in your head .
You can talk freely . ""
She feels the changes in Iran are such that she is obliged , as one of her country 's most recognised cultural ambassadors , to speak out .
For the past month she has worn a green bracelet discreetly under her shirt sleeve – marking her out as a supporter of the green movement led by Mir Hossein Mousavi .
Yesterday she travelled to Geneva to take her place on the jury of the annual Human Rights Film Festival . ""
This time is the time that for 30 years we have been waiting for .
We 're not kids any more .
We are just asking for our rights , "" she says , speaking as a member of a generation born after the revolution of 1979 and frustrated with the hardline tendencies of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's regime .
As a musician and actress who grew up in a country convulsed by widespread violence and repression , Farahani has seen through her own eyes how Iran has become more hostile to those who dare to speak out through their creativity .
She remembers how , under the successive presidencies of Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami , rules governing music and cinema became "" relatively "" open compared with the stringent censorship that dominated the 1980s .
She remembers the first pop music that came out when she was 16 or 17 .
But she believes that , ever since Ahmadinejad came to power in 2005 , things have been very different .
"" If you want to do what you want to do , you can not work , "" she says .
"" So art is going to be finished , and this is the will of the Islamic republic : to not have any artists or art and close the doors of all the cinemas and music and everything . ""
After seeing it happen to countless friends , the lure of exile eventually seduced Farahani as well .
"" I reached a certain point where I thought ' OK , I can not stay any more .
This is finished ' , "" she says , remembering the pressure put on her by the regime after Body of Lies . ""
Although it was the best time ever [ professionally ] , I could choose whatever I wanted , I was really highly paid compared to other actresses , I could produce , I could do anything –
I chose to say goodbye . ""
Now the beneficiary of a liberty "" incomparable "" with the lives of her counterparts in Tehran , Farahani struggles with the creative legacy of that period of her life .
She finds herself automatically self - censoring and admits that even in a city more than 3,000 miles from home she does not feel completely free .
She worries for her family .
When she speaks to them , she knows she is also speaking to the intelligence services .
But , while she says her generation of Iranians have learned "" never to hope "" , she believes the movement for change could soon prove unstoppable .
Rather than another revolution , she says , they would like to see "" an evolution –
we want even the mullahs to live in peace "" .
"" It 's like a windscreen of a car : when there 's a little crack , it will be everywhere , "" she says .
"" Either you have to change it or it 's going to destroy itself .
And now the crack is there . """
2010-03-09,"There was a time when Iranian women seeking husbands prioritised job status and financial security – not to mention love – at the top of their list of needs .
Now potential suitors face the prospect of having to fulfil a daunting new requirement before asking for a bride 's hand – having the right government certificate .
Acquiring the appropriate official qualifications before popping the question is part of a plan for prenuptial training courses approved by the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , with the aim of reversing declining Iranian marriage rates and rising divorce statistics .
From next week , online courses will be offered to young people to prepare them for the pitfalls of married life .
The three - month courses , involving weekly tests , will be run by the state - governed national youth organisation , and those who successfully complete them will receive a certificate as proof of their readiness for matrimony .
Mohsen Zanganeh , the head of the national youth organisation for Tehran province , said the courses would provide young people with an understanding of the "" alphabet of life "" and were intended as an essential gateway to marriage .
"" We intend that within the next two years , if a boy attempts to woo a girl , she will answer only if he has finished his course , "" he told the Fars news agency .
"" We are trying to increase the level of information among young people concerning marriage . ""
Zangeneh said the course would run along similar lines to a universityand have a panel of 40 experts serving as its scientific board .
The idea has been partly prompted by the rising divorce rate .
Iranian decision - makers are also alarmed at a rise in the average marrying age , which scientists say is leading to an increase in premarital sex and abortions arising from unwanted pregnancies ."
2010-03-11,"It must have felt very uncomfortable for President Hamid Karzai to have his guest and "" brother "" , Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , use a press conference in Kabul to attack Afghanistan 's main donor and ally , the United States .
"" They themselves created terrorists and now they 're saying that they are fighting terrorists , "" said Ahmadinejad , accusing the US of playing a "" double game "" in Afghanistan .
Ahmadinejad was in fact returning a compliment by the US defence secretary , Robert Gates , who only hours earlier had accused Tehran of "" playing a double game "" of offering friendship to the Afghan government while at the same time giving "" low - level support "" and money to the Taliban .
Karzai had always hoped to be the mediator between Iran and America , yet on this occasion , unwittingly , he became the messenger of abuse .
He looked distinctly uneasy in the press conference , never knowing what Ahmadinejad may come up with in his next sentence . ""
Your country is located on the other side of the world , so what are you doing here ? "" said Ahmadinejad , criticising the US presence in Afghanistan .
Yet he did n't seem to be full of novel ideas for resolving the complex web of problems facing Afghanistan .
He suggested empowering "" the Afghan government , the legal Afghan government , and the legal government 's running of the country and its security issues "" .
His stress on the word "" legal "" was not without reason .
Like his own second term , Karzai 's election was marred by fraud .
Both men in fact share the precarious status of being regarded as contested presidents .
They were both the first to congratulate each other after the doubtful results of their election were announced .
Yet despite sharing this relative lack of authority , and despite the deep historical and cultural ties that link Iran and Afghanistan , the two men have a lot that sets them apart .
In Ahmadinejad 's frame of mind , Karzai is regarded as an American stooge and weak .
Karzai , in turn , views Ahmadinejad as being far too much of a fundamentalist and not necessarily as well - intentioned as he likes to pretend .
Thus there is lingering underlying distrust .
While Karzai has frequently praised Iran 's aid , he is watching cautiously where Iran 's hundreds of millions of dollars are spent .
Although much has gone towards drug eradication and humanitarian aid , the bulk of projects funded by Iran are focused in Herat province in western Afghanistan , near the border with Iran .
Funds have been pouring in for road and rail reconstruction along the main transit route between the two countries .
This aids the flow of trade – especially non - oil exports from Iran to Afghanistan – steadily rising from over £ 50 m in 2001 , now estimated to be £ 665 m .
The former powerful governor of Herat , General Ismail Khan , is a close ally of Iran .
When defeated by the Taliban in 1995 , Khan fled to Iran with thousands of his men .
Now Iran is building on that connection , improving trade links through Herat while keeping an eye on American movements along its eastern border .
Iran is concerned that Washington may use this border for espionage activity or for mounting a potential attack against Iran .
A further source of concern for Karzai is that Iran has close ties to Shia Muslims led by Karim Khalili – another former mujahideen leader who is currently the vice - president .
His Islamic Unity party was funded by Iran during the years of civil war and was the second most potent force against the Taliban .
Iran now funds major projects in areas densely populated by Shias , such as in Bamyan .
Some American security analysts argue that Iran holds these ties with the former mujahideen "" warlords "" in order to have the possibility of causing tension should the need arise .
They could be right , since president Ahmadinejad spent the rest of his visit meeting with them . ""
History shows that invading powers have never been victorious in Afghanistan , "" said Ahmadinejad at a luncheon attended by former mujahideen leaders .
He then met with two more : Sebghatollah Mojaddedi and Younis Qanooni , now presiding over Afghanistan 's senate and parliament respectively .
It was by using its contacts with these leaders that Iran helped Washington defeat the Taliban in 2001 .
However , now many of them have moved on and prefer the international forces to remain in Afghanistan .
So Robert Gates is probably wrong to assume that Iran is funding the Taliban .
Iran has long been an enemy of the Taliban , regarding them as Wahhabi Muslims funded by Saudi Arabia .
It prefers instead to invest in those players who are both anti - Taliban and anti - American .
And although many of those are currently in key political positions , Iran knows that when the time is right , they will switch sides .
In that sense , the US defence secretary is probably right to be concerned about Iran playing a "" double game "" , but then Afghanistan has always been a land of international and local double games ."
2010-03-19,"Iranian opposition supporters abroad are being urged to unite in a new Green Wave movement to work towards overthrowing a divided Islamic regime in Tehran .
Amir Jahanchahi , an exiled Iranian businessman , today called on his countrymen to rally round and act more decisively , suggesting that elements of the powerful Revolutionary Guard could be persuaded to turn against the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . ""
The opposition can not lead the street to victory , "" Jahanchahi said in an interview on the eve of the Iranian new year holiday .
"" The leaders are not ready to accept a full change of regime .
The Iranian people are ready to accept the truth that this regime will not be changed by a velvet revolution .
It has to be changed by force . ""
Jahanchahi , 49 , left Tehran after the 1979 Islamic revolution and has since lived in London and Paris .
His father was the country 's last finance minister under the shah .
Unlike many other Iranian exiles , he has no other citizenship .
Mir Hossein Mousavi , who claims to have won last June 's presidential election , has insisted that no one represents his Green movement outside Iran .
Jahanchahi said his Green Wave would be open to any Iranian who subscribed to democratic principles – although it was not clear whether that would exclude monarchists and groups such as the People 's Mujahedin , described as terrorists by the US and several other countries .
"" It will be a constellation of all the Iranian opposition , not an organisation or a party .
I do not represent anyone .
I am not Ahmed Chalabi , "" he said – a reference to the Iraqi exile who was highly influential in Washington before the 2003 US - led invasion but was later discredited .
The movement is to be fronted by Mehrdad Khonsari , a London - based Iranian academic .
Plans include convening a group of experts to draw up plans for a provisional government to take power once the regime has been overthrown .
Jahanchahi also talked of "" flooding the country with money "" to support transport strikes that would "" bring this regime to its knees "" , and of setting up a Farsi - language radio station to broadcast into Iran .
Jahanchahi argues that Iranians have proved themselves capable of heroic sacrifice since the disputed election , with scores of dead and thousands of arrests in protests met with a brutal crackdown .
In recent weeks the authorities appear to have regained the upper hand .
"" I want to transform the cells of discontent into cells of resistance , "" he said .
"" I will help people from the regime leave the country and admit to their mistakes . ""
He declined to explain how this would be done .
Jahanchahi is confident , persuasive and evidently wealthy – he lives in a luxurious home in one of London 's choicest residential areas and insists money is not a problem .
But he is unknown to Iranian opposition supporters at home or abroad .
"" There are a myriad of these self - publicising and self - proclaimed spokesmen and they are virtually all very dubious indeed , "" said one Green movement activist .
Jahanchahi compared himself to General Charles de Gaulle , who announced the fight against the Nazis from exile in London in 1940 .
Last year Jahanchahi published a book in French entitled The Iranian Hitler : Ending Ahmadinejad 's Dictatorship . ""
The Iranian regime needs to be overthrown by force , "" he said .
"" The key to all the problems of the Middle East is in my country .
The aim is not just to change the regime .
It will happen sooner or later .
The question is whether it can happen before Ahmadinejad leads Iran and the region into instability and war . """
2010-03-21,"If you imagined a computer hacker with the know - how to topple governments , you might well picture someone who looks a lot like Austin Heap .
He 's a 26-year - old programmer from San Francisco with long wavy hair , wearing jeans , T - shirt and aviator sunglasses the morning we meet .
He is also the creator of a piece of software called Haystack , which was a key technology used by Iranians to disseminate information outside the country in the protests that followed the disputed election result in June 2009 , when President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad unconvincingly triumphed against three challengers .
The Iranian government already filtered its citizens ' email and Skype conversations , but in the aftermath of the election , such censorship was increased in an attempt to identify dissidents who were using the web to organise and communicate with each other and with the outside world .
A tech wunderkind originally from Ohio , Heap developed Haystack to open up social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook , giving voices on the streets a platform , and people in the west a window into a closed - down state .
He 's now the executive director of the Censorship Research Centre in San Francisco , a non - profit organisation founded with his colleague Daniel Colascione to provide anti - censorship education , outreach , and technology for free to those who need it most .
What is Haystack and how does it work ?
Haystack is a piece of software that someone in Iran runs on his or her computer .
It does two things : first , it encrypts all of the data ; second it hides that data inside normal traffic so it looks like you 're visiting innocuous sites .
Daniel and I developed Haystack by looking at how the regime was using technology to filter the internet , and figured out the best strategy to get around it .
Why did you decide to take on the regime ?
I remember the day of the election , sitting around watching Twitter , watching what was going on , reading the election results and thinking , that looks weird .
Then I realised that the internet censorship had stepped up more than normal .
I thought , hey , I can set up a few proxies and help a few people out .
While I 'm at it , why not post instructions online
so other people could use their computers to get around the government filtering .
Imagine what you can do if you can watch someone 's internet connection : you can watch them log into GMail , you can watch them log into Facebook , you can see who they 're talking to , you can intercept messages .
That 's why the encryption part of Haystack was really important .
It had to start on the user 's side , on their computers .
Then it makes its way through the government filters .
Were you politically motivated ?
No .
I just remember sitting there watching the election results thinking , why are they violently reacting to people who were voting ?
It 's not like they were just jailing people ; they were killing people in the streets – people who had a different opinion , people who wanted to share their stories and voice what they thought was right .
It shocked me that someone would retaliate in such an inhumane way , and for someone to use the internet as a tool of oppression , as a tool to stop dialogue .
I gather that according to US law , it was illegal to export Haystack to Iran , simply because it would flout Iranian laws
–
but it did virally make its way onto Iranian computers
…
I 'll never forget the first person who got a copy of Haystack and sent me a screenshot of Twitter .
All of a sudden , the internet was open again .
Haystack also allowed people to make Skype calls back to their families securely .
It allowed people to send GMail without worrying that someone would try to steal their password or monitor their communication .
It gave them a layer of protection that allowed the random person to be a citizen journalist and to do so without the risk of persecution , jail or torture .
Is there content that should n't be spread around the web ?
The internet is used for anything from drug trafficking to human trafficking .
That 's completely wrong .
But when you decide that you 're going to support an open internet , you have to open all of it .
You ca n't go down this slippery slope of saying what 's right and what 's wrong .
Who is this panel of people who 's going to say this is OK , this is not OK ?
Outside the obvious things that are human rights violations , free speech is free speech .
Is n't that a very American point of view ?
I do n't think [ Haystack ] has anything to do with American ideology .
I think that if you look at what the UN has listed as basic human rights , one of those is the ability to freely and openly communicate .
No one should ever have to stop and say , "" Can I be this ?
Can I think this ?
Can I say this ? ""
It 's what we as people deserve .
Who are your greatest critics ?
I do n't even know where to start .
I have a whole fan club of people who hate me .
There 's clearly been opposition by the Iranian government .
They recently passed a law that makes it illegal to use software or proxies that evade the censorship that they 've imposed .
They 're detractor number one .
In my day - to - day life I meet people who do n't support what I do .
One of the most shocking examples was when someone came up to me and said , "" Do n't you get that Ahmadinejad is our Obama ? ""
That took me back .
After Google announced it was leaving China , the Chinese government said that US - originated systems that opened up the governmental web blockades – such as Haystack - were acts of terrorism .
Are you a terrorist ?
It 's interesting .
There are a lot of things that they [ China ] do and pursue , a lot of laws that I do n't feel anyone should observe .
They have a long history of jailing dissidents and people who republish old cartoons .
They pick and choose how to enforce laws and they come up with laws that frankly I would consider an act of terrorism of mankind .
Maybe we should agree that we 're both the same kind of threat , but to one another .
Hilary Clinton made a speech recently that outlined the US State Department 's policy on web freedom .
She argued that there was no place for censorship .
What 's the relationship now between the US government and Haystack ?
I do n't like the view that Haystack is a puppet of the US State Department , but I 'm happy to see that the State Department is standing up for a free and open web .
They have a long history of protecting human rights around the world and documenting abuses .
This is the next step .
We live in such an interconnected world .
Policy makers , organisations that draft and enforce these policies need to catch up .
And they are .
What 's next for Austin Heap and for Haystack ?
There are a lot of places around the world that are either severely censored now that could use people like me and tools such as Haystack , and they need to be addressed .
That includes everywhere from Australia , which is currently dipping its toes in the censorship pool , to Egypt where there are more bloggers jailed than journalists : this is a global problem .
The way Haystack was developed was that we looked at how Iran specifically does its filtering and we came up with a method around it .
If you look at what China does with their filtering , they use wildly different technology and have spent millions , hundreds of millions on their censorship .
They 're probably the best censors in the world .
We hope to run down the list .
Take on each country that has decided that it 's going to try to use the internet against people ."
2010-04-22,"For some the scene would have called to mind Henry Kissinger 's remark about the Iran - Iraq war : too bad both ca n't lose .
Two arch - nemeses of the west , Robert Mugabe and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , came face to face in Harare today despite criticism of Zimbabwe 's president for inviting his Iranian counterpart .
The state visit has driven a wedge between Mugabe and the prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , whose party condemned it as "" a colossal political scandal "" and "" an insult to the peace - loving people of Zimbabwe and Iran "" .
Mugabe greeted Ahmadinejad at Harare airport thisafternoon and was due to host a state dinner for him .
Tsvangirai and leading ministers from his Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) are to boycott the entire trip .
Iran is the biggest exhibitor at an international trade show that Ahmadinejad is due to open in Zimbabwe 's second city of Bulawayo tomorrow .
He is the first leader from outside Africa to open the show since Zimbabwe became independent 30 years ago .
The MDC , partner of Mugabe 's Zanu - PF in a unity government , criticised the "" unilateral "" decision to invite Ahmadinejad , whose uranium enrichment programme and human rights abuses have made him a bogeyman in the west .
The MDC said : "" His visit will definitely send a wrong message about the kind of company that we keep at a time when the people of Africa and the rest of the world have begun to see us as a nation working hard to restore democracy and good governance . ""
The party , which observers agree was robbed of election victory in 2008 by a campaign of violence and intimidation , drew parallels between Mugabe and Ahmadinejad 's strong - arm tactics .
The MDC said while the teetotal Ahmadinejad would be "" wining and dining "" in Zimbabwe , nine opposition activists in Iran faced death sentences for contesting the outcome of last year 's presidential election .
The party added : "" Choice of friends defines character and inviting the Iranian strongman to an investment forum is like inviting a mosquito to cure malaria . ""
Hobnobbing with dubious political leaders confirms stereotypes that we are a banana republic .
"" If a man is to be judged by his friends , Mugabe has some image problems to repair .
His visit to North Korea in the early 1980s to seek help from dictator Kim Il - sung is widely blamed for leading to the Gukurahundi massacre , in which more than 20,000 Zimbabweans died .
Mugabe is also said to have been close to Nicolae Ceausescu and to have considered his Romania a model socialist state .
Rumour has it that he was so inconsolable on learning of Ceausescu 's execution that he did not eat for three days .
Zanu - PF has always enjoyed ties with China , which is flooding Zimbabwe with cheap products .
Earlier this year , Mugabe attended an 86th birthday party held in his honour at the Chinese embassy in Harare – the first time he had visited a foreign embassy in the country during his three decades in power .
But on a different note , guests at Mugabe 's 1996 wedding to Grace Marufu included the then South African president , Nelson Mandela , while Joaquim Chissano , the impeccably democratic president of Mozambique , was best man .
Zimbabwe 's Herald newspaper , a mouthpiece of Zanu - PF , said Ahmadinejad 's visit came after the west had declared Iran "" an axis of evil "" and Zimbabwe a pariah state .
It accused the west of wanting to bully both countries using "" the might of its weapons of mass destruction "" .
"" The west 's neocolonial agenda should only make us stronger , "" it said in an editorial .
But the diplomatic embrace of Ahmadinejad was criticised by human rights groups .
McDonald Lewanika , co - ordinator of the Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition , said : "" Clearly his track record shows he is not the best kind of person to associate with .
They have a lot in common .
They are both experts are repressing their people , both experts at killing their electorates .
This visit is an unfortunate and unhelpful thing for Zimbabwe . ""
Simbarashe Mumbengegwi , the foreign minister and a Mugabe ally , said Zimbabwe would benefit from the trip by signing several trade and co - operation agreements with the oil - rich country .
After Zimbabwe , Ahmadinejad is due to visit Uganda , where oil has recently been discovered .

2010-04-22,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's friends are not all quite as controversial as he is on the world stage but like his host in Harare , Robert Mugabe , few of them are routinely welcome in western capitals .
Elsewhere in Africa the Iranian president has hobnobbed with the Sudanese president , Omar al - Bashir , who is wanted by the international criminal court for war crimes allegedly committed in Darfur – a charge vehemently denied by Khartoum .
Last year Ahmadinejad is distrusted by the conservative , pro - western Arab states , who worry about him acquiring nuclear weapons .
But in March 2008 he became the first Iranian president ever to visit Iraq , which fought a bloody eight - year war against the Islamic Republic in the 1980s .
He has also held talks with another neighbour , the Turkish president , Abdullah Gul .
His closest ally in the Middle East is Syria 's Bashar al - Assad , who inherited the strategic relationship between Damascus and Tehran from his father , Hafez , and refuses to bow to US pressure to end it .
Last month Ahmadinejad held a summit with Assad and Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah , leader of Lebanon 's Hizbullah .
Europe is largely off limits to Ahmadinejad : he attended a UN food security summit in Rome in 2008 but was shunned by Silvio Berlusconi .
The previous year he was a guest of President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus , who is often described as Europe 's last dictator and another of the world 's most isolated leaders .
Appearances at the UN in New York are the closest he gets to North America , where his anti - Americanism , Holocaust denial and hostility to Israel are deeply disliked .
But he has been most welcome in Latin America .
Brazil was his first foreign destination –
President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva criticised attempts to isolate Iran over its nuclear programme .
Ahmadinejad 's best friend is Venezuela 's Hugo Chávez who has backed Tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
Chavez and Ahamdinejad have visited each other several times and co - operation between their countries has grown .
Both are are oil producers and members of Opec .
Ahmadinejad boasted earlier this month that Iran was emerging as a "" new power in the world "" which would welcome better relations with any country "" except the Zionist regime whose legitimacy has not been recognised . """
2010-04-24,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the president of Iran , discovered the split personality of Zimbabwe 's government when he visited the country last week .
There was a warm welcome at Harare airport from the president , Robert Mugabe , who hosted a state dinner in his honour and assured the "" comrade president "" of Zimbabwe 's continuous support of Iran 's "" just cause "" on the nuclear issue .
But the prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , was less hospitable .
His party , the Movement for Democratic Change , described the trip as "" a colossal political scandal "" and said that inviting Ahmadinejad to an investment forum is "" like inviting a mosquito to cure malaria "" .
The mixed signals underlined the perils inherent in the concept of a "" unity "" government , a growing trend in Africa .
Power sharing can often become a power struggle by other means .
A peace deal in Kenya was salvaged from the ashes of post - election violence in 2008 .
But divisions run deep in the fractious coalition , with the president , Mwai Kibaki and prime minister Raila Odinga often pulling in opposite directions and threatening a constitutional crisis .
The protagonists in Madagascar 's political deadlock have agreed to talks in South Africa this week , with international mediators pushing for another inclusive solution .
Opposition politicians joined a unity government in Ivory Coast earlier this year after the previous one was sacked .
But the country remains in stalemate ahead of long - awaited elections .
Zimbabwe 's grandly named "" global political agreement "" , signed after disputed elections in 2008 , is probably the most notorious example , described by one report as trench warfare every day .
Ministers from Mugabe 's Zanu - PF and Tsvangirai 's MDC regularly issue contradictory statements , most recently on the introduction of a controversial indigenisation law stipulating that every company must have at least 51 % of its shares owned by black Zimbabweans .
"" Something has to give .
It 's untenable , "" said Nelson Chamisa , a government minister and MDC spokesman .
"" You have a half - donkey , half - horse arrangement .
The nature of the beast is something that is a puzzle , even for the people who brought it into being . ""
Along with their practical inefficiencies , unity governments are accused of defying the democratic will .
If two sets of politicians are in power there is no longer an opposition to hold them accountable and the electorate has lost its right to choose .
But for pragmatists they appear to be the imperfect answer to a deeply imperfect situation .
Blessing - Miles Tendi , a Zimbabwean academic at Oxford University , noted in an interview that unity governments shelve rather than solve problems but added : "" It 's easy for you and me and many others to sit there , deliberate and criticise power sharing
but there 's a big elephant in the room :
had there been no power sharing in Zimbabwe and Kenya , flawed as it is , what other option did we have ? """
2010-05-04,"The Mahmoud Ahmadinejad show arrived at the UN for the sixth time , and much like its previous episodes , it did not disappoint .
His speech contained its usual anti - Israel and anti - US diatribe but , surprisingly , this year he also had some interesting and salient points .
One of them was the fact that he lambasted the US for threatening his country with nuclear weapons .
He has a point .
It boggles the mind as to why Obama recently stated that based upon the new US nuclear doctrine , the US would not use nuclear weapons against any country which does not possess them , with the exception of Iran .
This was a huge setback for Obama 's outreach strategy to Iran .
It was also a huge gift for the ultra - conservatives there .
After Obama 's declaration , many of them could now say that their country is under a nuclear threat , and the best way to prevent this from happening is through the acquisition of nuclear weapons .
That way , the US would be deterred from launching a nuclear attack against their country .
Obama should be dissuading Iranians from backing the regime 's nuclear drive , not encouraging them .
What the US president should have done was to include Iran in the list of other countries , and not single it out as the only one that may be attacked , despite the fact that it does not have nuclear weapons , yet .
Or if Obama really wanted to scare the Iranian leadership , he could have said that in the case of Iran , the US will adopt a policy of ambiguity .
This US misstep could not have come at a worse time .
Increasing numbers of Iranians now see their country 's nuclear drive as a Khamenei - Ahmadinejad project , rather than a nationalistic one .
If a survey were held in Iran , it 's quite likely that majority of Iranians would say yes to a nuclear Iran , both in terms of energy and weapons .
However , when it comes to the question "" do you want Iran to become nuclear under this regime ? ""
, the answer is likely to be very different .
It would be a fair and accurate estimation to say that many people , maybe even the majority , would say no – the reasons here being related to the regime 's tarnished image at home and loss of legitimacy .
Also , increasing numbers of people in Iran are worried that if this regime becomes nuclear , it would use its power not for the betterment of their lives but for the opposite .
It would use its new status to confront the west , thus making Iran more isolated , both economically and politically .
Now that Obama has handed Ahmadinejad a victory in a battle which he was badly losing , he should refocus his strategies .
When it comes to addressing Iran , Obama should continue with his outreach to the people of Iran .
If he wants to hurt the regime with words , Obama stands no chance against the champion , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
He should let him do that .
Nobody does a better job .
In fact , one should wonder whether negotiations with such a regime are relevant any more .
Of course we all should try to settle our differences through dialogue , and the US and the west should try to find a peaceful solution for Iran 's nuclear programme and human rights .
Whether or not this regime would want to deliver such a solution is another matter .
The demonstrators in Iran may have been brutally put down through arrests , killings , torture and rape .
However the Green movement in Iran is not passing blip , as the Iranian government and Flynt Leverret would like us to believe .
The wide cracks created in Iranian elections after the 2009 presidential still remain , and there is no sign of their reparation .
If anything , they are getting bigger , and the regime is becoming more desperate to divert the public 's attention away from them , by blaming "" foreign elements "" for everything that goes wrong in the country .
The recent case of the missing statues in Tehran is one example which shows this .
Over the last three weeks , 10 statues which were housed in public areas have been stolen by thieves .
These include the statutes of historic figures such as Sattar Khan , who was a heroic figure in Iran 's constitutional revolution , as well as Ibn Sina ( Avicenna ) who was a famous Persian physician , poet and mathematician .
According to the mayor of Tehran , Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf , these statues – one of which weighed half a ton – were most probably stolen by a gang equipped with a JCB .
No sooner had this been announced than officials in Iran 's heritage organisation pointed the finger of blame at the UK .
Citing Britain 's "" history in pillaging Iranian artefacts "" , these recent thefts have now been blamed on "" the secret hand of England "" .
It 's difficult to imagine the SAS arriving with JCBs to cut huge statutes in the middle of Tehran .
Not only would they face security obstacles , they would find Tehran 's traffic a nightmare .
It is equally difficult to see these statutes being spirited away to Sotheby 's or the British Museum by British buyers , since financially they are unlikely to be worth the journey .
However such accusations , alongside blaming of the 9/11 attacks on the US are part and parcel of a regime which is not interested in reaching a deal with the west because , if it does , that could be the end of it ."
2010-05-05,"The US and other countries have spent much time and effort hunting down Osama bin Laden , to no avail .
Maybe it 's time to be thinking outside the box – and when it comes to thinking outside the box , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the president of Iran , has few peers .
Ahmadinejad sat down with ABC 's George Stephanopoulos for an interview yesterday .
In a wide - ranging and at times surreal exchange , Stephanopoulos asked the Iranian president about reports that bin Laden was secretly living in Tehran .
Some less - than - Pulitzer Prize - winning journalism from Stephanopoulos followed .
"" Your question is laughable , "" was Ahmadinejad 's response .
Sadly , things went downhill from there , as you can see from the transcript :
Stephanopoulos :
If you did know that Osama bin Laden was in Tehran , would you show him hospitality ?
Would you expel him ?
Would you arrest him ?
Ahmadinejad :
I heard that Osama bin Laden is in Washington DC .
Stephanopoulos :
No , you did n't .
Ahmadinejad :
Yes , I did .
He 's there .
Because he was a previous partner of Mr Bush .
They were colleagues in fact in the old days .
You know that .
They were in the oil business together .
They worked together .
Mr bin Laden never cooperated with Iran but he cooperated with Mr Bush .
Later : Stephanopoulos : But you deny categorically that he 's in Tehran today ?
He is not , Osama bin Laden is not in Tehran today ?
Ahmadinejad :
Rest assured that he 's in Washington .
I think there 's a high chance he 's there .
Stephanopoulos :
I do n't agree .
Thank you for your time , Mr President .
You 're probably thinking : that 's just plain nuts .
And you 'd be right .
But think about it .
Washington DC by its nature , with all its embassies and organisations such as the IMF , is the ideal place for a wealthy outsider to blend into .
Plus , there 's some nice museums
and Osama could indulge his interest in foreign policy .
( Although he would probably live in Bethesda , where half of the World Bank resides , and technically that 's Maryland but let 's not quibble . )
But Ahmadinejad ca n't be right .
If Bin Laden really lived in DC he would have gone to the White House correspondents dinner on Saturday , along with other celebrities such as Justin Bieber .
After all , Rupert Murdoch was there .
Update :
The subject of OBL - DC was brought up at the State Department press briefing yesterday , by spokesman Philip Crowley and the fun - loving Washington press corps at Foggy Bottom : Crowley : And finally before taking you questions , over the past few hours , we 've done an intensive search here at the Department of State – every nook and cranny , every rock – and we can safely report that Osama bin Ladin is not here .
[ Laughter . ]
No , it was an interview with the president ....
Question :
Right – greater Washington or you 've looked at the State Department ?
Crowley : Just the confines of our State Department , but it was reported by the president of Iran that he is here in Washington .
That 's news to us .
And thank you for laughing , by the way .
Question :
Let 's hope we do n't find him here after you 've said that .
Crowley :
I 'm pretty confident of that .
Question :
I do n't know .
There were some strange looking people down at the cafeteria .
[ Laughter . ]
Bet that went down well in the cafeteria ."
2010-05-05,"President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad yesterday brushed off the threat of a new round of UN sanctions over Iran 's nuclear programme .
The Iranian leader said fresh sanctions would mean that Barack Obama had given up on his campaign to engage Iran diplomatically . ""
While we do not welcome sanctions , we do not fear them either , "" Ahmadinejad told reporters in New York .
"" We feel that the US government will be damaged more than us by those sanctions . ""
His show of defiance came as the US and its allies are negotiating on further sanctions against Tehran .
The Russian deputy foreign minister , Sergei Ryabkov , said he was "" reasonably optimistic "" that an agreement can be reached on a fourth round of sanctions over Iran 's uranium enrichment programme .
"" I do believe the talks are slowly moving forward .
There 's definitely some space to bridge over .
But I would n't over - exaggerate the differences , "" Ryabkov said .
A refined - oil blockade was discussed last year but appears to have faded as an option .
Britain opposes it , partly because it would be almost impossible to enforce , and would boost the smuggling industry on Iran 's borders .
The west is looking at sanctions that would hurt Iran 's Revolutionary Guard , which has control over the nuclear programme .
But the Revolutionary Guard also has many economic interests , so targeting them could affect ordinary Iranians .
Ahmadinejad , who is in New York for a month - long international conference on nuclear non - proliferation , launched a scathing attack on the US earlier in the week , accusing it of overseeing a global system with double standards .
In a speech which overran his five - minute slot by half an hour , he said : "" Regrettably , the government of the US has not only used nuclear weapons , but continues to threaten to use such weapons against other countries , including Iran . ""
Ahmadinejad also had harsh words for the UN 's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency , which he said had been "" unsuccessful in discharging its responsibilities "" because of the influence of the US over its management .
He called for the US to be removed from the agency 's board of governors and be subjected to a formal UN rebuke for the use of nuclear threats .
He insisted there was not a "" single credible proof "" Iran was developing weapons .
Delegations from the US , Britain and other EU states walked out , but his speech was greeted with applause from many remaining delegates .
The US sought to seize the high ground at the conference by revealing for the first time the size of its nuclear arsenal , 5,113 warheads , in a move intended to signal Washington is serious about disarmament .
In a message to the conference , Obama pointed to an arms control agreement with Russia last month ."
2010-05-17,"Iranian officials have announced a new agreement , mediated by Brazil and Turkey , to send low - enriched uranium to Turkey in exchange for receiving nuclear fuel for an Iranian nuclear reactor .
The deal brokers , Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Brazil 's president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , announced the deal raising their arms in victory , hand in hand with Iran 's contested president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Before getting our hopes too high , however , it is important to remember that the agreement still needs international approval .
The Iranian foreign ministry spokesman , Ramin Mehmanparast , said Iran would present the details in a formal letter to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) within a week .
Iran will then wait for a positive response from "" the Vienna group "" , which he described as comprising the IAEA , France , Russia and the US .
Once their full agreement had been received , Iran would wait for a further month to start shipping its uranium to Turkey for safekeeping .
The exchange of fuel will take place under the supervision of the IAEA and Iran .
Crucial to the success of this new initiative is that the west should agree to send , in exchange for 1,200 kg of Iran 's 3.5 % low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) , 120 kg of 20 % enriched uranium .
Otherwise , Iran warns , "" there will be no deal "" .
So the question is whether the international community is willing to send this potentially dangerous amount of highly enriched uranium to Iran .
Iran claims that its aim is to use the enriched fuel only for civilian purposes , but it is , at the same time , widely reported that to make further progress on its nuclear programme Iran is desperately in need of highly enriched uranium , which it is struggling to produce .
So , while there is no change in the core deal presented by Iran , what are the new elements in today 's agreement that could possibly lead to a different outcome ?
First , judging by the previous failed agreement in Vienna , the international community may not be keen on providing Iran with enriched uranium that might be used for military purposes .
Yet at the same time , the west has had too many failures in dealing with Iran and may not be sure of achieving full endorsement of its sanctions at the UN .
If that were the case , then the Vienna group will have to come up with a new deal , which may in turn require further negotiations on the details .
Second , this time the initiative is from Iran , so it does indicate a change of heart .
Iran has been increasingly concerned that it is reaching a dead end in acquiring the enriched uranium it so badly needs .
Its failed attempts at Vienna and Geneva raised internal criticisms – hence Iran 's further exploration of a deal through more trusted intermediaries such as Turkey and Brazil .
Third , the intermediation , especially by Brazil , seems to have the backing of both the US and Russia .
The Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , described Lula 's visit to Iran as "" the last chance "" to persuade Tehran before sanctions would be imposed .
A similar warning came from the US .
If Lula fails , the world powers ' efforts to persuade Iran to take responsibility for its nuclear programme should end , and sanctions against the country should be tightened , US state department spokesman Philip Crowley said last week .
Moreover , Iran was concerned about reports of "" good progress "" being made on securing support from all security council permanent members – including China – regarding further targeted sanctions against Iran .
The official Iranian news agency , IRNA , reported that Ahmadinejad was now inviting the international community to enter into talks with Tehran .
"" I hope the 5 + 1 [ UN security council permanent members plus Germany ] enter talks with honesty , respect and fairness and heed the great work started in Tehran , "" it quoted him as saying .
Another reason for Iran 's choice of timing is that in mid - June , the first anniversary of the contested presidential elections could bring new protests to the streets of Tehran and major cities .
Iran has tried to claim that it has dealt successfully with the crisis .
Yet the ruling establishment is well aware of the dangers of further escalation of tension .
It is also aware that international sanctions could have a negative impact on the economy and thus exasperate the protests .
So now that the international community has put its hopes in the success of the mission by Brazil and Turkey , and now that Iran is keener than ever before on making a deal , the prospects appear relatively positive .
However , the linchpin of the new agreement is the provision of enriched uranium to a country that has thus far been highly distrusted in the west .
By striking such a deal with the west , the Iranian regime will boast success at home and in the international arena – a success highly undeserved by a government with such an abysmal record on human rights ; a government whose press is silenced and whose main opposition leaders are either in prison or barred from movement .
Inside Iran , any deal on nuclear exchange may thus be viewed on the one hand as positive , in that it may reduce the possibility of a military strike and the chance of imposing sanctions .
However , at the same time , a deal with Iran – especially if it is sealed with its contested president at this particular political juncture , after a year of brutal clampdown on opposition – will be viewed by all supporters of civil society with deep scepticism and disappointment ."
2010-05-18,"In American wrestling parlance , it would be called the "" P5 Smackdown "" .
The permanent five members of the Security Council flattened Brazil and Turkey 's effort at mediating the Iran crisis , sending a clear message that only the big boys ( and they are all boys ) make or break the big deals .
The announcement of a new sanctions package came only a few hours after the Brazilian president , Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , and the Turkish prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdogan stood on either side of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , declaring peace in our time .
They claimed to have finally clinched the long - delayed uranium swap deal , by arranging for 1200 kg of Iran 's enriched uranium to be shipped to Turkey , and there would be no more need for sanctions .
Hillary Clinton did not bother to hide her disdain when she informed the Senate of the new P5 sanctions proposals .
"" This announcement is as convincing an answer to the efforts undertaken by Tehran over the last few days as any we could provide . "" More striking still was the agreement from Russia and China to push for the package so soon after the news of the Turkish - Brazilian - Iranian deal .
In the eyes of Turkey and Brazil and other middle - ranking , emerging powers , all this embodies the inequity of the international system , in which control is concentrated in the hands of a few states who emerged winners of a war 65 years ago .
Turkey and Brazil are non - permanent Security Council members with no veto , forever bit players in the global drama , their emollient peacemaking gifts wasted .
From the point of view of the P5 , the Turkish - Brazilian intervention was a bungling bid for influence , in which leaders of both countries were suckered by Iranian flattery into thinking the impasse over Iran 's nuclear ambitions was a mere misunderstanding which they could resolve with a little sympathetic mediation .
There were indeed big holes in the deal .
On May 6 , the Iranian foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , invited diplomats from the 15 Security Council members to dinner in New York .
It was meant to be a charm offensive , but backfired badly when Mottaki insisted Iran would press ahead with 20 % enrichment , whether or not the uranium swap deal was done .
That claim , blithely repeated on Monday by the foreign ministry spokesman in Tehran , stunned the assembled diplomats .
Iran 's pretext for embarking on 20 % uranium enrichment back in February was to make fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor ( although it does not have the capacity to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods ) .
Once that pretext had been taken out the picture by the uranium exchange , there were no credible civilian purposes for uranium enriched to that level .
This , more than anything else , seems to have stiffened the resolve of the P5 .
Article 1 of the Turkey - Brazil - Iran initiative endorsed Iran 's right to pursue "" the nuclear fuel cycle including enrichment activities "" , contradicting a string of UN Security Council resolutions calling on Iran to stop .
If this was deliberate , it is a clear challenge to the Security Council 's continuing authority .
Thirdly , Monday 's joint declaration welcomed Iran 's readiness to talk to the 5 + 1 powers ( P5+Germany ) "" on the common concerns based on collective commitments according to the common points of their proposals "" .
The problem with this is that Iran 's proposal for talks omits any mention of its nuclear programme .
Its insistence of discussing the "" common points "" is code for "" no nuclear talks "" .
It is still possible that if some of these holes are addressed when the uranium exchange initiative goes before the IAEA ( supposedly in the next week ) and if Iran agrees to stop enriching to 20 % , the sanctions machinery could slow down or pause .
But the speed with which Russia and China signed up to the sanctions draft after Monday 's "" breakthrough "" in Tehran , suggests that Iran will now have to do much more than that .
As for Turkey and Brazil , this experience will leave behind a bitter taste and a renewed sense of inequity .
That could damage hopes of consensus at the NPT Review Conference still underway in New York , and pile on yet more pressure for UN reform ."
2010-06-08,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , today said his country would not give any more ground on its nuclear programme as the UN security council prepared to vote on more sanctions against Tehran .
Ahmadinejad said a fuel swap deal , negotiated with Turkey and Brazil , was an opportunity for the US and its allies to break the deadlock that would "" not be repeated "" .
The deal resurrected elements of a UN - backed offer for Tehran to part with 1,200 kg of low enriched uranium – potential nuclear weapons material – in return for special fuel rods to make medical isotopes .
US officials have criticised the deal as too little , too late – partly because it would not stop Iran enriching uranium – and described it as an attempt to delay sanctions .
"" The meeting in Tehran [ where the deal was brokered ] created an opportunity for the US administration and for its allies , and we still hope that they will be able to use this opportunity , "" Ahmadinejad said .
"" We say that this opportunity will not be repeated . ""
He warned that , if the US failed to change its stance , "" the first ones to lose would be President Obama and the people of the United States "" .
Speaking on the sidelines of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia ( CICA ) summit in Istanbul , Ahmadinejad also criticised Russia – whose prime minister , Vladimir Putin , was attending the conference – for backing the sanctions .
Although Russia , together with China , worked to dilute some of the stronger proposed measures , the Iranian leader warned it to "" be careful not to be beside the enemies of the Iranian people "" .
The vote on fresh sanctions could happen as early as tomorrow , and is expected to encounter little resistance .
Turkey , Brazil and Lebanon are not expected to vote for the resolution , but none has a veto .
The draft resolution calls for measures against new Iranian banks abroad if a connection to Iran 's nuclear or missile programmes is suspected , as well as vigilance over transactions with any Iranian bank , including the central bank .
It would also expand the UN arms embargo against Tehran .
Western powers fear Iran is covertly developing nuclear weapons but the Tehran regime maintains it is enriching uranium for peaceful purposes ."
2010-06-08,"Iran will break off all talks over its nuclear programme if new sanctions are imposed , a defiant President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad warned today , as the UN security council put the finishing touches to a package of punitive measures that is expected to be passed tomorrow .
Ahmadinejad said the US and its allies had "" missed an opportunity "" by not taking up the recent nuclear swap agreement between Iran , Turkey and Brazil .
It was rejected as too little too late , and because Iran insisted on continuing to enrich uranium in the face of international demands for suspension .
The fear is that Tehran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons , though it denies intending to .
"" We still hope they will be able to use this opportunity , but we say this opportunity will not be repeated , "" the Iranian president said .
He added : "" The US government and its allies are mistaken if they think they can brandish the stick of a [ UN]resolution and then sit down to talk with us – such a thing will not happen . ""
Speaking at a Eurasian security summit in Istanbul , Ahmadinejad made a last - ditch attempt to persuade Russia not to back the latest sanctions , the fourth series since 2006 .
Russian officials said the resolution had been agreed by all five permanent – veto - wielding – members of the security council , though the prime minister , Vladimir Putin , also in Istanbul , said the measures should not be excessive . ""
These decisions should not put the Iranian people in a complicated position which would put up barriers on the path to peaceful nuclear energy , "" Putin said .
Mexico 's ambassador to the UN , Claude Heller , the current council president , said the security council vote would take place tomorrow afternoon .
The new sanctions will target senior figures in the Iranian regime , the Revolutionary Guards and firms involved in Iran 's nuclear and missile programmes .
The resolution will also expand an existing arms embargo and tighten restrictions on the Iranian financial and shipping industries .
A leaked draft text of the resolution requests member states to inform the UN of "" any information on transfers or activity by ... vessels owned or operated by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines ( IRISL ) ... that may have been undertaken in order to evade the sanctions .
"" Many ships have been renamed and put under new management to evade controls .
Western countries had sought tougher measures – some targeting Iran 's vital energy sector – but China and Russia worked to dilute those steps to protect their own energy interests .
Another objection was that costlier fuel or a wider trade embargo would harm ordinary Iranians far more than the regime .
The US , Britain and France believe sanctions could have a psychological impact at a time of severe economic crisis , though analysts point out that three previous rounds have not changed Iran 's policy .
Iran 's foreign ministry predicted today that any new measures would prove ineffective .
The difference is that these are the first sanctions since the unrest and repression following last year 's disputed presidential elections , likely to be marked by protests on Saturday .
Turkey , Brazil and Lebanon , all non - permanent members of the 15-strong security council , are expected to vote against the resolution or to abstain .
The security council held a private meeting yesterday , to partially meet the concerns of Brazil and Turkey , who had called for an open "" political debate "" on the broader Iranian nuclear issue first .
The Brazilian president , Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , and the Turkish prime minster , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , have said that the fuel swap agreement , while not addressing all of the international community 's concerns about Iran 's nuclear programme , makes more sanctions unnecessary ."
2010-06-08,"Concerns about Iran 's nuclear programme should not prevent international action over human rights abuses by the Islamic regime since last year 's disputed election , Amnesty International warns today .
Cataloguing intensifying repression by the regime and its shadowy intelligence services , Amnesty also calls for a "" concerted and robust response towards the failure of the Iranian authorities to address human rights concerns "" .
Its report , From Protests to Prison , says at least 5,000 people have been arrested since the mass protests that erupted a day after Mahmoud Ahmadinejad claimed victory over Mir Hossein Mousavi , the Green movement leader , in the disputed presidential election of 12 June last year .
Torture , beatings , rape and solitary confinement have all been used , with hundreds sentenced after unfair trials to lengthy prison sentences . ""
Unlawful killings and all too frequent reports of torture and other ill - treatment by state actors who enjoy near total impunity are still not being investigated , "" Amnesty says .
Claudio Cordone , Amnesty 's interim secretary general , said : "" The Iranian government is determined to silence all dissenting voices while at the same time trying to avoid all scrutiny by the international community into the violations connected to the post - election unrest . ""
Amnesty documents show how new laws criminalise website use and contact with more than 60 foreign institutions , media organisations and NGOs .
Newspapers have been closed down , websites and email services filtered or blocked .
Political activists , journalists , film - makers , students , human rights defenders and lawyers have all been arrested .
Action has also intensified against already banned groups such as monarchists , Bahá'ís and the People 's Mujahideen .
Arbitrary arrest , detention without trial , disappearances , torture and forced confessions are extensively documented .
So far this year , 115 people have been executed .
Iran has one of the highest rates of executions in the world .
Women in detention have frequently reported sexual insults and threats of rape .
Zahra Kamali told Amnesty her interrogators taunted her with wanting to sleep with other men , and sometimes touched her breasts .
An unnamed woman activist reported having cables attached to her nipples and given electric shocks .
"" Threats against family members , especially mothers , wives and daughters , are a potent means of pressuring detainees to comply with their interrogators ' demands , "" the report says .
"" Detainees who may have already experienced torture and other ill - treatment are faced with the fear of similar treatment being meted out to their loved ones . ""
In the one 15-minute meeting Arash Rahmanipour had with his lawyer after he was sentenced to death and before his execution , he said he had falsely "" confessed "" after his pregnant sister was threatened with harm in front of him .
His sister later miscarried after her release .
"" Confessions "" all bear a striking resemblance , the report says .
Individuals in show trials are shown "" confessing "" to contacts with foreigners , which is often interpreted as espionage , usually for the US or UK .
The individuals usually state that they had been "" misguided "" and express repentance for their alleged "" crimes "" .
There are reports that some may have been drugged before making confessions .
Amnesty also condemns "" politically motivated executions "" which have taken place before key anniversaries when mass protests are expected .
At least six people remain on death row charged with "" enmity against God "" for their alleged involvement in demonstrations and membership of banned groups .
Iranians living in exile , in Turkey and elsewhere , have been subject to threats .
Nobel Peace Laureate Shirin Ebadi , who has received many death threats , was out of the country at the time of the election and has not felt safe enough to return .
Abolfazl Fateh , former head of Mousavi 's information committee , and a student in the UK , has reportedly received death threats from individuals claiming to be working for the Iranian ministry of intelligence ."
2010-06-09,"It was described as the "" Twitter revolution "" , but almost a year on from Iran 's disputed presidential elections , during which the use of social media by the opposition movement made headlines around the world , such claims prompt wry smiles from seasoned observers .
Carried away by the enthusiasm of the protests , tens of thousands of Twitter users across the world switched their locations to Tehran in an attempt to confuse Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's henchmen .
The US state department official who persuaded Twitter to delay a technical upgrade of its software so that it did n't occur during a protest was described as the "" man who saved Iran "" .
And a former aide to George Bush even suggested awarding
Twitter the Nobel peace prize for its role in the Iran crisis .
Such hyperbole reveals more about western fantasies for new media than the reality in Iran , argues Hamid Tehrani , the Persian editor of the blogging network Global Voices .
"" The west was focused not on the Iranian people but on the role of western technology , "" he says .
"" Twitter was important in publicising what was happening , but its role was overemphasised . ""
Tehrani estimates that there were fewer than 1,000 active Twitter users in Iran at the time of the election .
"" Some people did provide updates from Tehran , but many did n't check out .
When someone tweeted that there were 700,000 people demonstrating in front of a mosque , it turned out that only around 7,000 people showed up . ""
The Oxfordshire - based Iranian writer who only gives her
Twitter name
Oxfordgirl was a prominent and much - followed source during the protests .
She insists that in some instances Twitter did help organise protests by warning demonstrators about the presence of security forces .
"" I 'm still getting information from people I know in Iran from Twitter , but it is not such an easy flow , "" she concedes .
Other forms of social media played a perhaps more important role than Twitter .
Victoria Grand , YouTube 's head of policy and communication , says that during the protests "" people were holding up their cameras as it were a sword in a way .
They really understood that if you can get the global community to see what 's happening that will be your greatest defence "" .
That may also be overstating the case given the violent suppression of the protests .
But even those wary of western exaggeration concede that sharing mobile phone footage was crucial . ""
YouTube was important , because so many people watched the videos …
It was living proof of what happened and it 's difficult to fake , despite what the Iranian government claimed , "" says Tehrani .
"" Without Iranian citizen media , people would never have seen Neda 's face , or other Iranians killed and beaten , or defying the security forces , "" he says , referring to Neda Soltan , the young woman whose death was broadcast on YouTube .
Annabelle Sreberny , professor in global media and communications at London 's School of Oriental and African Studies , agrees .
"" Twitter was massively overrated .
But spaces like YouTube and Facebook have been very important for sharing information . ""
But Sreberny , who is organising a conference next week on the role of non - conventional media in Iran , adds : "" I would n't argue that social media really mobilised Iranians themselves – the protest were best organised using SMS . ""
The importance of social media is perhaps best illustrated by the government 's response to it .
Many sites have been filtered or blocked in Iran , including YouTube and Facebook .
The speed of the internet was also deliberately slowed down .
And Prominent bloggers , like the former vice - president Mohammad Ali Abtahi , were among those first arrested .
More recently the so - called Iranian cyber army has attacked reformist websites , and the organisers have had their computer files deleted .
In the cat - and - mouse game between the regime and its opponents online , the government has gained the upper hand in the last few months .
"" Some of the best websites are now outside Iran , "" says Sreberny .
"" Many people have run away , so in that sense the ' mice ' are more spread . ""
The turning point was 11 February , when the opposition attempted to hijack the 31st anniversary celebrations of the 1979 revolution .
The event turned out to be a show of strength for the security forces and the government 's supporters .
As Tehrani says , "" People began to realise they should pay more attention to the reality on the ground and not become imprisoned by the visual bubble created online .
The cornerstone of this movement is not technology , it 's people . ""
Sreberny has a different explanation . ""
By February the demand for a recount had gone .
It was n't just that the regime had become more vicious , the opposition movement also needed a breathing space to work out what its key demands are , "" she says .
The next few days and weeks are seen as crucial to the opposition as it marks the anniversary of the election and Neda 's death .
Oxfordgirl says : "" The big test will be whether there 's a significant protest on the anniversary .
I do n't think there will be protest on the same scale as last year .
But in a way they do n't need to happen , because they were a catalyst that created a great deal of change within the regime . """
2010-06-09,"Iran 's economy is in serious trouble even without new UN sanctions — and western governments are hoping the new burdens being imposed on the Islamic republic will at least raise the cost of maintaining its nuclear programme .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has insisted Iran will not bow to pressure , but he is facing low or zero growth , rising unemployment , high inflation and , crucially , reduced earnings from the hugely dominant oil and gas sector , the source of 80 % of all state revenues .
Oil prices are down 16 % from this year 's peak , reducing the regime 's ability to buy support .
Iranian oil production has also declined , from 4.1 m barrels a day in 2008 , to a current rate of 3.5 m – a loss of 8 % a year .
Exports are also correspondingly down .
No one expects the economy to collapse but the sanctions are likely to have a psychological impact , not least because of the support of Russia and China , and cause problems for the regime , which is about to mark the first anniversary of the disputed presidential elections and the mass protests that followed .
Iranian statistics are notoriously unreliable but even official figures paint a grim picture : inflation is down to 9.8 % from a peak of 30 % during Ahmadinejad 's first presidency .
Last month , a speech by Ahmadinejad in the southern port of Khorramshahr was interrupted by unemployed demonstrators demanding jobs .
Of Iran 's 73 million people , more than 10 million live in "" absolute "" poverty and another 30 million in "" relative "" poverty , according to Iran 's statistics agency .
Locally produced milk in Mashhad is so expensive that a yoghurt plant imports powdered milk from New Zealand .
Industries are being hollowed out and workers laid off in the face of cheap foreign imports controlled by influential businessmen .
State employees have seen their purchasing power eroded by inflation .
The new sanctions do not directly target the energy sector — but ominously it is identified as a key source of financing for the nuclear programme .
Iran is already lagging far behind Qatar in exploiting the giant Pars gas field in the Gulf because of incompetence and inefficiency .
Joint ventures with France 's Total and Shell have stalled because of US signals discouraging investment in the energy sector .
Even Chinese state entities are wary .
Iran 's foreign currency reserves are also thought to have been badly depleted by the government 's decision to convert them from US dollars to euros .
Estimates vary on how much is held in euros , but the currency 's 16 % drop in value against the dollar this year has probably reduced Iran 's reserve holdings by $ 6bn-$12bn ( £ 4.1bn-£8.2bn ) .
Officials drawing up the sanctions have homed in on the enormous power of the Revolutionary Guards Corps , which is estimated to control up to 50 % of all economic activity .
Khatam al - Anbiya , an IRGC company , is now a key player in oil and gas projects – helped by the fact that the oil minister is a former Guards logistics chief .
The IRGC runs the nuclear programme and oversaw construction of a secret nuclear enrichment facility near the holy city of Qom .
The resolution calls for measures against new Iranian banks abroad if a connection to nuclear or missile programmes is suspected , as well as "" vigilance "" over transactions with any Iranian bank .
It expands a UN arms embargo and blacklists three firms controlled by Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and 15 belonging to the IRGC .
The resolution also calls for setting up a cargo inspection regime similar to one in place for North Korea .
Forty additional companies are to be blacklisted .
In the short term , Ahmadinejad 's biggest challenge is his long - delayed pledge to reform subsidies , ending the era of cheap petrol and domestic gas , and introducing cash payments in their place .
That is expected to bring a new spike in inflation and perhaps popular unrest . ""
The three rounds of economic sanctions already passed by the UN —as well as bilateral sanctions originating in the US and its western allies — have significantly increased Iran 's economic risks and held back growth , "" said IHS Global Insight .
The theory now is that rather than leading directly to a change of policy , the effect of the latest sanctions package will be to underline the cost of maintaining the nuclear programme .
The positive message is that compliance with international demands would mean a scramble for western investment — as experienced by Libya after it came in from the cold after giving up support for terrorism and closing down its nuclear programme in 2003 ."
2010-06-10,"Iran 's opposition leaders have called off plans for rallies to mark last year 's disputed presidential election to avoid clashing with the regime – a decision that will be widely seen as a serious setback for the pro - democracy Green movement .
Mir Hossein Mousavi , who claims he beat Mahmoud Ahmadinejad last June , and his fellow reformist candidate Mehdi Karroubi , announced that protests would not go ahead on Saturday "" in order to preserve people 's lives and property "" .
But they said the struggle against an "" illegitimate "" government would carry on .
The Islamic regime had been expected to flood the streets with huge numbers of security personnel and supporters to ensure that opposition protesters were intimidated and silenced .
The authorities had made clear that unrest would not be tolerated .
Five thousand people were arrested after last year 's mass demonstrations , suffering beatings , torture , abuse and an increase in politically motivated executions .
Several more have been reported in the past week .
Major - General Mohammad Ali Jafari , commander of the Revolutionary Guards , described the "" sedition "" of the opposition as more dangerous to Iran than the eight - year war with Saddam Hussein 's Iraq , in which hundreds of thousands died . ""
Because of the grace of God and the prophet - like guidance of the supreme leader and people 's vigilance , we put this bitter incident behind us and the enemies found out the revolution can not be diverted through these methods , "" Jafari was quoted as saying by official media .
Analysts agree the regime has regained control in a series of confrontations with an increasingly enfeebled opposition .
But Mousavi and Karroubi insisted that the reform movement had not been defeated and that Ahmadinejad 's government had no mandate .
The authorities were "" wrong to believe that with threats , humiliation , lies , and arms "" they "" can suppress the protest movement "" .
It was "" alive and the real pride belongs to those who are still continuing their rightful protest despite all threats , dangers , insecurities , and knowing well the … consequences , "" the two leaders said .
"" This is the tradition of an illegitimate government which does not give permission to hold rallies to anyone other than its supporters .
But the path which you , the great nation of Iran , have chosen can not be blocked .
We will stand by you until the bright morning of tomorrow , "" they said .
The government , meanwhile , continued to attack yesterday 's UN security council vote imposing a fourth round of sanctions on Iran to force it to comply with international demands to halt uranium enrichment .
Iran could revise its ties with the UN 's nuclear agency , one MP warned , while the media lashed out at western double standards on nuclear weapons .
But a video clip distributed by opposition supporters showed people in Tehran chanting "" death to the dictator "" and "" God is great "" to celebrate the blow to the regime .
Ahmadinejad dismissed the sanctions as "" used napkins that need to be thrown into the garbage can "" .
But in an early sign of their possible impact , Russia 's foreign ministry said it was freezing a contract to deliver S-300 air defence missiles to Tehran to comply with the sanctions , which ban exports of heavy weapons including missile systems .
Western diplomats said , however , that there were still conflicting signals from Moscow .
"" It 's a card they have n't yet played , "" said one official .
"" Why should they give it up ? ""
Russia agreed the deal several years ago but has never delivered the weapons in the face of pressure from the US and Israel , which both fear they would dramatically improve Iran 's air defence capabilities .
Neither has ruled out using force to attack Iranian nuclear sites .
EU governments are expected to agree further sanctions next month .
"" It is very important that we show the European Union is prepared on this subject and others to use its weight in the world , "" the British foreign minister William Hague said today during a visit to Berlin ."
2010-06-11,"Iran 's opposition Green movement , fighting for democracy since the disputed election a year ago , has not been crushed despite having to call off protests in the face of government repression , says a defiant Zahra Rahnavard , the wife of the defeated reformist candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi .
Rahnavard , a high - profile academic , sculptor and campaigner for women 's rights , says she is prepared to "" face the gallows "" in the struggle for freedom – but insists the movement her husband leads is reformist , not revolutionary , and wants to see respect for the Iranian constitution .
In an exclusive interview with the Guardian , her first for a British newspaper since mass unrest erupted last June , Rahnavard lambasts the Islamic regime for its "" Tiananmen - style "" attack on demonstrators protesting that their votes had been stolen by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
"" This movement started with the simple question : ' Where is my vote ? '
"" she said .
"" But because the response was violence and bullets and repression from the ruling regime , the situation entered another phase which was completely unpredictable .
People 's demands have changed so now there are more fundamental questions and more intensive criticism of the regime .
The Islamic republic has deviated from its path and goals .
"" We are still pursuing our ideals of 30 years ago [ the Islamic revolution of 1979 ] .
But the current government is the result of an electoral coup d'etat .
The Green movement has not been defeated at all .
It is going forward . ""
Rahnavard , 64 , said she opposed the sanctions passed this week by the UN security council against Iran enriching uranium that the west fears will be used to build nuclear weapons .
"" Sanctions are only harmful for the people of Iran , "" she warned .
"" The Iranian government is rich with oil money and the money is at its disposal .
Sanctions would not affect such a government . ""
The Greens appreciated the international sympathy they had attracted , she said , but the "" movement is not looking for the support of foreign governments at all and wants to stands on its own "" .
Rahnavard , a grandmother who wears colourful headscarves over her black chador , broke with tradition by campaigning with her husband – even holding hands with him in public – and quipped that Michelle Obama was "" America 's answer "" to her .
She poured scorn on Ahmadinejad after he attacked her in a TV debate by suggesting her academic qualifications were earned not on merit but through patronage and corruption .
Life under pressure from the regime and its supporters was not easy , Rahnavard said .
She had been beaten and sprayed with pepper gas , she said .
Mousavi 's bodyguard was arrested recently .
Harrassment , abuse and danger were constant .
Protests planned for tomorrow to mark the anniversary of the election have been called off because of fears of more violence by the security forces . ""
Each of us is able to function as a secretary , bodyguard , typist and adviser , "" she said .
"" We 've learned how to work in the time of dictatorship and repression and how to struggle for our goals .
Although we are not as free as before we still have our circle of friends who we meet often .
We write our own statements , type them ourselves and send them to people all over the world and we try hard to keep our dialogue with our own people alive . ""
Rahnavard said the Green movement was composed of many groups – women , teachers , workers and students .
"" They are all working with each other like the fingers of one hand .
The regime has not yet understood how well organised it is . ""
Rallies in solidarity with the Iranian people are planned in 83 cities across the world this weekend .
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both documented extensive repression , violence and abuses by the regime .
Britain and the US are expected to issue statements to mark the election 's anniversary , seeking to balance support for democracy with the need to avoid charges they want to undermine the regime .
Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , called it "" regrettable "" that protests in Iran had to be cancelled .
"" It demonstrates very clearly why the Iranian regime has caused so much concern throughout the world , "" she said .
"" We hope there will be a response from the Iranian government to their own people 's aspirations . ""
Robert Gates , the US defence secretary , warned that Iran could develop a nuclear weapon within one to three years but there was still time for the world to pressure Tehran .
"" I think that everybody agrees we have some more time , including the Israelis , and we will just continue to work it , "" Gates said in Brussels .
Iran 's ambassador to the UN 's nuclear watchdog insisted it would not stop enriching uranium because of the sanctions .
"" We will not , even for a second , suspend our nuclear enrichment activities , "" Ali Asghar Soltanieh told Reuters .
On another front , a senior MP in Tehran has warned Iran will start inspecting foreign vessels in the Gulf if Iranian ships receive such treatment under the new UN sanctions . ""
The Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf will be our field of manoeuvre in this regard and whoever harbours the intention of hurting or damaging us will be damaged severely in return , "" said Hossein Ibrahimi , deputy head of parliament 's national security and foreign policy commission ."
2010-06-11,"Six months ago Muhammed Hussein Torkaman was a young Revolutionary Guard in Iran , working in the security team attached to the supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
As part of this inner security force , the Sar - Allah , or Avengers of God , he was also responsible , he says , for the leaders ' personal safety during the protests after the presidential elections , which were widely viewed as having been stolen by Ahmadinejad .
He witnessed increasing dissent within the guards .
"" We have Revolutionary Guards who defied orders , though they were severely punished , expelled from the force and taken to prison , "" he says .
Torkaman , 24 , is in hiding in a small , nondescript flat in a backwater in central Turkey , where he is seeking asylum with his wife and two - year - old son .
His extraordinary account of the depravities of the Iranian government and its crushing of dissent forms the backbone of a film by Guardian Films and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism .
The film features the testimony of four former Revolutionary Guards , and reveals the extent of the disillusionment and division within the ranks .
Most significantly , perhaps , it provides evidence that sections of the Revolutionary Guard – a core part of the regime , which controls both the nuclear programme and huge swaths of the economy – are angry with the very leaders they have been traditionally prepared to die for .
Iran 's ban on foreign journalists makes it difficult to verify Torkaman 's claims of defections and resignations from the Revolutionary Guards in the face of the Iranian government 's "" reign of terror against its own people "" .
But his description of the brutal mechanics of the regime , and the impact of recent repression on the guards , fits with reports that have come out of the country since the election .
Torkaman admits playing a part in crushing the opposition in the aftermath of the contested election , but he says that he could no longer live with it and fled for Turkey in January .
"" I want people outside to know what is happening and what this regime is doing to them – this has to start from somewhere , "" he says .
Despite the regime 's description of the country as an Islamic republic , "" God does not exist in Iran right now "" .
Fearful for his safety , he believes Iranian intelligence is tracking his movements . ""
Please no filming outside the flat , "" he says .
"" It is too dangerous . ""
What Torkaman alleges about the levels of dissent within the guards raises questions about their loyalty to both the president and , perhaps more importantly , the supreme leader .
He says the doubts among the once - loyal foot soldiers have been exacerbated by the brutal way in which all forms of opposition have been attacked by an increasingly paranoid regime . ""
Because of my job every five days I would meet with high - ranking officials , like Mr Ahmadinejad and even his ministers .
These meetings were mostly with leaders ' security commanders .
But gradually the distance got less and less and we would meet with him everyday .
…
I could see the fear in them …
"" The fear and panic was quite evident in them , in their actions , their demeanour and various dismissals and appointments .
It was quite obvious , as they were appointing people to the powerful positions who are their supporters . ""
The scale of the danger posed by the so - called green rebels was underlined today when the leader of the Revolutionary Guards described the protests as a bigger threat to the republic than the 1980s war with Iraq .
Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari said : "" Although last year 's sedition did not last more than around eight months , it was much more dangerous than the imposed war which Saddam began against us . ""
According to Torkaman , the leadership was so worried that Khamenei and Ahmadinejad had a plane on standby , ready to fly them to Syria .
Khamenei is so paranoid , he says , that he has lost confidence in his own security team and has installed his own intelligence unit behind his office with bugging and surveillance equipment that allows his office to spy on their own spies .
He is also rumoured to change his bodyguards daily because of a fear of assassination .
The guard 's founding principles of defending the achievements of the 1979 Islamic Revolution have , says Torkaman , been "" betrayed "" by a regime that has carried out a brutal repression of the Iranian opposition , including the widespread use of public executions and extrajudicial killings , rape of both men and women , and a cover - up of the true numbers killed during the protests .
But although internal discord within the guards is growing , he says , this does not mean that the regime is about to be overthrown : "" Yes , there is a rift , but I have to add an explanation .
If there is any danger of the regime being overthrown then all the sectors will actually unite against that … because their existence depends on this regime .
"" As discord grows , the regime is said to be filling the guards ' ranks with thousands of young , pliant recruits from the countryside , whose loyalties are to the modern Iranian state rather than the ideals of the 1979 revolution .
A former guard , Major Mohamad Reza Madhi , who fled Iran two years ago , believes there is now a policy to purge older guards , those most likely to question the motives of the regime .
At a high security compound in Bangkok , Madhi tells Guardian Films that he is in constant communication with former colleagues , monitoring events via the internet .
He gasps for breath when he speaks – the result of five chemical weapons attacks during more than seven years in the trenches of the Iran - Iraq war . ""
If the veteran members of the Revolutionary Guard criticise the practices saying this is against Islam …
they are given early retirement or stopped from working , "" he says .
According to Mahdi , the new breed of recruits follow orders without question . ""
The majority … have no idea of right or wrong – what is legal what is not .
They bring these young men in … and they hand them weapons and these young people commit acts of murder .
"" It is no surprise that the guards find it easy to take on new recruits , because the corps has connections in all parts of Iran 's most important institutions .
Described as a "" conglomerate with guns "" , they have their own naval and missile units , while the al - Qods ( Jerusalem ) force combines the functions of an intelligence service , SAS - type special forces and an aid agency .
The guards ' holding companies and charitable foundations have a stake in construction , energy and telecommunications , and its control over Gulf ports and airport terminals allows it to move commodities without paying duty .
Madhi 's claims of division in the ranks are supported by the testimony of another former Revolutionary Guard , who worked for al - Qods , and who would speak to the Guardian only on the condition of anonymity .
He claims that small groups meet secretly – using the internet to maintain contact – to plan how to help the opposition .
He cites the increased levels and more brutal forms of torture as one of the reasons for turning against the government .
In his particular case , he says he was deeply affected by the hanging he witnessed of a pregnant woman .
"" Whatever crime she was guilty with , you can not hang her if she is pregnant .
This is against Islam .
Not acceptable , "" he says .
"" They kept her shivering in the air for like 15 minutes until she died .
She was bleeding in front of her children .
This regime will not last for long . ""
These descriptions match those of a former guard who was smuggled into Turkey three weeks ago .
Now in hiding , with his wife and child still in Iran , he was also only prepared to talk anonymously .
Going under the name Ali , he explains that he was arrested after refusing to beat protesters but was released after spending two months in prison when family members intervened .
"" My sisters and brothers - in - law are agents of the regime and among the senior officials of the Ministry of Intelligence , "" he says .
"" My wife managed to find out where I was through her brother
and then she bribed the commander of that district . ""
Ali describes the torture he was subjected to as routine for the regime .
"" The worst method … was the mock execution and I do n't think there is any torture more horrific than that .
They would convince us that this is the end of us .
"" They would put me on the electric chair and everything was ready .
They would tie my hands and feet , they would connect the cables , everything was done with the exception of pressing the button to apply the electric shock .
"" Special guards began to surround and attack me , my brother and a friend with pepper gas , baton , chains , knives – they moved us into a corner and that is how we became their captives . ""
Ali escaped capture , but his brother 's ID had been seized – and he knew Iranian forces would soon come searching for him .
"" I was in hiding until they put pressure on my wife and threatened that if I did not hand myself in , they would arrest her instead .
After a period of five or six months I do n't remember exactly , I was forced to return home . ""
Just half an hour after Ali returned to his house , security forces came to arrest him .
His head was put into a sack , before being bundled into the boot of a car and driven to a safe house where he was held for two months . ""
During the day my blindfolds were removed for a maximum of half an hour or less , it was a small place , it was tiled throughout , so it was easy to clean , because there was constantly bleeding and blood stains , they used to torture people there . ""
Ali describes in detail how he was tortured daily : "" I was kicked for three to four hours a day .
With a whip , cable , wooden stick .
One could constantly hear the shouting and the screams from other detainees .
"" Ali was subjected to a series of mock executions , which he describes as the worst kind of torture . "" Once it was by hanging another time it was by firing squad and another time by hanging us from the scaffold – all of these would be mock executions – to be honest there was no difference between a real execution and a mock execution .
The only difference was that I realised I could still breath .
In effect I was a walking dead . ""
Ali said the torturers showed little sign of remorse .
"" I could not see their faces , I could only hear their voices and suffer their torture .
I imagined that they were not even human . ""
You can not even call them animals since even animals follow certain discipline .
They did it with so much excitement
and I do n't know , I can not compare it to anything . ""
Ali fled to Turkey last month – since then he has not been able to contact his wife .
She was pregnant before he was arrested but suffered a miscarriage .
Ali believes it was a result of the interrogations and the beatings meted out by Iranian officers .
"" I consider the regime and its agents to be responsible for this .
I am prepared to give my life for this . ""

2010-06-16,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , hinted today that he may be ready to resume nuclear talks – but only after the west had been punished for imposing new sanctions .
Punitive measures targeting Iran 's Revolutionary Guard , companies and banks that were approved by the UN security council last week are to be followed by EU sanctions to be agreed tomorrow .
"" You showed bad temper , reneged on your promise and again resorted to devilish manners , "" Ahmadinejad said of the countries – 12 of the 15 members of the security council – that voted for the fourth set of sanctions in as many years .
"" We set conditions [ for talks ] so that , God willing , you 'll be punished a bit and sit at the negotiating table like a polite child , "" he told a crowd during a visit to the central Iranian town of Shahr - e - Kord .
"" We are ready to resume talks but we have conditions that will be announced soon .
We will not withdraw from our nuclear path even one iota because of sanctions . ""
Ahmadinejad claimed that the main purpose behind the latest UN sanctions was "" to rescue the Zionist regime from the heavy pressure of global public opinion "" – an apparent reference to Israel 's bloody interception of an aid flotilla trying to break the blockade of the Gaza Strip .
Iran 's foreign ministry summoned the British ambassador to Tehran to accuse the UK and other unnamed western countries of supporting an exiled "" terrorist "" group — a familiar charge at times of tension between the two countries .
The Iranian president also attacked Barack Obama for "" meddling in Iranian affairs "" by praising the courage of protesters on the anniversary of last year 's disputed Iranian election , which the opposition says was rigged by the regime .
During the speech , broadcast live on the Irinn state TV network , the sound faded away when Ahmadinejad paused to allow for the chanting of slogans , and came back when he resumed speaking .
This practice was also used after complaints about unemployment were heard during an address he gave in Khorramshahr last month .
The US and most of the west believe Iran is pursuing nuclear technology in order to produce weapons .
Tehran insists its programme is for peaceful purposes , attacking western double standards over nuclear disarmament and Israel and saying there should have been wider international support for a nuclear fuel swap deal it agreed with Brazil and Turkey last month .
Ali Larijani , speaker of the Iranian parliament , warned meanwhile that Iran would respond in a "" tough "" way if the US and other "" adventurous "" countries attempted to inspect Iranian ships and planes under the new UN sanctions regime . ""
This retaliation is part of defending our national interests , "" Larijani said amid chants of "" Death to America "" and "" Death to Israel "" .
MPs called on the government to continue enriching uranium to 20 % – a level that is seen by experts as going a significant way towards producing weapons - grade fissile material .
Iran 's chief nuclear official announced plans to build a new nuclear reactor for radioisotope production that is more powerful than its Tehran research facility .
Ali Akbar Salehi also said Iran would be also ready with its first batch of fuel plates for its existing research centre by September 2011 .
He added that Tehran wanted to commission "" several such reactors across the country so that we can produce radioisotopes for sale and export to the regional and Islamic countries that need them "" ."
2010-06-28,"Iran is to postpone nuclear talks with the west as a "" punishment "" for the imposition of new UN sanctions that are designed to it stop enriching uranium , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said today .
Negotiations would be put off until after Ramadan in late August , he said , though no talks have in fact been scheduled .
"" It 's a punishment to teach them a lesson to know how to have a dialogue with nations , "" he told reporters in Tehran .
Ahmadinejad also repeated that Iran would retaliate if attempts were made to inspect its ships , as sanctions permit .
Earlier , the Iranian leader had complained of a hidden agenda . ""
The western and US sanctions and threats are not only aimed at putting the brakes on Iran 's progress in nuclear technology , but come to keep Iran from becoming an economic and industrial power , "" he told a crowd in Natanz in Isfahan province .
Separately , Iran 's foreign ministry dismissed as "" psychological warfare "" an assessment by the CIA that the Islamic republic already has enough uranium to make two nuclear weapons .
Ramin Mehmanparast , the ministry spokesman , called the comments by Leon Panetta , the CIA chief , "" propaganda "" intended to allow the US to avoid nuclear disarmament .
"" What Iran is pursuing is only in the framework of the rights that its membership of the International Atomic Energy Agency entitles it to , "" Mehmanparast said .
"" The real concern is disarmament and non - proliferation . ""
Panetta said on ABC TV 's This Week on Sunday that Iran has amassed enough low - enriched uranium to produce two nuclear weapons within two years .
Earlier this month there was a similar assessment from the UN 's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Iran says its nuclear programme is for civilian power generation and has rebuffed demands by the UN security council that it suspend uranium enrichment .
On 9 June the council approved a fourth set of sanctions on Iran , while the US Congress last week approved new bilateral measures , as did the EU .
Panetta also said he believed the sanctions would "" probably not "" deter Iran from pursuing its nuclear ambitions and pointed to US disagreements with Israel over Iran 's intentions .
"" There is a continuing debate right now about whether or not they [ Iran ] ought to proceed with a bomb .
But they clearly are developing their nuclear capability and that raises concerns , "" Panetta said .
His comments brought an expression of concern from Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev . ""
Such information is always worrying and all the more so because the international community does not recognise the Iranian nuclear programme as transparent , "" he told reporters at the G20 summit . ""
If this is proved , it would make the situation even more tense .
"" Russia has in the past been reluctant to impose hard - hitting sanctions but backed the latest UN resolution following Tehran 's repeated defiance and clashed publicly with Iran over its change of tack .
Israel 's president , Shimon Peres , today expressed "" appreciation "" of Medvedev 's statement .
Reports from Dubai said that the UAE central bank has ordered financial institutions to freeze 41 Iran - linked accounts , in line with the UN sanctions .
UN resolution 1929 calls for measures against new Iranian banks abroad if a connection to the nuclear or missile programmes is suspected , as well as vigilance over transactions with any Iranian bank ."
2010-07-01,"Iran 's largest private university has become the focus of a bitter political battle for control between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his most powerful rival , Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani .
Mirroring intense factional conflicts since last year 's contested elections , rival factions are in a power struggle for Azad Islamic University in Tehran , which has hundreds of campuses across Iran and assets worth tens of billions of dollars .
The university , one of the world 's largest – with more than 1.5 million students and staff – is closely linked to Rafsanjani , a former president and self - described "" pragmatic conservative "" who is head of the powerful Assembly of Experts .
Rafsanjani was one of the founders of the university in 1982 .
Pro - regime critics have accused him of packing the university management with allies .
Ahmadinejad is thought to want to punish the university for allegedly supporting the opposition .
Mir Hossein Mousavi , the defeated opposition candidate in last year 's election , was on its board of trustees until he was ousted a month ago .
Control of universities is a priority for the regime , which is fearful of the way the opposition Green movement has become rooted in campuses .
But Sir Richard Dalton , an associate fellow at Chatham House and a former ambassador to Iran , said the struggle over Azad University was also about factional struggles in the regime .
"" It 's partly about the power struggle and partly about the cultural revolution .
Most of all , however , it is about the domestic power struggle between Ahmadinejad and Rafsanjani – another way of cutting Rafsanjani down .
Ahmadinejad and his supporters thought they had managed to push the reformists and the centrists out of the picture , but this year there appears to have been some kind of understanding between [ the supreme leader , Ayatollah ] Khamenei and Rafsanjani .
"" There is a recognition that Rafsanjani can not be completely removed .
That is why Ahmadinejad is trying to erode his position in society and politics , although Khamenei is refusing to play the game . ""
Since protests began , almost a third of those arrested have been students .
Last month Azad University students held two days of protests on the anniversary of the election .
On Sunday protesters at Tehran 's Arts University and Polytechnic University clashed with police after shouting "" death to the dictator "" and "" death to Khamenei "" .
At the centre of Azad University 's problems is its precise status .
Favoured by wealthier families whose children often do not have the exam grades to get into the more competitive public university system , the hugely wealthy institution raises fees like a private company .
But it has also in the past relied on the government when it needs its support and benefited too from grants of public lands .
The battle for control over Azad University began in earnest this year when Ahmadinejad imposed a new charter on it , aimed at pushing out its president , Abdullah Jasbi , a rightwing conservative but also an ally of Rafsanjani .
Pro -
Ahmadinejad media had accused the university and its management of "" officially supporting "" Mousavi and accused staff of helping to foment protests .
Last month , Ahmadinejad tried to persuade parliament to allow him to appoint the president and board .
The move was rejected by parliament , but 100 pro - regime MPs later joined forces to insist that the Supreme Council for Cultural Revolution had the final say , not parliament .
The issue will now be resolved by the powerful Guardian Council .
A spokesman for the supreme council , quoted by Iranian media outlets in the wake of the vote in parliament , continued to insist that the new charter imposed by Ahmadinejad was binding .
"" Articles of association of the Islamic Azad University have been communicated .
The university 's board of trustees should name the new president within the next month .
There is not much time , "" the SCCR 's secretary announced .
The struggle over the university 's future , not least in the Iranian parliament , has exposed the increasingly bitter divisions within Iran 's competing power structures , with pro - Ahmadinejad protesters from the Basij militia threatening to set fire to the parliament building because for its blocking of the president .
In reply , parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani called the response by regime loyalists "" vindictive "" .

2010-07-25,"Iran has told the EU it will "" regret "" imposing its toughest economic sanctions yet to force Tehran to halt uranium enrichment and return to negotiations about its nuclear programme .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's president , promised today that the Islamic republic would "" respond strongly to any threat "" hours before EU foreign ministers were to meet in Brussels to approve the sanctions .
EU officials and independent analysts have described the sanctions as the "" toughest ever "" against any country , going beyond what was agreed by the UN security council last month .
The measure that will alarm Iran is the EU 's ban on new investment , technical assistance and technology transfers to its gas and oil industry , particularly for refining and liquefied natural gas .
Iran is the world 's fourth largest producer of crude oil but imports 40 % of its fuel because it lacks sufficient refining capacity .
"" Anyone who adopts a measure against the Iranian nation … should know that Iran will react swiftly , "" Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying by Press TV , Iran 's English - language TV channel . ""
Experience shows such a reaction by the Iranian nation will cause you to regret it . ""
The EU is outpacing the UN by freezing the assets of dozens of more Iranian companies linked to the Revolutionary Guard , which runs the nuclear programme .
"" Economic mismanagement is the best ally of those who are trying to change Iranian behaviour , "" said a British diplomat .
"" In some areas , these sanctions will be close to crippling . ""
The sanctions also target Iran 's transportation , banking and insurance sectors .
Details of the assets freeze are being kept confidential until Tuesday to avoid pre - emptive counter - measures .
Banks in all 27 EU countrieswill have to exercise "" enhanced vigilance "" over financial transactions linked to Iran .
Transfers of more than € 10,000 ( £ 8,400 ) must be notified and transfers of more than € 40,000 will require authorisation .
Manouchehr Mottaki , Iran 's foreign minister , previously warned of "" dire consequences "" for EU - Iranian relations if new sanctions were imposed to supplement the fourth package agreed by the UN security council in early June .
Australia , Canada , Japan and India would be encouraged to follow suit , officials said .
The US and EU wanted to impose their own bilateral penalties because the UN measures were limited by what Russia and China were prepared to support .
Iran insists its nuclear programme is peaceful .
Its critics suspect its goal is to build nuclear weapons .
Ali Larijani , the speaker of the parliament meanwhile lashed out at the west over its attitude to Israel which , unlike Iran , is not a signatory to the nuclear non - proliferation treaty . ""
All member states of the P5 + 1 - Russia , China , Britain , France , the US plus Germany – know that the Zionist regime has more than 200 nuclear warheads but keep silent about it , "" Larijani said .
"" The US , European states , Russia and China know that Iran does not have nuclear weapons .
Islamic ideology is against the possession of weapons of mass destruction and the Leader of the Islamic Revolution has issued a decree prohibiting such weapons . ""
Iranian media reported over the weekend that the country was planning to build an experimental nuclear fusion reactor - the first mention in years that such work was continuing .
The EU 's foreign policy chief , Lady Ashton , has asked Iran to resume talks but has received no response .
Mottaki told his Turkish counterpart Ahmet Davutoglu on Sunday that negotiations could be held after Ramadan in mid - September ."
2010-07-28,"Iran president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad says media sensation and front - cover star Paul the octopus – as if he needs an introduction – spreads "" western propaganda and superstition "" , according to the Daily Mail .
He said that Paul represents decadence and decay among Iran 's enemies .
"" Those who believe in this type of thing can not be leaders of the global nations that aspire , like Iran , to human perfection . ""
Paul was unavailable for comment ."
2010-08-04,"Reports of an assassination attempt on the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , were denied by the Tehran regime today , which said the confusion stemmed from a firecracker being mistakenly described as a "" grenade "" .
The Iranian website khabaronline.ir said a homemade grenade exploded near Ahmadinejad 's presidential motorcade in Hamedan , western Iran , as he was on his way to address a crowd .
But the official Islamic Republic News Agency ( IRNA ) reported that a local youth had thrown a firecracker as "" a sign of joy "" and blamed the use of the words "" homemade grenade "" for the confusion .
It quoted the governor of Hamedan saying : "" No one has been injured and no damage has been made . ""
However , Mehr news agency said that a number of people had been arrested at the scene .
In Iran a homemade grenade often refers to a type of firecracker used to celebrate Chaharshanbe Suri , Iran 's festival of fire , on the last Wednesday of the Persian year .
The Iranian regime sees the celebration as un - Islamic and banned the sale of firecrackers in the country , resulting in many people making their own devices at home .
The homemade grenades are not made to kill , although they are more dangerous than firecrackers and can cause death .
Their use during a presidential visit would be highly unusual because of security concerns .
All the reports said that the president was unhurt and he went on to give his speech as planned , which was broadcast live on state television .
He made no mention of the incident during his speech .
The semi - official Fars News Agency initially said a "" homemade grenade "" was thrown but changed the report within a few minutes , referring to a "" homemade firecracker "" it said was thrown as a "" sign of joy "" .
The report on khabaronline.ir said the president 's car was about 100 metres from the apparent blast .
Heydar Moslehi , Iran 's intelligence minster , was quoted by the Iranian Students News Agency ( ISNA ) after the incident saying : "" We have discovered some conspiracy plots backed by Israelis in the region . ""
However , his comments did not directly relate to events in Hamedan .
Reporting the president 's speech , IRNA said he had expressed an interest "" in dialogue [ with the west ] based on justice and mutual respect "" .
He criticised the imposition of sanctions on Iran but said he was prepared to meet Barack Obama on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in September , according to the report .
Ahmadinejad has become a pariah figure in the west since rising to power in 2005 .
He has thrived on confrontation , with frequent fiery rhetoric aimed at Israel , the US and their allies .
Of most concern to the west is Iran 's nuclear programme , which the west believes is being used to develop weapons of mass destruction despite Iran 's insistence that it is for peaceful ends .
Israel is believed to be prepared to strike against Iran 's nuclear facility if its fears about Iran developing nuclear weapons can not be allayed .
Ahmadinejad , who has denied the Holocaust in the past , claimed earlier this week that "" Zionists "" were threatening to kill him ."
2010-08-04,"Tehran is struggling to play down reports of an alleged bomb attack on President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad – which raced around the world – as it appeared an error in translation may have transformed a firecracker into a grenade .
The security alert was triggered in the city of Hamedan , where the hardliner had arrived to make a speech .
As he drove from the airport to the city 's football stadium a teenager threw a large cherry bomb at a minibus carrying journalists at the back of Ahmadinejad 's convoy .
The teenager was subsequently arrested .
The firecrackers – which are popular at the Iranian new year festival Norouz and at football matches — are known as "" narenjaks "" , the same word used for a grenade .
Despite immediate claims that Ahmadinejad had survived an attempt to murder him , one local journalist present when the incident occurred , told the Washington Post anonymously that the incident was a minor one . ""
On the path between the airport and stadium , while the convoy was crowded with people , there was suddenly a relatively loud sound , and some smoke , "" said the journalist .
"" It did not even warrant Ahmadinejad 's security team to act . ""
The initial claim of an attack , which appeared at first to be supported by an unnamed government source quoted by Reuters , was denied quickly by officials in Ahmadinejad 's office .
The story first emerged on a number of Iranian websites , including khabaronline.ir – a site linked to the speaker of the Iranian parliament Ali Larijani .
Different versions of the incident followed throughout the day with the semi - official Fars news agency saying a handmade grenade was thrown where the president and his entourage had been – but only after they had left the site .
The government - owned Borna news agency said somebody threw a firecracker after the convoy had passed , while the semi - official Mehr news agency called it a handmade percussion grenade .
A photo by the semi - official ISNA news agency showed smoke dozens of yards away from the convoy , which was surrounded by people .
In Iran "" a homemade grenade "" - as it was described in some original reports - often refers to a type of firework used to celebrate Chaharshanbe Suri , Iran 's festival of fire on the last Tuesday of the Persian calendar , which generates a lot of noise and smoke .
The Iranian regime sees the celebration as un - Islamic and banned the sale of firecrackers in the country , resulting in many people making their own devices .
The homemade grenades are not made to kill , although they are more dangerous than firecrackers and can cause death and serious injuries .
Their use during a presidential visit would be highly unusual because of security concerns .
The incident generated global interest , coming barely a day after Ahmadinejad had said in a speech that "" Zionist agents "" were plotting to kill him .
Ahmadinejad went on to give his speech as planned , and it was broadcast live on state television .
He made no mention of the attack , focusing instead on the country 's disputed nuclear program ."
2010-08-07,"The harrowing case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani – a mother of two sentenced to stoning by an Iranian court for adultery – has rightly drawn the world 's attention to Iran 's draconian penal code , which reserves its cruellest punishments for women .
The practice of stoning , in particular , is so abhorrent that even political allies like Brazil have been roused into action .
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva offered Ashtiani asylum over the weekend in a direct appeal to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Iran has yet to respond formally , and a foreign leader can have no direct bearing on a domestic legal proceeding .
But the Brazilian intervention sends a powerful message to the Islamic Republic : its human rights record can never be divorced from its nuclear diplomacy .
Before the 1979 Islamic revolution , back in the years when I worked as a judge in Iran , consensual sexual relations between adults did not figure in the country 's criminal code .
The revolution enacted a version of Islamic law which is extraordinarily harsh even by the standards of the Islamic world , making extra - marital sex a crime punishable by law .
Under its penal code , the punishment for a single man or woman guilty of sex outside marriage became 100 lashes ; under Article 86 , the punishment for a married person became death by stoning .
On the face of things , stoning is not a gendered punishment , for the law stipulates that adulterous men face the same brutal end .
But because Iranian law permits polygamy , it effectively offers men an escape route : they are able to claim that their adulterous relationship was in fact a temporary marriage ( Iranian law recognises "" marriages "" of even a few hours duration between men and single women ) .
Men typically exploit this escape clause , and are rarely sentenced to stoning .
But married woman accused of adultery have access to no such reprieve .
The barbarity of stoning aside , Iran 's legal codes are studded with inconsistencies and vagaries that make due process virtually impossible .
The penal code notes that if a man or woman is denied sexual access to a spouse due to travel or other prolonged separation , 100 lashes suffice as punishment for adultery , but it does not specify the duration of acceptable separation .
Stoning can also be reduced to lashes when a married woman has sex with a minor ( Iranian law considers the age of maturation for girls nine , and for boys 15 ) .
In real terms , this means that a married woman who commits adultery with a 40-year - old man must be sentenced to stoning , but if she commits the same act with a 15-year - old – effectively taking sexual advantage of a minor – she is accorded a legal break .
Criminal prosecution for adultery , and the handing down of a stoning verdict , does not even require a personal plaintiff ; if it can be proven that a man or woman has committed adultery , even if the betrayed spouse offers his or her forgiveness , the transgressor must be stoned .
Article 105 of the penal code enables a judge to sentence an adulterer to stoning based purely on his "" knowledge "" ; as such , it is possible for a judge to sentence a woman simply based on her husband 's complaint .
These glaring lapses are only the most obvious reason why Iran must reconsider the practice , which most Islamic countries long ago discarded in their efforts to harmonise Islam with modern norms .
Stoning has long been criticised by a number of Islamic jurists , most notably the Ayatollah Yousef Saanei .
These jurists believe that such punishment was meted out in the early days of Islam 's seventh century advent in the desert of Saudi Arabia , in accordance with the customs of the time .
They note that the Koran makes no mention of stoning , and believe that lighter punishments , such as imprisonment or fine , can be considered .
Lawyers , human rights defenders , and jurists have condemned the practice of stoning ever since it entered Iran 's criminal justice system .
Unfortunately , Iran has been indifferent .
Perhaps now , facing the chastisement of a powerful ally like Brazil , Tehran will be forced to consider whether its adherence to such practices ultimately serves its national interests .
To avoid international outcry , the government refrains from announcing stoning verdicts publicly .
It is only slowly and by word of mouth , through information relayed by families and lawyers , that cases make their way to the media .
As such , we can not even know precisely how many Iranians have been killed by such punishment in the past three decades .
A year and a half ago , the Iranian media reported that a man was executed in the city of Qazvin by stoning .
Now Ashtiani faces a similar fate – and perhaps others , too ."
2010-08-11,"Mehdi Karroubi , a former speaker of the Iranian parliament under the reformist president Mohammad Khatami , came fourth in last summer 's election , in which Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was re - elected president after a disputed vote .
Known for his directness , the 73-year - old infuriated hardliners by alleging that male and female protesters were raped by their jailers in the crackdown on mass protests after the election .
When one hardline cleric called for Karroubi to be prosecuted for making the claim , he went further , saying some detainees had been tortured to death and comparing the treatment of prisoners with that at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq .
Born in 1937 in Aligoudarz , a town in western Lorestan province , in south - west Iran , Kerroubi has been a fixture in Iranian politics since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
His father was a cleric , and he studied theology in Qom before becoming a supporter of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the early 1960s .
After Khomeini was arrested in 1963 and sent into exile , Karroubi was active in distributing Khomeini 's open letters to government officials and spreading his teachings to the people .
Between 1963 and 1977 , Karroubi was arrested several times and spent years in jail , including stints at the notorious Qasr and Evin prisons in Tehran .
During the protests against the Shah in 1978 and 79 , Karroubi was in charge of the local committees that distributed food to protesters and strikers .
After the Shah 's overthrow , Karroubi was elected to the Iranian parliament .
During last year 's election , he won the support of many young voters for his willingess to challenge the status quo , speaking openly about the need to revise the constitution to make it more democratic .
The most vociferous opposition figure since the 2009 election , Karroubi has dismissed Ahmadinejad 's government as illegitimate and illegal , and has attacked state media for their one - sided coverage of political developments .
Karroubi 's wife , Fatemeh , comes from a wealthy family from Aligoudarz .
She has been a social activist herself , involved in women 's issues .
They have four children , all boys ."
2010-08-11,"Punitive international sanctions imposed on Iran have strengthened Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's government and assisted its post - election crackdown on the opposition Green movement , the leading reformist politician and former presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi has told the Guardian .
In his first interview with a British newspaper since widespread unrest erupted after Ahmadinejad 's disputed re - election as president last June , Karroubi blamed the US and Britain for adopting counterproductive policies to combat Iran 's suspect nuclear programme , describing sanctions as a gift to the Iranian regime . ""
These sanctions have given an excuse to the Iranian government to suppress the opposition by blaming them for the unstable situation of the country , "" Karroubi said in email responses to the Guardian .
Karroubi , 73 , a former speaker of the Majlis , the Iranian parliament , under the reformist president Mohammad Khatami , and a candidate in last year 's election , said that isolating Iran would not bring democracy . ""
Look at Cuba and North Korea , "" he said .
"" Have sanctions brought democracy to their people ?
They have just made them more isolated and given them the opportunity to crack down on their opposition without bothering themselves about the international attention . ""
The UN security council agreed a new round of sanctions on Iran in June after the US and Britain , which believe Iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons , obtained backing from Russia and China .
The EU , and individual countries such as the US and Britain , subsequently imposed additional punitive measures .
The move followed Washington 's rejection of a proposed deal , brokered by Brazil and Turkey , under which Iran would have handed over nearly half of its stock of low - enriched uranium in return for "" safe "" nuclear fuel supplies that could not be used in bomb - making .
Turkey and Brazil voted against the new UN sanctions , but today Brazil announced that it was reluctantly prepared to enforce them .
Mir Hossein Mousavi , who helped lead the protests following last summer 's election , co - authored a public letter with Karroubi last week in which they condemned the sanctions while blaming Ahmadinejad 's government for mishandling negotiations over Iran 's nuclear programme .
"" Sanctions have targeted the most vulnerable social classes of Iran including workers and farmers , "" the letter said .
Karroubi told the Guardian : "" On the one hand , the government 's mishandling of the economy has resulted in deep recession and rising inflation inside the country , which has crippled the people of Iran and resulted in the closure of numerous factories .
On the other hand , we have sanctions which are strengthening the illegitimate government . ""
Karroubi , who was imprisoned before the Islamic revolution in 1979,said that despite widespread corruption , the shah 's regime treated its opponents less harshly than the current government , partly because the shah was sensitive to international criticism . ""
But because Iran is getting more isolated , more and more they [ Ahmadinejad 's government ] are becoming indifferent to what the world is thinking about them , "" he said .
Last summer 's unrest resulted in the killing , beating or arrest of hundreds of protesters who took to the streets convinced that Ahmadinejad , who is backed by Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , had stolen the election .
Hopes the regime would call a fresh vote or collapse under public anger dissipated in clouds of teargas , counter - demonstrations organised by the government , and often brutal repression .
Since then , Iranians have suffered a crackdown on dissent and an increase in human rights abuses .
Yesterday the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , issued an appeal to Iran to honour its international treaty obligations to respect the rights of its citizens .
She also expressed concern about the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani , who was sentenced to death by stoning after being found guilty of adultery .
In his interview with the Guardian , Karroubi condemned Ashtiani 's sentence and said he was opposed to stoning in principle .
Karroubi said that since the election his office has been sealed off and his newspaper , Etemad - e - Melli ( the National Trust ) , closed down while he was under informal house arrest .
Wherever he went , he said , groups of government supporters , sometimes accompanied by plainclothes basiji militiamen , followed him .
"" In the last year , they [ officials ] have tried to suppress me in many ways , "" he said .
"" Once I was physically attacked , on the anniversary of the Islamic revolution , and my son Ali was arrested and severely tortured .
During a recent visit I had to Qazvin province , they went further in attacking me and opened fire on my car and later raided my house . ""
Ayatollah Khamenei has never attacked him or Mousavi by name , but always referred to them as "" leaders of sedition "" , a term now now routinely used to describe opposition leaders .
Last month , during a visit to Qom , Karroubi was met by government supporters shouting "" western stooge "" .
Despite having to call off protests in the face of the government crackdown , Karroubi said he believed the Green movement had not been defeated .
"" It 's no longer possible for the opposition movement to pour out en masse into the streets …
But we also do not think it 's necessary any more to do this , "" he said .
The movement 's message had already reached the world , he said .
"" People were out in the streets to inform the world of what is really happening inside Iran , and they succeeded in doing so .
Now the world knows what is the problem in Iran . ""
Karroubi said he still believed in the Islamic republic , but not the current ruling system .
"" I should make it clear that we are a reformist movement , not a revolutionary one …
We are seeking nothing more than a free election . ""
Asked about criticism that the opposition has no clear leader and sometimes appeared divided , Karroubi said : "" In my opinion , it 's an advantage that no specific person is the leader .
I think that the only reason the Green movement has not been stopped yet is because it does n't have one leader or unified leadership .
If it had , then by arresting that leader they could have controlled the whole movement . ""
Reaching out to Iran 's ordinary people remained the opposition 's biggest problem : any newspaper that mentioned the Green movement would be immediately closed down , he said .
"" We are not even allowed to publish a funeral announcement at the moment . """

That fearless defender of the truth George Galloway secured something of a scoop with a 25-minute interview with Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , in Tehran this week , during which the normally garrulous ex - MP managed to fire off a total of seven hard - hitting questions , none of them quite ranking for toughness with "" What 's your favourite colour ? "" .
The interview , from Galloway 's The Real Deal programme on state - sponsored Iranian Press TV , is now up on YouTube and contains relentless probing of whether Iranian flexibility can defuse nuclear tensions , robust questioning about "" Netanyahu 's gang "" in Israel , and a poser on Iran 's post - election opposition – "" What does the Green movement mean to you ? ""
– eliciting an eight - minute answer .
During this Galloway shockingly divulged that he needs police protection in London to save him from Iranian opponents of the regime , after being attacked by two of them "" in the parliament building "" .
The BBC could learn from his interrogative technique ; and probably would if it was n't barred from Iran .
Most startling was Galloway 's question about the woman threatened with stoning for adultery –
"" an issue seized upon by the enemies of Iran and magnified "" .
Strangely , this translated once Galloway was safely back in the studio into "" an ever more infamous case "" .
Surely George does n't ask a craven question to "" his excellency "" face to face , and then say something more harsh afterwards ?
That would n't be like him , would it ?

2010-08-22,"Iran has unveiled an unmanned , long - distance bomber drone described by the country 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , as "" an ambassador of death "" to Tehran 's enemies .
At a ceremony today , Ahmadinejad said the unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV ) – named Karrar , meaning "" striker "" in Persian – had "" a main message of peace and friendship "" but was intended to deter aggression "" and keep the enemy paralysed in his bases "" .
The presentation came as technicians began fuelling the Islamic republic 's first nuclear power station , at Bushehr , in a development Israel has described as "" totally unacceptable "" .
The US and Britain say the Bushehr plant , which is monitored by the UN 's nuclear watchdog , poses no proliferation threat because Russia is supplying the nuclear fuel and will remove the spent fuel rods , minimising any risk that they could be used to make nuclear weapons .
Iran is under UN sanctions to force a halt to uranium enrichment because of fears that it secretly plans to build nuclear weapons .
It flatly denies having any such intention .
Ahmed Vahidi , the Iranian defence minister , said the Karrar had a range of up to 620 miles , which is not far enough to reach Israel .
Iranian state TV reported that the UAV could carry four cruise missiles , two 250 lb bombs or one 500 lb bomb .
The drone was the latest item of military hardware to be inaugurated by Iran against a background of continuing tension over the nuclear issue .
On Friday , Tehran test - fired a new surface - to - surface missile called the Qiam ( meaning "" rising "" ) .
It has already developed long - range missiles capable of hitting Israel and eastern Europe and of carrying a nuclear warhead .
Earlier this month , the Debka file website , which appears to have links to Israeli intelligence , reported that the father of Iran 's UAV programme , Reza Baruni , had been assassinated in a bomb attack in his home town of Ahwaz , in Khuzestan .
There has been no confirmation of this unattributed claim from any other source .
It is widely believed that western intelligence services , Israel and perhaps Arab countries have been seeking to sabotage the Iranian nuclear programme .
Experts say the programme appears to have suffered setbacks .
The Iranian media has previously reported the successful test of a radar - evading "" stealth "" drone with bombing capabilities .
In March 2009 , US fighter jets in Iraq shot down an unmanned Iranian spy drone , generating concern in Washington .
Yesterday , Ahmadinejad warned that any attack against Iran would be "" suicidal "" .
Still , the threat of pre - emptive military action that could ignite war across the Middle East may be receding .
Obama administration officials were reported last week to have told Israel they believe Iran is still a year away from being able to build a nuclear weapon .
The New York Times quoted Israeli officials as saying that their assessments were coming into line with Washington 's view , but they remain suspicious that Iran has a secret uranium enrichment site yet to be discovered – after one was revealed in a mountainside near Qom last September as sanctions moves intensified .
Israel , an undeclared atomic power which , unlike Iran , has not signed the nuclear non - proliferation treaty ( NPT ) , has often warned that it can not live with a nuclear - armed Iran and hinted that it may attack it , as it did Iraq 's nuclear reactor in 1981 .
Iran has repeatedly declared a willingness to return to nuclear talks with the EU , but the exact nature of any negotiations has yet to be defined .
Nothing has happened since October .
Ahmadinejad was quoted in a Japanese newspaper on Friday as saying Iran would be prepared to stop higher - grade uranium enrichment if it was guaranteed nuclear fuel supplies for a research reactor .
But the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – who makes all key national security decisions – said last week that Iran would not talk to the US unless sanctions and military threats were lifted ."
2010-09-02,"A group of Iranian journalists sympathetic to the world view of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has launched barackobama.ir , a website set up to address "" an Iranian viewpoint on Barack Obama 's opinions "" .
The news of its creation first appeared this week in a series of government - sponsored websites and news agencies , which endorsed it as an independent source of information about the life of Obama , his administration and issues such as 9/11 , Israel and Iran 's nuclear programme .
The website has attracted nearly 100,000 visitors in its first week .
It introduces itself as a group "" that believes that Barack Obama is n't only a name but a political phenomenon "" .
It depicts the American president as someone "" who insists on the Arabic - Islamic part of his name : Hussein "" and adds : "" He is educated , lawyer , friendly , who observes the niceties of etiquette showing real oriental feeling in his innocent eyes that are the heritage of the occidental government 's cruelty to the Negroes . ""
But it adds that , by electing him as president , "" the United States confessed to the increasing power of Islam "" .
Among articles published on his life is one headlined : "" Is he the first Jewish president ? ""
Ahmadinejad sees the internet as a platform used for "" psychological war against Iran "" and has repeatedly asked its supporters to attack the "" enemies "" in the virtual society .
Since the disputed presidential election last summer , when Iranian protesters exploited Twitter and Facebook to spread their voice , the number of government - supported websites and blogs has increased significantly , while access to almost all opposition websites has been blocked .
An Iranian journalist who asked not to be identified said : "" In Iran , all blogs and websites need to register with the government , especially those holding .ir domains , and the fact that barackobama.ir is set up without problem and is welcomed by governmental news agencies shows that it is backed by officials within the Iranian regime . """
2010-09-03,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , today launched an angry attack on "" doomed "" US - brokered Middle East peace talks and urged the Palestinians to continue armed resistance to Israel .
Ahmadinejad used the annual al - Quds ( Jerusalem ) Day rally in Tehran to scorn the Obama administration 's efforts in launching the first Arab - Israeli negotiations in nearly two years .
"" What do they want to negotiate about ?
Who are they representing ?
What are they going to talk about ? ""
the hardline Iranian leader said of the Palestinian negotiating team in Washington .
"" Who gave them the right to sell a piece of Palestinian land ?
The people of Palestine and the people of the region will not allow them to sell even an inch of Palestinian soil to the enemy .
The negotiations are stillborn and doomed .
"" Iran supports Hamas , the Islamist Palestinian movement that controls the Gaza Strip and opposes talks by Mahmoud Abbas , the western - backed PLO leader who is based in the West Bank .
Its armed wing claimed responsibility for killing four Israeli settlers near Hebron on Tuesday .
Hamas , Islamic Jihad and other groups have vowed to carry out more attacks .
"" The fate of Palestine is determined in Palestine and through the resistance of the Palestinian people , rather than in Washington , Paris and London , "" Ahmadinejad said in his live TV broadcast .
Iran 's al - Quds Day event was founded in 1979 to mark the solidarity of the Islamic revolution with the Palestinians , and is held on the last Friday of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan .
Iranian state media reported that millions of people turned out in Tehran and elsewhere for al - Quds rallies .
But the regime took pre - emptive measures to silence opposition supporters who have managed to exploit previous official holidays to show their defiance .
The few foreign journalists based in Iran operate under severe restrictions .
Mehdi Karroubi , one of the two reformist candidates defeated by Ahmadinejad in last summer 's presidential race , was prevented from joining the Tehran rally .
Karroubi 's website reported that Revolutionary Guardsmen and basij militiamen had surrounded his home while supporters of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader , smashed windows and beat up one of his guards .
Mir - Hossein Mousavi , leader of the defeated Green movement – who claims his victory was "" stolen "" by Ahmadinejad – condemned the attack .
He said it proved the government 's "" enmity against Israel is an excuse "" for attacking opposition leaders . ""
Karroubi and figures like him and other freedom - seekers are the real enemies of authoritarians , "" he said .
Iran 's opposition has not managed to hold any big demonstrations in recent months .
Last February , it cancelled plans for a rally on the anniversary of the 1979 revolution .
Since the election , the authorities have detained thousands and tried scores on charges of fomenting unrest , with more than 80 sentenced to prison and 10 to death .
The chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces , Hassan Firouzabadi , warned meanwhile that Iran would retaliate against Israel 's nuclear facility if Israel attacked its nuclear activities .
"" Our developed weapons can hit any part of the Zionist regime [ Israel ] ...
We hope not to be forced to attack their nuclear facility , "" Firouzabadi told the semi - official Mehr news agency .
Iran denies it intends to build nuclear weapons but is under UN sanctions to force it to stop enriching uranium ."
2010-09-08,"Fidel Castro has accused Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , of antisemitism , in a passionate defence of Israel 's right to exist .
Cuba 's retired president , a longtime critic of Israeli government policy , said Jews had been slandered and slaughtered for centuries whereas Muslims were not blamed for anything .
The 83-year - old comandante criticised Ahmadinejad for denying the Holocaust and urged Tehran to acknowledge the "" unique "" history of antisemitism and understand why Israelis feared for their existence .
The comments will sting Iran 's president and could prove awkward for Venezuela 's Hugo Chávez and Brazil 's Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , two presidents who revere Castro and have forged close ties with Ahmadinejad .
Castro made his comments to Jeffrey Goldberg , a journalist with The Atlantic , whom he summoned to Havana after reading one of his articles about the Middle East .
Goldberg brought Julia Sweig , a Cuba expert at the Council on Foreign Relations , and the two talked with Castro over three days last month .
The journalist 's blog on the encounters , posted today , revealed the first details of the encounter .
http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/09/fidel-to-ahmadinejad-stop-slandering-the-jews/62566/
In recent months Castro has repeatedly warned that the US and Israel were edging the world towards a nuclear catastrophe in their confrontation with Iran .
But he surprised his visitors by dwelling on the historic injustices suffered by Jews .
Iran , he said , should understand the Jews were expelled from their land and mistreated all over the world as the ones who killed God . ""
The Jews have lived an existence that is much harder than ours .
There is nothing that compares to the Holocaust . ""
Castro continued : "" I do n't think anyone has been slandered more than the Jews .
I would say much more than the Muslims .
They have been slandered much more than the Muslims because they are blamed and slandered for everything .
No one blames the Muslims for anything . ""
Asked what he would tell Ahmadinejad face to face , Castro replied : "" I am saying this so you can communicate it.""He reminisced about being a young boy and overhearing classmates saying Jews killed Jesus Christ .
"" I did n't know what a Jew was .
I knew of a bird that was a called a ' Jew , ' and so for me the Jews were those birds .
This is how ignorant the entire population was . ""
The Cuban said nuclear powers , including Israel , should disarm and that he understood Iranian fears of Israeli - American aggression .
"" Iranians are not going to back down in the face of threats .
That 's my opinion . ""
Goldberg said Castro 's body was frail but his mind was acute and energy levels high . ""
And not only that : the late - stage Fidel Castro turns out to possess something of a self - deprecating sense of humour .
When I asked him , over lunch , to answer what I 've come to think of as the Christopher Hitchens question – has your illness caused you to change your mind about the existence of God ?
– he answered , ' Sorry , I 'm still a dialectical materialist . '
"" Goldberg also asked Castro what he now thought about his recommendation to the Soviet Union to bomb the US during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis . ""
After I 've seen what I 've seen , and knowing what I know now , it was n't worth it all . """
2010-09-12,"In the west , it is easy to assume that Iran is an isolationist regime , cut off from mainstream international thought and acting regardless of international pressure .
However , this neglects the extreme lengths Iran goes to in order to portray itself as a defiant power .
Last year Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was the only head of state to attend the Geneva anti - racism conference .
The sole reason for his presence was to stir up controversy and to be seen as taking a stand against the might of the west .
Iran does not act regardless of international opinion ; it deliberately acts with it in mind .
This rhetoric of defiance serves the Iranian regime by providing a common enemy which helps garner domestic support .
But more than anything , Iran 's defiance gives it the image of a player on the world stage .
This is what Iran really craves , not because of any tangible benefits such as trade agreements but more simply because of vanity .
Iranians believe that Iran should be a world leader given the country 's rich culture , resources and heritage .
The aspiration is to return Iran to the ancient prestige it attained under the Persian empire .
Despite its monarchist foundations , the idea has certainly continued in the current regime .
But defiance is just not cutting it .
If Iran was content with its place on the world stage then it would simply dismiss western concerns about Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani 's stoning .
Instead , it postpones her sentence and commutes those of several others .
Iran seeks to appease the west .
This leaves Iran with a split personality of appeasement and defiance .
It 's a headache for the Iranian establishment and leaves the country particularly sensitive to foreign pressure .
Iran can be pushed one way or another .
Any foreign pressure which is applied should be extremely cautious not to provoke a reactionary response from Iran which drives it deeper into the psyche of defiance .
Such an error is evident in the nuclear issue .
Iran feels that it has been unfairly targeted by the west .
This was abundantly clear in May when Tehran hosted a nuclear disarmament meeting .
Ahmadinejad lambasted US safeguarding of Israel 's nuclear arsenal while depriving countries like Iran of peaceful nuclear power .
Iran sees international pressure as an attack on its independence and technological capability .
It adopts a defiant psyche because appeasement would show it to be subordinate to the west .
Iran 's aspirations as a world leader are better served by acting defiant .
Diplomatic relations and negotiations with Iran would be much more successful if the west appealed to Iran 's vanity .
This would involve a large amount of flattery .
Iran would have to be treated as an equal .
This would immediately solve Iran 's dilemma of whether to defy or appease because there would be no opportunity to defy .
Iran would n't be defying anybody by pulling out of mutual negotiations because no one was forcing them to negotiate in the first place .
This approach even compels Iran to actively seek and maintain negotiations , because were it to pull out , its international prestige would suffer .
It would be a step backwards in its goal of becoming a world leader .
Such a move is easy to deride .
Many would cringe in disgust at treating Iran as an equal , let alone a leader like Ahmadinejad .
It may be especially unpleasant to give him such a propaganda coup .
But if international pressure is ever to change Iran , this is the direction it will have to take .
It might be surprising to hear , but Iranian leaders have long been thirsting for such a shift .
This is no clearer than with Ahmadinejad who has repeatedly offered to hold comprehensive talks with Obama and has even challenged him to a televised debate .
The reoccurring theme in Ahmadinejad 's offers is that of mutual respect .
He wants to talk to Obama "" man - to - man "" , "" face - to - face "" and about world issues , not just Iran 's problems .
What hope is there , really , of such an approach ever being taken up ?
Obama has already used the correct rhetoric , most notably in his Nowruz address to the Iranian people .
He spoke of seeking engagement grounded in "" mutual respect "" and even spoke of the "" true greatness of the Iranian people and civilisation "" .
If his rhetoric is supported by deeds , then political pressure has a good chance of breeding a more humane and democratic regime in Iran ."
2010-09-20,"We are writing to ask that the UN general assembly condemn stoning as a crime against humanity and issue an emergency resolution calling for an end to the medieval and barbaric punishment as well as the immediate release of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani and others sentenced to death by stoning .
We also ask that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad not be allowed to address the general assembly and that his government be boycotted .
A government that still stones people to death in the 21st century must have no place in the United Nations or any other international institution or body .

2010-09-21,"The arrival of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in New York for the UN general assembly has brought a predictable media frenzy .
Iran 's disputed president has already done interviews with a few experienced US journalists such as Christiane Amanpour and is due on the usual round of American TV studios with the Charlie Rose show on PBS , and CNN 's Larry King Live .
Ahmadinejad cherishes these moments as he is keen to use every chance to publicise his political designs .
The BBC even went so far as to call him a "" master of spin "" ; others say he has "" become more articulate and polished "" .
And now a debate is developing about why such experienced journalists rarely manage to crack his defences or get anything new out of him .
One reason is that interviewers seem unable to get away from a fixed set of questions and a specific mindset they have of Ahmadinejad .
They tend to repeat the same questions over , and with time he has become skilled at replying to them .
Some interviewers do n't keep up with the fact that since the imposition of sanctions he has said repeatedly that he does want to talk to the US or about a new nuclear deal .
They keep asking whether he will .
Ahmadinejad has moved on over the past six months and has new designs for the three remaining years of his presidency .
It could be argued that these are the kinds of topics that need to get more coverage in global television interviews if we are to avoid having another regional dictator .
Ahmadinejad is the most hardline rightwing president in Iran since the formation of the Islamic Republic in 1979 .
Since the disputed presidential elections of 2009 he has moved further to the right and combined this with an appeal to the young .
He seems to be nurturing a new doctrine of religious nationalism to attract the young .
Whereas previously his stress was more on Islam , now he glorifies the role of Iran as the true bastion of Islamic culture .
His AP interview in the US reflects this ambition .
Regionally , he stresses the old historical notions of the "" brotherhood "" of the Persian - speaking and Islamic countries of the region .
With the return last week of the Cyrus cylinder to Iran , Ahmadinejad likened himself to the Iranian king , Cyrus the Great , thereby parting from his previous stance on Iranian kings .
Previous to that , he likened himself to Iran 's popular nationalist leader , Mohammad Mossadeq , who nationalised oil against the British just after the second world war .
In recent weeks he has raised – to unprecedented levels – his confrontational style against the ruling clique in Iran .
Only last week he announced in direct contravention of Iran 's constitution that he is now the number two power in Iran after the supreme leader and he will define political decisions .
By making this statement he was challenging the words of the founder of the Islamic Republic , Ayatollah Khomeini , who put parliament above all powers .
His arch - rival , the conservative speaker of parliament , Ali Larijani , reminded him that the parliament will stand up to dictators .
He warned against the new "" Iranian doctrine "" and ridiculed Ahmadinejad , saying that "" this kind of talk is not up to your level "" .
Yet there seems to be no stopping Ahmadinejad .
He is even dismissive of Iran 's leader , Ali Khamenei .
He recently appointed the controversial Esfandiar Rahim - Mashaei as his special representative in the Middle East .
This seemed like a direct insult against the leader who had forbidden the appointment of Rahim Mashaei as vice - president because of his stance on Israel .
Yet no one could deter Ahmadinejad from the decision , not even his guru , Ayatollah Mesbah - Yazdi , who openly criticised him .
Rahim - Mashaei is his school friend and colleague in the Basij militia and Revolutionary Guards Corp ( IRGC ) and the two men are now working more closely on this new "" Iran doctrine "" .
Ahmadinejad has angered the supreme leader , Iranian diplomats , and parliament by bringing in more of his former IRGC colleagues , creating four special adviser posts – due to become six – with executive mandates , so that Iran 's regional policy will be firmly in his control .
The IRGC continues to give him support .
Recently it admitted openly to the brutal crackdown of the opposition after the disputed elections .
Moreover , this powerful organisation – angered by punitive international sanctions – has defined its regional ambitions , and displayed its military might during the past month .
The regional consequences of these ambitions are outlined in a recent study of Iran 's military capability , showing that Iran has developed a wide mix of land , air , and naval capabilities that can threaten its neighbours , challenge the US , and affect other parts of the Middle East and Asia .
Thus Ahmadinejad 's showmanship in television interviews in the US should not be viewed lightly .
It should be contrasted with the fact that he has more than 50 journalists in prison in Iran .
Since his serious abuse of human rights is well documented he should never be allowed to get away with his ridiculous claim that "" in Iran everyone is free "" nor be left to use "" the art of slipping and sliding around even the most seasoned interviewers "" ."
2010-09-23,"Delegates from the US and European countries walked out of the UN 's General Assembly hall during Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's speech when the Iranian president claimed "" most nations "" believed the US government was behind the September 11 attacks .
In his speech to the UN , Ahmadinejad said there was a theory "" that some segments within the US government orchestrated the attack to reverse the declining American economy , and its grips on the Middle East , in order to save the Zionist regime . ""
Ahmadinejad then said : "" The majority of the American people as well as most nations and politicians around the world agree with this view , "" during which point the US delegation rose from their seats and left , along with a number of other countries ' delegations .
In response the US delegation issued a statement : "" Rather than representing the aspirations and goodwill of the Iranian people , Mr Ahmadinejad has yet again chosen to spout vile conspiracy theories and anti - Semitic slurs that are as abhorrent and delusional as they are predictable . """
2010-09-23,"Intensifying economic difficulties at home , bitter factional infighting , and a regional power balance that is shifting to Iran 's disadvantage are among the factors currently pushing Tehran towards resumed nuclear negotiations with the western powers .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is an oddball among international leaders .
But Iran 's president is still a politician at heart – and after a fairly disastrous 12 months following last year 's disputed elections , he badly needs a win .
Inducing the US and its allies to resume talks on a fuel swap involving a Tehran research reactor , without broadening the talks to encompass the entirety of Iran 's suspect nuclear programme , would enable Ahmadinejad to present a victory of sorts to an increasingly jaded domestic audience .
This limited outcome is exactly what Washington and London want to avoid .
"" Our objective continues to be a comprehensive long - term negotiated solution which restores international confidence , "" said a joint statement issued by the western powers plus China and Russia in New York this week .
"" Now is the time for Iran to engage in real negotiation ... about its whole nuclear programme , "" said William Hague , the foreign secretary .
Briefing American journalists recently , Barack Obama expressed optimism that a combination of tougher international sanctions and technical problems affecting Iran 's uranium enrichment programme was pushing Tehran towards a more flexible stance .
This analysis appeared borne out this week when Ahmadinejad eschewed his usual anti - American rhetoric when addressing the UN general assembly – and indicated willingness to start talking again after a year - long stand - off .
US officials believe the latest UN and EU sanctions , backed by China and Russia , and specifically those aimed at Iran 's banking and energy sectors , are causing real pain .
"" We believe Iran 's leadership was caught off - guard by the speed , intensity and scope of the new measures , "" Stuart Levey , Obama 's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence , said this week .
Sanctions aside , Ahmadinejad 's austerity plan to cut up to $ 100bn ( £ 64bn ) in government subsidies on basic commodities , electricity and petrol – deemed essential as his underfunded government struggles to cut waste and corruption – presents his leadership with a potentially even more destabilising challenge .
Iranians are said to have been stunned by steep price rises implemented without warning this week , with some people reportedly facing a 1,000 % month - on - month rise in electricity bills .
Even the staunch Ahmadinejad ally , hardline Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati , is now worried about a public backlash .
"" We have a semi - abstemious period ahead of us .
The government should be careful to minimise the tensions and negative effects on poor people , "" he told a gathering at Friday prayers in Tehran . ""
In the end , Iran 's breaking point might not be broad international sanctions or the country 's opposition movement .
Instead , it might be Ahmadinejad 's own plan to slash long - standing , and enormous , government subsidies , "" wrote Becky Katz for Global Post , reporting from Tehran .
Backstabbing and squabbling among rival factions within the hardline camp may give Ahmadinejad further cause for concern about his position ahead of parliamentary elections due next year .
So far his key alliance with Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has held up – though not without some public arguments about the merits of re - engaging the US ( to which Khamenei is adamantly opposed ) .
The supra - nationalist Ahmadinejad , with his close links to the Revolutionary Guards and their vast business empire , is accused in some quarters of undermining the clergy 's leading role in the Islamic republic .
His long - running feud with Ali Larijani , the parliamentary speaker who he fired as national security chief , resurfaced recently when Larijani 's brother , who happens to be head of the judiciary , temporarily blocked the president 's conciliatory move , pre - New York , to free one of three Americans detained in Iran on spying charges .
Wednesday 's murderous bomb attack on a parade in Mahabad , in largely Kurdish north - west Iran , was a reminder , meanwhile , that Ahmadinejad 's united Iranian "" nation "" is a slightly deceptive concept .
Comprising numerous ethnic and religious minorities , Iran is far from being a homogeneous society .
Beneath the surface , unresolved and potentially exploitable tensions lurk , compounded in turn by last year 's brutal suppression of the legitimate , moderate political opposition .
Ahmadinejad 's quasi - delusional vision of Iran as a regional or even global superpower has also suffered some instructive collisions with reality of late .
Tehran 's attempt to engineer a malleable , Shia - only coalition government in Iraq , for example , has foundered , exposing the limits of its influence there .
This week , Russia suspended all heavy weapons and missile sales to Iran .
And a US - fuelled $ 123bn arms spending spree by the Arab states of the Gulf , in direct response to the perceived "" Persian threat "" , is perceptibly shifting the regional balance of power .
For all its martial bluster , ostentatious missile testing and anti - Israeli rhetoric , it 's plain even to the most militant of Tehran 's true believers that Iran is outgunned on the ground and in the air .
Much the same process is under way on the diplomatic and economic fronts .
Which may be why Ahmadinejad now appears ready to talk ."
2010-09-23,"President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran has accused the US government of orchestrating the 9/11 attacks to prop up Israel .
Speaking at the UN general assembly , just a few miles away from the still open wound of Ground Zero , he prompted a walkout from the chamber of delegates from the US and well as those of the UK and other European Union members .
US diplomats dismissed his comments as "" abhorrent and delusional "" .
At a time when Iran is being squeezed by sanctions imposed through the UN , Ahmadinejad showed no desire to extend a placatory hand and instead opted to repeat several old conspiracy theories relating to the terrorist attacks on September 11 2001 .
One theory of what happened on that day , he said , was "" the US government orchestrated the attack in order to save the Zionist regime in the Middle East "" .
Addressing representatives of the UN 's 192 member countries , the president said there was evidence that the US government had at least supported the attacks , including passports in the rubble of the Twin Towers of men who had been involved with US officials , while no trace of the alleged suicide attackers was retrieved .
Ahmadinejad 's 9/11 comments will hardly be seen as providing hope for a diplomatic way out of the impasse over Iran 's nuclear programme .
Earlier , US president Barack Obama had demanded that Iran meet its obligations in international conventions and "" confirm to the world the peaceful intent of its nuclear programme "" .
The Iranian leader said he remained "" ready for a dialogue based on respect and justice "" and for a "" free debate with American statesmen "" .
But he went on to warn that if the security council of the UN continued to use "" intimidation and sanctions "" it would destroy its own remaining credibility .
The theory that 9/11 was the act of a US agent provocateur , or even of George Bush himself , has long been one of the most prevalent conspiracy theories relating to the attacks .
Ahmadinejad compared the almost 3,000 people who died on 9/11 to the hundreds of thousands who had been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan .
•
This article was amended on 24 September 2010 to make clear that other EU members joined in the walkout along with the UK ."
2010-09-24,"Nick Clegg will today issue a strong condemnation of the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , telling the UN that his claims , made yesterday , that the US government was behind the 9/11 attacks on New York are "" bizarre , offensive and attention - grabbing "" .
The deputy prime minister has added the comments to a speech he is to due to make to the UN general assembly after an international outcry over Ahmadinejad 's comments to the same meeting yesterday .
Ahmadinejad accused the US government of orchestrating the 9/11 attacks to prop up Israel .
Speaking just a few miles away from Ground Zero in New York , he prompted a walkout of the US and UK delegations from the chamber .

Clegg will say : "" I was ready today to welcome the progress made in this week 's meeting of the E3 + 3 group on Iran .
I was ready to straightforwardly reiterate our concerns about Iran 's nuclear programme .
But instead , once again , an issue of grave global concern has been overshadowed by the bizarre , offensive and attention - grabbing pronouncements by President Ahmedinejad from this podium yesterday .
His remarks were intended to distract attention from Iran 's obligations and to generate media headlines .
They deserve to do neither . ""
At a time when Iran is being squeezed by sanctions imposed through the UN , Ahmadinejad showed no desire to extend a placatory hand and instead opted to repeat several old conspiracy theories relating to the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 .
One theory of what happened on that day , he said , was "" the US government orchestrated the attack in order to save the Zionist regime in the Middle East "" .

Ahmadinejad compared the almost 3,000 people who died on 9/11 to the hundreds of thousands who had been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan ."
2010-09-24,"Barack Obama made an angry personal attack on Mahmoud Ahmadinejad yesterday , saying claims by Iran 's president that the United States carried out the 9/11 terrorist attacks to prop up Israel were "" hateful , offensive and inexcusable "" .
Obama also used an interview with BBC Persian TV to appeal directly to the people of Iran , defending UN sanctions and urging them to believe the US wants a better relationship with the Islamic republic , repeating that it was only possible if it complied with international demands over its nuclear programme .
Ahmadinejad 's remarks to the UN general assembly on Thursday caused wide outrage and a walkout by diplomats from the US , Britain and many other countries .
The Iranian president said one "" theory "" of what happened in September 2001 was that "" the US government orchestrated the attack in order to save the Zionist regime in the Middle East "" .
Obama described this as outrageous and disgusting : "" Particularly for him to make the statement here in Manhattan , just a little north of Ground Zero , where families lost their loved ones , people of all faiths , all ethnicities who see this as the seminal tragedy of this generation ; for him to make a statement like that was inexcusable . ""
An unrepentant Ahmadinejad returned to the theme again yesterday , calling on the UN to set up a commission to study the attacks , for which al - Qaida claimed responsibility .
"" I did not pass judgment , but do n't you feel that the time has come to have a fact - finding committee , "" he asked during a news conference in New York .
He also said Iran would consider ending uranium enrichment if world powers sent Tehran nuclear fuel for a medical research reactor .
"" We will consider halting uranium enrichment whenever nuclear fuel is provided to us , "" he said .
In his interview , Obama said Ahmadinejad 's stance on 9/11 contrasted with Iranians ' reaction at the time : "" There were candlelight vigils and a natural sense of shared humanity and sympathy .
It shows once again the difference between how the Iranian leadership and this regime operate , and how the vast majority of the Iranian people who are respectful and thoughtful think about these issues . ""
Making this distinction was the point of his interview , broadcast on PTV last night , with a Persian translation , and likely to be seen by millions of Iranians despite official jamming .
It was an scoop for the London satellite channel set up in 2008 and enjoying far greater credibility than the Persian service of the Voice of America .
US officials had already called Ahmadinejad 's remarks "" abhorrent and delusional "" , but Obama 's public riposte is likely to have a global resonance .
The president said the point of the sanctions imposed by the US , the UN and the EU was to make the regime allay concern over the purpose of its nuclear programme .
For Tehran it was "" more important to defy the international community and engage in a covert nuclear weapons programme than to make sure people are prospering "" .
Obama repeated the offer made shortly after taking office in 2009 .
"" We 're willing to reach out with an open hand to the Iranian government and the Iranian people because we believe that there 's nothing inevitable that should cause Iran and the US to be enemies .
There 's a history there that is difficult .
But it can be bridged with mutual understanding , mutual respect .
"" At his press conference Ahmadinejad also lashed out at the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as an overreaction to 9/11 .
The Americans should "" not occupy the entire Middle East , bomb wedding parties , annihilate an entire village , just because one terrorist is hiding there , "" he said .
Obama conspicuously did not talk of a military option .
"" I do n't take war lightly , "" he told PTV .
"" I was opposed to the war in Iraq .
I am somebody who 's interested in resolving issues diplomatically . ""
He also emphasised that the US was acting with wide international support though he refused to say whether he would stop Israel if it decided to attack Iran . ""
Understandably , Israel is very concerned when the president of a country , a large country near them , states that they should be wiped off the face of the earth . ""
The president praised the "" courage "" of Iranians in the unrest that followed last year 's disputed elections , saying : "" We have no interest in meddling , in the rights of people that choose their own government , but we will speak out forcefully when we see governments abusing and oppressing their own people . ""
The Iranian government had "" delegitimised itself in ways that continue to reverberate around the world . ""
The White House said it hoped to encourage debate in Iran on the speech .
"" We will , to amplify the president 's messages , ... be blogging it , Tweeting it , posting on Youtube and , again , ensuring that we are doing everything that we can to disseminate the president 's words , "" an administration official said .
It was reported last night Ahmadinejad had met Sarah Shourd , an American hiker held last year near the Iran - Iraq border .
Shourd , released this month , was believed to have asked for release of her companions , Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal .
After the meeting she said it was "" a very gracious gesture [ and ]
… a very human encounter , very personal "" ."
2010-09-26,"President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's visits to New York are usually memorable for something .
Three years ago , he stunned the world with his claim there were no gays in Iran .
This time , he used his time at the world 's lectern to unwind the most convoluted and out - to - lunch conspiracy theory ever presented to the UN General Assembly - suggesting that 9/11 was an inside job .
The UN speech was all the more of a collective shock to the US as the visit had hitherto been billed , after a few softly - spoken interviews , as revealing the Iranian president 's more thoughtful , moderate side .
The initial analysis by most Iran - watchers was that the speech was aimed at Iranians rather than Americans .
On his Informed Comment blog , Juan Cole wrote : The speech was shown on Iranian television , and he was almost certainly actually playing to the audience back home .
He wanted to be on television on the world stage , poking America in the eye .
The next day , Ahmadinejad was seemingly amazed at the fuss .
"" Did I say anything wrong ? ""
he asked innocently .
He claimed not to see how his remarks might have any impact on the stalled talks over Iran 's nuclear programme .
"" What does this have to do with the nuclear issue ?
It has no connection to it , "" he insisted .
Barack Obama appears to have taken a surprisingly similar line in an interview with the BBC Persian Service .
Obama described the 9/11 comments as "" offensive "" and "" hateful "" , but then got down to business , insisting the road to a deal was still clear .
So the Iranian government itself has said we are not interested in nuclear weapons .
That 's their public statement .
If that 's the case , there should be a mechanism whereby they can assure and prove to the international community , including the IAEA , that that is in fact the case .
And if they take those constructive steps in serious negotiations , then not only should there not be a threat of war but there also wo n't be the sanctions that are currently in place .
On the other hand , Obama did none of the usual tiptoeing around Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
He referred bluntly to a "" covert nuclear weapons programme "" , as if its existence was beyond question .
It will be interesting to see if this becomes the new house style in the administration .
During the course of last week 's UN speechfest , the Israeli daily Ha'aretz reported that the US and Iran were trying to set up a diplomatic back channel .
It was a tantalisingly short report , low on details .
The interesting question is , if there was such a channel , where would it lead in Tehran ?
By all accounts , the president 's office was ready last year to do a deal over uranium fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor , but Ahmadinejad was over - ruled .
Ultimately , it was not his call .
But he is currently in the throes of a power struggle at home , and his position may change , one way or another .
Away from the spotlight and the supercharged rhetoric , work continued in New York to try to pin down a date from the next round of talks , aimed at resuming bargaining over the Tehran reactor deal as a possible overture to wider discussions .
Ahmadinejad said he hoped that the talks would begin in October , but there has been no word so far from the Iranian negotiating team on an exact date .
Doing business with a government at war with itself is frustrating , but that are no attractive options , and no one at this stage is ready to give up all hope ."
2010-09-27,"Barack Obama and Iran 's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad hogged the headlines at the United Nations annual general assembly , which opened in New York last week .
This was predictable .
Western media perspectives , often reflecting the priorities of western governments , offer only a partial , selective view of the issues that really matter to the majority of the world 's poorer , less influential and less "" important "" countries .
One by one , national leaders took to the UN podium to discuss the threats and conflicts that roil their countries , the inequalities and institutional barriers that hinder them , and the visions that inspire them .
There was anger , eloquence and passion .
But much of what they said went unreported internationally and was therefore largely ignored .
Here are some excerpts from the "" other "" UN debate that you may have missed : • Rwanda 's president Paul Kagame spoke for many developing countries in complaining of double standards .
"" It has become clear that the UN has evolved into a two - tier organisation , reflecting a world that seems to be divided into two categories : one with inherent laudable values , rights and liberties , and another that needs to be taught and coached on these values , "" Kagame said .
Rwanda , where the conduct of recent elections was criticised in the west , appeared to fall into the latter category , and was marginalised and disenfranchised as a result , he said .
• Senegal 's president Abdoulaye Wade led African countries in demanding UN reform – a call backed by Arab states ( as well as by Japan , the EU and Australia ) .
Failure to give Africa a permanent security council seat would exacerbate mistrust and defiance of its authority , he said , apparently referring to recent controversies over Iraq , UN sanctions on Iran , and international criminal court indictments .
"" How can one conceive of a credible role for our organisation in world governance while Africa , comprising more than a quarter of its [ peacekeeping ] troops and occupying 70 % of the council 's agenda , has no permanent seat on it ? ""
he asked .
•
Bolivia 's president Evo Morales adopted an idealistic stance , contrasting with the world - weariness of some western leaders .
Morales proposed a grand international alliance to save humankind by guaranteeing equality and social justice for all .
Clean water and electricity were basic human rights , he said , and the environment must be protected at all costs .
"" How can Mother Earth be turned into a business ? ""
• Kanat Saudabayev , foreign minister of Kazakhstan , a former Soviet republic and the world 's biggest uranium producer , said all UN members should ratify the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and called on nuclear weapons powers ( such as the US and Britain ) to provide security assurance to non - nuclear states .
"" For the people of Kazakhstan , who know too well the horrors of nuclear tests , the issue of their total ban is of special relevance , "" he said .
During Soviet times , he added , 490 nuclear explosions were detonated at the Semipalatinsk test site , "" affecting more than half a million people and damaging territory as big as today 's Germany "" .
•
Somalia 's president , Sharif Sheikh Ahmed , whose government controls only a small slice of territory in Mogadishu , said progress in ending the civil war , curbing Islamist terrorism , and providing basic services was being made – but that additional international help was desperately needed .
Kenya 's president , Mwai Kibaki , was more forthright .
Western countries had failed to follow through on strengthening peacekeeping forces and institutions in Somalia , focusing instead on curbing piracy . ""
Somalia continues to suffer benign neglect from the international community , leading to many lost opportunities , "" he said , adding that western countries should also increase their engagement in Sudan as January 's secession referendum looms .
•
There was moderately hopeful news from another conflict zone when Serbia 's president , Boris Tadić , announced his government was ready to engage in good - faith dialogue on Kosovo , which unilaterally declared its independence in 2008 .
But further east , in the Caucasus , the dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the Nagorno - Karabakh enclave appears to be worsening .
Armenia 's foreign minister , Edward Nalbandian , accused Azerbaijan of "" unabated war rhetoric , increased violations of the ceasefire regime and the unprecedented increase "" of its military budget .
Azerbaijan replied in much the same vein .
The assembly debate also heard worrying statements about other potentially dangerous disputes affecting Cyprus and Georgia .
•
Not one to be left out
, Zimbabwe 's president Robert Mugabe returned to the theme of supposed western double standards in Africa , saying that international sanctions have caused "" untold suffering "" among Zimbabweans . ""
The people of Zimbabwe should , like every other sovereign state , be left to freely chart their own destiny , "" he said .
But US officials made it clear that Washington would not consider relaxing sanctions until Zimbabwe 's leader paid more respect to human rights .
•
Spain 's foreign minister , Miguel Ángel Moratinos , had some rare praise for the UN , lauding the "" effective multilateralism "" shown in its responses to natural disasters including January 's Haiti earthquake and the Pakistan floods .
Relief efforts had worked because they were based on mutual respect , he said .
He urged further reform of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to meet new challenges .
•
Dominica 's president , Nicholas JO Liverpool , meanwhile highlighted a wholly unnatural disaster , namely the growing trade in illegal drugs headed for North America and the linked rise in the availability of small arms and light weapons , a Caribbean development mirroring trends in Colombia and Mexico .
Dominica was "" in the crossfire "" but lacked the capacity to deal with the threat , Liverpool said .
"" It appears to us that the larger nations of the world only take decisive steps to cope with this situation when it has become untenable for themselves . ""
•
Perhaps the most plaintive contribution came from Gjorge Ivanov , president of Macedonia ( known to Greece and to the UN , officially at least , as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ) .
Ivanov said he was hopeful that Greek objections to his country 's name would be overcome and that Athens would stop blocking its efforts to join the EU and Nato .
If two neighbours could not agree on such an issue , what hope was there for resolving much bigger disputes ?
"" It [ an agreement ] will be a big step for us , but a huge step towards fulfilling the common vision for our whole region , "" he said .
Like the overall UN agenda , it was a question of human dignity ."
2010-10-06,"Lebanon looks set to allow the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , to make a highly controversial visit to its border with Israel next week .
The US has been leading diplomatic efforts to persuade the Beirut government that Ahmadinejad 's presence in strongholds of the Shia movement Hezbollah in south Lebanon will pose a security risk that could provoke serious violence .
But the signs are that the trip will go ahead , diplomats said today .
According to some reports Ahmadinejad will symbolically throw stones across the border fence into Israel , which he regularly attacks as an illegitimate entity , as well as questioning the truth of the Nazi Holocaust .
Israel is also concerned by Iran 's nuclear energy programme , which it claims is intended to produce nuclear weapons which would challenge its own undeclared atomic arsenal .
The reported two - day itinerary for Ahmadinejad 's first state visit to Lebanon includes Qana , where he is to lay a wreath on the graves of Lebanese killed by Israeli forces .
Another likely stop is Bint Jbeil , the scene of heavy fighting between Hezbollah and Israel in the 2006 war .
Posters welcoming Ahmadinejad in Arabic and Persian have already appeared in the area amid reports that the Iranian leader , with a business delegation in tow , will bring investment , financing for oil exploration and a controversial offer to sell weapons to the Lebanese army .
Iranian embassy officials in Beirut have refused to confirm details of the southern leg of the trip , but Hezbollah is said to be massing supporters to welcome Ahmadinejad as a hero of the resistance .
Hezbollah , which is supported by Iran , has warned that the US and Israel have no right to oppose the visit , which its TV channel al - Manar hailed yesterday as "" a non - conventional bomb in the face of enemies wherever they are "" .
Representations have been made to the Beirut government by the US , France and the UN .
Britain believes a direct appeal to cancel the visit to the border would be counterproductive as it could be seen as infringing Lebanese sovereignty .
But it and other western governments have urged the exercise of caution in a highly volatile area .
Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , raised the issue with the Lebanese president , Michel Suleiman , at the UN in New York last week .
US officials also stress that Iran is undermining Lebanon 's sovereignty by backing Hezbollah .
The Shia organisation has refused to yield its largely - Iranian supplied weaponry to the Lebanese armed forces and is listed by the US as a terrorist organisation .
Israel is urging that the visit should be cancelled as it will undermine regional stability as well as strengthen the axis between Iran , Syria and Hezbollah .
The well - informed Beirut daily an - Nahar reported that Ahmadinejad 's visit would go ahead despite objections .
But observers in Beirut said one possibility was that he would only visit Iranian - financed reconstruction projects and not go right up to the Israeli border for the stone throwing — on obvious security grounds .
Iran 's foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , insisted on Tuesday that it was natural for the president to visit such projects .
Ahmadinejad is due to meet Suleiman ; the prime minister , Saad al - Hariri ; the speaker , Nabih Berri ; and Hezbollah leaders .
Supporters of Hariri 's March 14 group have attacked the visit as a bid to underline Iran 's ability to disrupt regional peace efforts .
Hariri 's bloc is also concerned about Hezbollah manoeuvring around the tribunal investigating the 2005 murder of his father Rafiq .
Israeli officials say they fear the visit will go ahead and are ramping up border security following an armed clash in August that left five dead .
Aluf Benn , a respected liberal columnist with the Haaretz newspaper , has suggested that Ahmadinejad be abducted and tried in Israel for incitement to genocide and Holocaust denial ."
2010-10-08,"The Iranian government is very enthusiastic about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's coming visit to southern Lebanon and has been doing much to promote it .
The state - owned PressTV news outlet – which Ahmadinejad was instrumental in setting up – has been at the forefront of promoting the visit .
In one article it hailed the trip as a "" visit for unity "" .
In another , it quoted Hezbollah 's Christian ally , Michel Aoun , as saying the visit will be in line with "" strengthening relations between the two countries "" .
While in Lebanon , Ahmadinejad is expected to tour the southern border , including the town of Bint Jbeil , which is a Hezbollah stronghold .
Meanwhile , according to the London - based al - Quds al - Arabi , Ahmadinejad will also throw stones towards Israel from the Fatima border crossing garden which he will be inaugurating , close to Israel 's border .
In Israel and the US , the reaction to the trip has been very negative .
The Israeli government has openly stated that it views the trip as "" a provocative measure that could undermine regional stability and should therefore be cancelled "" .
At the same time the Obama administration has warned the Lebanese government about the risks such a visit could pose .
Lebanon 's largest parliamentary bloc , March 14 Alliance ( backed by the US and Saudi Arabia ) has also described Ahmadinejad 's visit as "" provocative "" .
There are certainly good reasons to view it as provocative .
The atmosphere in Lebanon 's domestic arena is very tense , due to the forthcoming Hariri assassination trial , where it is widely believed that Hezbollah members will be indicted .
The visit could thus be interpreted as a warning from Iran that it stands firmly behind Hezbollah , and that anyone who is thinking of taking action against Hezbollah , be it political or military , should think twice .
The visit also comes at a time when tensions between Iran and Israel are at a high .
Ahmadinejad visiting Lebanon 's southern border could confirm the fear of many Israelis that the Iranian regime has truly arrived on its doorstep .
And to add insult to injury , the man who has denied the Holocaust and has called for Israel 's elimination is now coming to throw stones .
However , what both the US and Israel should note is that the biggest reason why Ahmadinejad has decided to go to Lebanon is domestic .
Israel and the US are further down his list of priorities .
The Iranian president is visiting Lebanon mainly because of his growing unpopularity at home .
In fact , Ahmadinejad has never been more unpopular in Iran , not only with the public but also his conservative allies and the clergy .
By going to Lebanon , he is going to one of the last places where the Islamic Republic still has genuine support .
When he speaks in Bint Jbeil , unlike in Iran , schools wo n't be closed and civil servants wo n't be threatened with dismissal unless they attend the president 's speech .
People will voluntarily turn up because they genuinely support the Islamic republic and will pay respect to almost any senior Iranian politician .
By going to Lebanon , Ahmadinejad will primarily be using the occasion to try to strengthen his support back home with the public , and with the Revolutionary Guards , whose support is important to him .
He will also be trying to outshine his rivals such as Ali Larijani and Hashemi Rafsanjani by using the trip to say that he is the true face of Iran abroad , and not them .
This development will also benefit supreme leader Ali Khamenei , who is most probably very concerned about Ahmadinejad 's flagging popularity .
What is important to note is that such a visit did not take place when Khatami was president .
If anyone deserves to be in southern Lebanon , it is him , and not Ahmadinejad .
Israel evacuated southern Lebanon in May 2000 on Khatami 's watch , not Ahmadinejad 's .
However , Khamenei did not send Khatami to southern Lebanon because he was not worried about his unpopularity .
In fact , compared with Ahmadinejad , he was far more popular .
The opposite is true about Ahmadinejad and this is why Khamenei , for the sake of his regime , is sending him there .
Another important goal of the trip is to solidify the foundations of Iran 's anti - Israel policy which has been weakening recently .
The regime is becoming increasingly concerned about opposition chants such as "" No Gaza , no Lebanon , my life for Iran "" .
Prior to the recent Qods Day , newspapers were full of articles about why this chant undermines the lessons of Ayatollah Khomeini 's teachings .
The very fact that so much attention was paid to it is a clear sign of concern .
Such concern reached new highs after Ali Saeedlou , vice - president and head of Physical Education Organisation , sent a letter to Khamenei asking him to clarify whether Iranian sportsmen must boycott Israeli athletes .
After 31 years , the very fact that senior officials are questioning what has been the unquestionable until now is a sign of cracks appearing in one of the pillars of the regime 's anti - Israeli policies .
We should also not forget Turkey .
By going to Lebanon , the Iranian regime will be hoping to strengthen its position in one of the areas where the Turkish prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , has not overtaken them in popularity .
Five years of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's presidency have shown that he damages whatever he touches .
By going to Lebanon he could in fact cause more trouble and headache for Hezbollah , both at home , and in the Arab world .
In the long run , Hassan Nasrallah , the Hezbollah leader , is likely to have more reasons to worry than Netanyahu ."
2010-10-13,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was given a warm welcome in Lebanon today despite fears that his visit will aggravate domestic tensions in the politically divided country by boosting the militant Shia group Hezbollah , which is supported by Tehran .
Thousands of Hezbollah supporters cheered Iran 's president and waved Iranian flags as he spoke , partly in Arabic , at a mass rally in a football stadium in Beirut 's Shia southern suburbs this evening .
"" Lebanon is the school of resistance and steadfastness against all the bullying forces in the world , "" he told the crowd .
Earlier , Ahmadinejad was showered with rice and flowers – a traditional greeting – by crowds lining the highway from the airport as he defied security fears and stood to wave through the roof of his car .
The Iranian leader laid a wreath at the statue to Lebanon 's martyrs in Beirut 's central square but did not visit the nearby tomb of the murdered former prime minister Rafiq al - Hariri , as visiting dignitaries usually do .
Tensions are running high over the murder , with expectations that Hezbollah members could be indicted by a UN tribunal investigating the 2005 killing , possibly triggering violence on the streets .
The militant group 's leader , Hassan Nasrallah , welcomed Ahmadinejad to this evening 's ally from a giant video screen – owing , apparently , to worries about his own security .
Ahmadinejad , speaking at the presidential palace at Ba'abda after meeting his Lebanese counterpart , Michel Suleiman , said : "" The Iranian nation will always stand beside the Lebanese nation and never abandon them …
We will surely help the Lebanese nation against violations … by the Zionist regime [ Israel ] .
Our region does not need the intervention of any external forces . ""
He is due tomorrow to tour areas in southern Lebanon where Hezbollah is popular .
It remains unclear whether he will , as reported , throw stones across the border into Israel in an act of symbolic defiance .
Israel lobbied the Lebanese government over the visit and the US and France warned it against provocative actions by Ahmadinejad .
Washington argued that Hezbollah was undermining Lebanon 's sovereignty .
The movement , which is hailed by many Lebanese for its resistance to Israel , has not disarmed since the 2006 war and is said to have replenished its arsenal in preparation for future conflict .
A statement from the White House today again called the visit "" provocative "" .
An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman called Ahmadinejad "" a warmonger who has come to Lebanon to play with fire "" .
Analysts say Ahmadinejad and hardliners in Tehran – facing economic problems at home and international pressure over the nuclear programme – want to affirm Iran 's regional importance and show that it is ready to confront US and Israeli policies , at least by supporting their enemies .
Lebanon 's defence minister , Elias Murr , told the Guardian that despite a series of agreements between the two countries there had been no discussion of Iran 's offer to arm the Lebanese Armed Forces , made after the US Congress suspended assistance to the LAF in August following a rare border clash with Israel .
"" There 's been no talk of that , but what Lebanon wants is an army that can protect the land , fight terrorism and believes in values , "" he said .
Murr also reiterated Suleiman 's statement that Lebanon supports Iran 's right to nuclear power , a stance likely to strengthen the position of hawks in Washington who wish to cut US military assistance .
Iran did agree a £ 283 m loan for Lebanon to support power and water projects .
Iran is also heavily involved in reconstruction projects in the south .
Ahmadinejad also held discussions with Nabih Berri , the speaker of parliament and Lebanon 's senior Shia politician , as well as prime minister Saad Hariri , son of the murdered former premier , whom Lebanese news channels reported as being less than comfortable with the talks ."
2010-10-13,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , is enjoying a far warmer welcome in Lebanon than he usually gets on his foreign trips –
certainly more than at the UN last month when he provoked outrage by suggesting that the US might have organised the 9/11 attacks to protect Israel .
Beset by economic problems and infighting in Tehran , he is being received as a VIP by the Lebanese government – though he is not actually a head of state – but more significantly as a hero of the resistance by the Shia movement Hezbollah in Beirut 's southern suburbs and tomorrow in their strongholds near the border with Israel .
Ahmadinejad 's reception is an uncomfortable reminder that Iran is a Middle Eastern power to be reckoned with far beyond its own backyard .
Even if he does not now carry out a reported plan to symbolically throw stones across the frontier at the "" Zionist enemy "" , there is an unmistakeable sense that he is symbolically and defiantly inspecting Iran 's "" frontline "" against Israel .
Hezbollah is delighted .
Al - Manar , its TV station , has been building up to the two - day visit with a combination of extravagant praise and saracastic asides about how the US and Israel have no right to object to Ahmadinejad 's presence .
Links between Iran and Lebanon , especially the Shia heartland of Jebel Amel in the south , go back centuries , but it is the relationships that were forged at the time of the Iranian revolution in 1979 , and nurtured since , that matter today .
Hezbollah began life as the Islamic Revolution in Lebanon , and its clenched fist and Kalashnikov rifle logo echoes inspiration from Iran .
It emerged from the shadows after Israel 's invasion of 1982 , which struck hard at Yasser Arafat 's PLO but created a powerful new enemy .
Not all Lebanese attitudes are based on sectarian affiliation .
The president , Michel Suleiman , is a Maronite Christian , as laid down in the constitution .
General Michel Aoun , the Christian leader of the Free Patriotic Movement , allied with Hezbollah in parliament , has welcomed the visit .
So , formally at least , has Samir Geagea of the Lebanese Forces .
Nervousness among Sunni Muslims is palpable : one group publicly urged Ahmadinejad not to use Lebanon to "" spearhead "" attacks on Israel .
Memories of the devastating war of 2006 are still fresh and Israel is overhwhelmingly the superior power – even if Hezbollah has restocked its rocket arsenal since the last round .
It will be fascinating to see if Hezbollah 's leader , Hassan Nasrallah , meets Ahmadinejad in public : he usually addresses meetings on a giant video screen because of fears for his security .
For Lebanon 's ever volatile internal politics the timing of Ahmadinejad 's visit could hardly be worse .
Tensions have been mounting in recent weeks over the explosive issue of the UN tribunal investigating the 2005 assassination of Rafiq al - Hariri , the former Sunni prime minister and father of the current incumbent , Sa'ad .
Expectations that the court will shortly issue indictments against members of Hezbollah have already raised the political temperature several degrees .
The guest from Iran is a reminder that Hezbollah has powerful friends ."
2010-10-14,"Just over the partition separating hundreds of female Hezbollah supporters from their male counterparts , a heated discussion is being held .
A teenage security guard , identified as Hezbollah - approved by a green card badge safety - pinned to his T - shirt , wants to pray without leaving the large square in south Beirut where the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is due to speak .
The only thing he can find to pray on , however , is one of the A4 posters of Ahmadinejad that had been laid out on endless seats to be raised in adulation at the appropriate time .
A discussion ensues between the teenager and a couple of security guards .
He ca n't place the poster on the floor with Ahmadinejad facing upwards , because it would be considered idolatry if he kneels over the image of a man .
Would it send the wrong message to pray on the back of the poster , leaving Ahmadinejad nose down on the rubble floor ?
Another teenager excitedly brings an A2 version of the same poster into the discussion : if you are going to do it – he offers – you might as well use the bigger version and not get yourself dusty .
A compromise is reached , the boys agree that they will rub Ahmadinejad 's face into the dirt but that they would use the smaller poster to minimise the insult .
Media reports covering the hero 's welcome offered to Ahmadinejad in Lebanon on Wednesday assumed that flag - waving and cheering crowds suggested profound support for the Iranian president .
But in Dahiyeh last night at a rally organised in honour of Ahmadinejad , thousands of bored Hezbollah supporters sat around on brown plastic chairs as the Iranian president addressed them in person .
Several women behind me tittered at Ahmadinejad 's soft Iranian accent when he began to speak .
Others started to look over the partition to check out Hezbollah 's male talent .
The girl in front of me , who had been excitedly waving her Lebanese flag when Ahmadinejad made his grand entrance , now yawned and picked the thread out of her flag instead of bothering to listen to his speech .
The support that Ahmadinejad enjoys in Lebanon 's Shia heartlands can be compared to the support that a corporate sponsor might expect from Manchester United fans : bored gratitude .
The biggest cheer that Ahmadinejad 's speech managed to raise out of the crowd came when he thanked Hezbollah 's leader , Hassan Nasrallah , as a "" dear warrior and scholar "" .
Nasrallah was the real star of the show .
Rumours that he might appear in person at the rally drew large expectant crowds .
Though there was a sigh of disappointment when Nasrallah only appeared via video link , the forceful and impassioned clarity with which he spoke whipped the crowd into a flag - waving and slogan - chanting frenzy .
Nasrallah spoke mindfully of his larger audience in Lebanon , and tried the novel approach of presenting Iran 's foreign policy as "" unifying "" .
He praised Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , for issuing a fatwa forbidding Muslims to react to the Qur'an burning - fiasco in the US with "" similar acts "" , claiming that Iran was acting in the best interests of Christian - Muslim unity .
He also congratulated the Iranian cleric for his handling of a highly controversial London conference in which a little - known Shia activist disparaged Aisha , the wife of the prophet Muhammad , who is highly revered by Sunnis but considered a traitor by many Shias .
Iran 's supreme leader Khamenei had responded with a statement forbidding insulting talk about the wives of the prophet , thereby – according to Nasrallah – acting as a force for unity between Sunnis and Shias .
Many Lebanese would have a lot to say about claims that Iran is a "" unifying force in the region "" , but the speech did make clear that Nasrallah 's crowd appeal is unmatched and that his power among many Shias does not need to be enforced by Iran .
If anything , Hezbollah deftly staged a welcome for Ahmadinejad designed to encourage the Iranians to dig deeper and give more generously to Hezbollah 's cause .
While Ahmadinejad was still speaking , I whispered to the teenage girl sitting in front of me : "" Who do you prefer ; Ahmadinejad or Nasrallah ? ""
"" Nasrallah !
"" she replied rolling her eyes . ""
Nasrallah is one of us .
And anyway , Ahmadinejad is boring . """
2010-10-14,"The event was organised by Hezbollah , the "" party of God "" whose martyrs stared down from giant billboards in a specially built stadium .
But as the helicopter carrying Mahmoud Ahmadinejad circled above tens of thousands of Shia Muslims in Bint Jbeil , south Lebanon , the atmosphere came close to that of a rock concert .
Hezbollah security fought to hold back delirious young men trying to throw themselves over barriers as the Iranian president , making his first state visit to Lebanon , took to the stage to address supporters in the heartland of what he called Lebanon 's "" school of resistance "" . ""
Today the resistance in Lebanon has become an example to the resistance of all the nations , "" Ahmadinejad told the crowd to cheers , lashing out at "" Zionists "" in Israel who he said would soon be forced to "" admit defeat "" .
"" Resistance is the key of victory to the Lebanese nation and all the nations in the region , "" Ahmadinejad said .
In a separate section , women called out for water as those who had fainted were carried out on stretchers .
Thousands of balloons in the red , white and green of the Iranian flag drifted across the sky , to fall over the highways and billboards of Lebanon , which has been transformed to welcome Ahmadinejad .
It was his nation that established Hezbollah and arms the group , the only Arab fighting force to have held its own against Israel 's hugely superior military . ""
The soul of our families is beating with pride on seeing you in the land of clerics and martyrs and victory , "" said Mohammed Raad , a Hezbollah MP introducing the Iranian president .
"" The resistance [ Hezbollah ] and Iran are linked ideologically .
That 's why we are seen as a threat .
"" Iran 's president may be reviled in the west , but in this town – still rebuilding after it was devastated by some of the fiercest fighting in the July 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israeli troops – Ahmadinejad could have been in no doubt he was among friends , just a few miles from the border with Israel . ""
Ahmadinejad is our only support , "" said Um Hassan , a 38-year - old shouting to make herself heard above the thunder of music .
"" When everyone was against us , when the Arabs were against us , he was the only one who was with us .
Iran has built up our country and supports us with money .
Ahmadinejad can be a leader for humanity , both Muslim and Christian . ""
Um Hassan had been waiting for four hours and was overheating in her full black chador .
But she said : "" It 's definitely been worth it .
This is history .
"" There were cheers as the names of the Lebanese president , Michel Suleiman , and the Shia speaker of parliament , Nabih Berri , were read out to the crowd , but there were awkward jeers when Sa'ad al - Hariri , the Sunni prime minister , was announced , underscoring the deep political and religious divides that continue to threaten this country 's stability .
Hassan Nasrallah , the Hezbollah leader , has said an investigation into the assassination of Hariri 's father , Rafiq , a five - time prime minister , will indict Hezbollah members in the killing , a move he has attacked as an American and Israeli conspiracy against his militant group .
There were reports of Israeli helicopters circling close to the border , but they did not cross into Lebanon .
In advance of Ahmadinejad 's visit there had been calls in Israel to try to assassinate the Iranian president , comparing him to Hitler in 1939 .
There was no sign of a reported plan for him to throw stones across the border in a symbolic act of defiance .
Ahmadinejad was accompanied on his trip by his wife , Azam Farahi , who visited the southern village of Mleeta , where Hezbollah recently opened an outdoor museum displaying captured Israeli tanks and replicas of underground tunnels used by militants in their fight against the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon , which ended in 2000 .
Farahi met the Hezbollah women 's committee and the families of dead fighters .
On leaving Bint Jbeil , Ahmadinejad travelled to Qana , site of Israeli airstrikes that have twice killed dozens of civilians .
"" I came to say peace be upon Qana , the land of endurance and resistance , "" Ahmadinejad said .
"" Today , Qana is a living evidence of the valiant resistance and of the Israeli enemy 's criminal mentality . """
2010-10-18,"Iran has for the first time publicly backed Nouri al - Maliki to lead Iraq for a second term , hours after Maliki arrived in Tehran today for a rare meeting with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Maliki is due to travel to Qom later to meet his former foe turned ally Moqtada al - Sadr , who has aligned his powerful political bloc with Maliki 's coalition .
The Guardian revealed yesterday that Iran had brokered a deal between Sadr and Maliki and had recently used its sway with Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon in an attempt to shut out US input into a new government .
The revelations of increased Iranian involvement in Iraq at a time when the departing US military is scaling back its influence have caused ripples inside Iraq , where Maliki 's visit is being cast by the Iraqi media as a job application .
Iran 's deputy foreign minister , Rauf Sheibani , said Maliki was "" one of the suitable choices "" to lead the next government .
His words were interpreted as a clear endorsement in Iraq , which is accustomed to high - stakes negotiations taking place behind closed doors .
Agencies also reported Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , urging Iraq to resolve the political impasse that has afflicted the country since inconclusive elections in March . ""
Formation of a government as soon as possible and establishment of full security are among the important needs of Iraq because development and reconstruction of Iraq ... ca n't be achieved without these two , "" Khamenei was quoted by state TV as telling Maliki .
A brief survey by the Guardian of people in Baghdad , all aligned to different sects and political blocs , revealed a broad acceptance of Iranian involvement in Iraqi society .
Mushan al - Sa'adi , 50 , a party member of the Iraqiya list , which is the key rival to Maliki 's state - of - law bloc , said it was right for US forces to continue their withdrawal and for Iraq to form new relationships with its neighbours .
"" Iran is not our enemy , "" he said .
"" They are our neighbour and we need to deal with them .
It does n't mean they need to interfere though . ""
Omeran Azad , 35 , a backer of the Iraqi president , Jalal Talabani , and his Kurdish support base , said accepting Iran was a matter of "" realism "" .
"" We should accept that all regional powers have a role here .
Iran is more active than others , but the US is not weak and I think they will stay till 2020 .
Their embassy here is the largest in the world and they will build their relationship with Iraq through investment and economics , "" he said .
Some expect a continued interventionist role from the US .
Unadim Kanna , one of five Christian members of Iraq 's parliament , said both the US and Iran needed to act as guarantors for Iraq 's future .
"" Iran sheltered the opposition to Saddam for a long time and those opposition members have now become Iraq 's leaders , "" he said .
"" Iran is still supporting them and that is natural . ""
Abdul Hadi al - Husani , a member of Maliki 's Dawa party , said : "" The new Iraq is passing through a transition .
Many countries are playing a role here , according to their own interests .
We need to stop both Iran and the US from interfering . ""
Sami Ali , a hospital guard and Sadrist , said : "" Of course Iran is interfering now .
They are trying hard to accelerate the forming of the new government .
Iran works to secure safety in the region and they want a government here that guarantees their interests .
Maliki together with the Sadrists is a very good alliance .
We will not accept the Americans staying here .
We want to turn a page on the occupation . ""
Mahmoud Shater , a member of the rival Shia Islamic bloc to Maliki , known as the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq , said : "" Iran has a stronger role than America here .
[ The Shia coalition ] has no one else to support them apart from Iran .
The Saudis or the Turks will not support them , so what will they do ?
The Shia in Iraq were oppressed for 35 years and it is now the time for them to take their rights . ""
Jia Zuneri , a Kurd , said : "" Iran makes all the decisions here .
Everything comes from their central committee .
We need the Americans to stay .
Even the chief of the Iraqi army says that .
The security situation has not stabilised . ""

2010-10-18,"The complicity of western media with their governments could not have been more clear this past week , when the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , came to Lebanon .
The message that his visit was a "" provocation "" , as it had been labelled by the US , French and Israeli governments , was dutifully reinforced by those countries ' media .
One American journalist , functioning more as a propagandist , wrote in Slate : "" This is Ahmadinejad 's first visit to Lebanon , and he could n't have picked a better time to provoke outrage . ""
But just who did he outrage exactly ?
In total , hundreds of thousands of mostly Shia Lebanese came out to the various events celebrating Ahmadinejad 's visit .
Even rightwing Christian politicians in Lebanon such as Samir Geagea – who could n't be further away on the political spectrum from Hezbollah and Iran – came out to welcome Ahmadinejad , who he described afterwards as "" moderate "" in tone .
To add some colour to their articles , many reporters made a point of mentioning an incident where two camels and 10 sheep were apparently slaughtered during the welcoming ceremony .
A Sydney Morning Herald article opened : "" Camels were sacrificed in his honour , their blood flowed through the streets and the air filled with a roar of welcome . ""
Some even tried to explain the significance of animal slaughter in Islam .
I 'm not even going to reach for a book on my shelf or search Wikipedia to find Islam 's connection to animal killing .
Instead I 'll resort to common sense : human beings kill animals .
In English we call them butchers .
Not one article bothered to mention that the "" sacrificed "" camels , with "" their long , graceful necks slit open "" would actually be eaten afterwards .
When it involves Arabs or Muslims , the implication is that they 're savages killing merely for the sake of killing .
But more important than what was included in most western coverage of the past week was what was left out .
The misrepresentation of Hezbollah and the Islamic Republic of Iran remains rampant in western media coverage .
Both are always painted with a broad "" anti - western "" brush that neglects their origins .
The Islamic Republic was a result of 26 years of a western - imposed absolute monarch that brutally repressed all dissent , especially the Islamic movements .
In 1979 , those Islamists led a nationwide revolt that overthrew the west 's puppet .
In Lebanon , a few years later , Hezbollah was born .
At a time when the predominantly Shia south of the country was under attack and occupation by Israel ( the US 's "" special friend "" in the region ) those same Lebanese Shias organised and armed themselves with the aiding of the nascent Iranian regime to liberate their land .
And they did , twice .
With such crucial historical context , it 's not hard to understand how such groups can be both fiercely opposed to the policies of western governments and also have legitimate grassroots support .
Lebanon has always been the arena for many of the region 's political battles .
And Hezbollah , largely for its uncompromising resistance to Israel and the west , has become the most powerful player in the Lebanese political landscape .
And by extension , Hezbollah 's allies , Syria and Iran – operating amid western - backed despots and disastrous western - led wars and occupations – have also enjoyed an increase in their regional influence .
If Ahmadinejad 's visit to Lebanon signalled anything , it 's that the balance of power is shifting in the Middle East .
And as that happens we 'll most likely see even more leaders and movements in this region take stands against the policies of western governments .
More camels may even be killed in the process .
Hopefully western media can distance themselves from their governments to accurately report these changes , rather than share in their condemnation and disappointment , paving the way for them to put their threats of war into practice ."

Game of Attrition .
Ahmadinejad 's defeats on the budget and his plan to distribute cash payments to lower - income Iranians show that power centers , such as the Majles , are actively working to pressure the President prior to the June election , according to [ Source removed ] .
These power centers are also stepping up their lobbying of Supreme Leader Khamenei to get his backing to stall or overturn some Presidential authorities .
This game is increasingly being played out in the media , where the sides openly attack each other , and where the President 's public defenses are weakening his hand and depleting political capital that he would prefer to save for the bigger fights ahead .
The cash payment plan could have garnered AN additional votes , but he continues to "" work the rounds "" in the provinces and maintain his base of support where it really matters .
By June , the current policy debates will matter less , and it is too early to consider these moves decisive to AN 's electoral prospects , according to the economist .
Comment :
If these power centers can get increased backing from Khamenei , we may see some interesting fireworks in Iranian press in the coming weeks .
As IRPO has previously reported , identifying the power centers responsible for AN ' setbacks on economic policy last month is difficult but could include a broad spectrum of political factions .

[ Name removed ] said the MOIS will sometimes help assemble charges against defendants , direct cases to particular judges , and order judges to rule a particular way .
Structurally , he said the Revolutionary Courts are similar to other courts , fall under the Judiciary 's authority , and are theoretically supposed to follow the same law .
Defendants are allowed to have lawyers during their trials , can defend themselves , and can appeal decisions .
Asked about Roxanna Saberi , [ Name removed ] said he was aware of her case , but had no specific information on it .
Comment :
The Revolutionary Courts ' lack of transparency and seemingly baseless decision making make [ Name removed ] allegations plausible and perhaps probable .
[ Name removed ] work in the judiciary branch as a public prosecutor [ Location removed ] also gives his assertions some credibility , but he did not work in the Revolutionary Courts .
His accusations are more likely to reflect the legal community 's assumptions rather than first - hand knowledge of MOIS influence .
[ Name removed ] was also notable for the depth of his anti - regime sentiment , which probably colors his impressions of the Revolutionary Courts .

Mousavi 's Economic Program .
Moderate presidential candidate Mir Hussein Mousavi announced his economic program to the Iranian press this week , emphasizing economic growth and job creation from a rejuvenated and expanded private sector .
Mousavi criticized AN 's halting steps at privatization , calling them "" the institutionalization of non - productive government management . ""
Stability in government policies and a strict adherence to the planning documents of a restored Management and Planning Organization ( MPO ) and the "" rule of law , "" are other key planks .
The best talking point in the plan , "" social justice does n't mean equal distribution of poverty , "" challenges AN 's key economic goal by inserting economic growth into the equation and highlighting his poor economic management .
Mousavi 's plan only briefly mentions subsidy reforms , stressing the need to implement them gradually , after careful preparation .
Comment :
Mousavi 's plan mentions Article 44 of Iran 's constitution , which defines the role of the state , cooperative , and private sectors in Iran 's economy , but his emphasis on a strong private sector may open the plan to criticism that it is in conflict with the constitution .
Mousavi also threatens to withdraw Iran 's Fifth Five Year Development Plan , currently being drafted , if AN submits it to the Majles before the election .
An IRPO contact [ Source removed ] , did n't expect the plan to be finished until later this year .
4 .
( S / NF)[Name removed ] said Iran 's Ministry of Commerce has approved the creation of an Iran - Americas Chamber of Commerce in anticipation of improved US - Iran ties .
Although the chamber 's primary focus is the US , due to political sensitivities , it will not be called an Iran - US chamber .
[ Name removed ] made the following points : -- Khamenei instructed Ahmadinejad to base the Fifth Five Year Development Plan on a draft from the Expediency Council .
[ Name removed ] alleged that both the Expediency Council and the president submitted drafts of the plan to Khamenei and Khamenei favored the Expediency Council 's version . --
The current year will be positive for Iranian businesses .
[ Name removed ] admittedly in contrast with many of his colleagues , is optimistic because the election allows Iran the opportunity to remove Ahmadinejad and because he believes economic ties with the US will be a positive shock to the Iranian economy . --
Khamenei moderated his support for Ahmadinejad following Khatami 's decision to exit the contest .
[ Name removed ] predicts Mir Hossein Mousavi will win the election .
-- The TCC meetings are more productive than the ICCIM meetings .
The TCC has a monthly meeting with government representatives , including ministers ; the TCC members prepare for the meetings and , typically , complain a great deal during the meetings about government policy .
Although the government is not always responsive to their complaints , following a recent meeting , the oil minister appointed a committee to resolve the TCC 's concerns .
Participants in ICCIM meetings , which include representatives from the provincial chambers , are typically unprepared .
--Iranians seeking an export license must be a member of a chamber of commerce and both the Ministry of Commerce and a chamber must approve the export license .
Comment :
[ Name removed ] seems well placed to comment on economic and political developments in Iran .
However , his assertion that the Expediency Council submitted a draft of the next Five Year Development plan is unusual because normally the president 's office drafts the plan and submits it to the Majles .
The early involvement of the Expediency Council may reflect Rafsanjani 's concern over Ahmadinejad 's economic policies .
Khamenei in a letter to Ahmadinejad in January outlined the general policies to be included in the plan ; it is possible the letter is based on a plan from the Expediency Council .

( S / NF ) IRIG Suspicion Extends to Its Own Official Delegations :
[ Source removed ] hinted to IRPO local staff that official Iranian delegations can be scrutinized as much as exchange groups headed to the US .
[ Name removed ] implied that IRIG officials had carefully vetted members of the IMF delegation .
Separately , he told conoff , sotto voce , that the IRIG had only decided to allow some delegation members to travel two weeks ago , although their visa applications had been ready much earlier , and that was why they were late in applying .
Comment :
The delay in submitting the DUBAI 00000177 003.2 OF 003 visa applications may have been simple bureaucratic inefficiency , although [ Name removed ] indicated he strongly believed that security agencies were scrutinizing members of the delegation before permitting them to travel .

2010-11-28,"European Union ambassadors in Tehran jointly agreed to boycott the inauguration of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president after the disputed election in 2009 but kept the plan secret from the Iranian authorities to ensure their invitations were not withdrawn in advance .
France 's top Middle East official told US diplomats in Paris : "" It 's hard to keep a secret when 27 nations are involved but we are trying , "" according to a secret diplomatic cable In the end only Sweden , then running the EU presidency , was represented by an ambassador .
All other member states sent less senior officials .
But Jean - Christophe Paucelle sounded "" defensive "" when he explained that all EU envoys would still attend a separate inauguration ceremony in the Iranian parliament , admitting that the issue had generated "" tense and fractious "" debate among European foreign ministers .
"" We are caught between two conflicting objectives , "" Paucelle explained .
"" On the one hand we want to communicate that we do not approve of this illegitimate election .
On the other hand we need to be realistic : power is in the hands of ( supreme leader ) Khameini and Ahmadinejad , including the nuclear file , and we must negotiate with those in power .

The US has not had an embassy in Tehran since diplomatic relations were severed after the 1979 overthrow of the Shah and the Islamic revolution .
Paucelle said the EU would continue to respect what he described as "" the Durban red lines "" – dating back to the 2001 anti - racism conference in South Africa that had been hostile to Israel .
"" We will walk right out if Ahmadinejad denies the Holocaust or declares that his regime will destroy Israel . ""
Paucelle admitted that since non - Muslims had never before received an invitation to an inauguration ceremony presided over by Iran 's supreme leader , EU diplomats in Tehran had never entered the building where the event was to take place and were not sure about the practicalities of walking out if they needed to .
"" They are worried that the doors may be locked , "" he said .
The British ambassador , Simon Gass , also attended the 5 August parliamentary event , though as a recent arrival in Tehran he had not yet formally presented his diplomatic credentials .
"" The Iranians are desperate for recognition and so they have disregarded their usual devotion to protocol – and their anti - British vitriol – on this occasion , "" the French official reported ."

In a conversation today with Iran Watcher , a [ Source removed ] in Ashgabat labeled the announcement of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's victory in Friday 's presidential election a "" coup d'etat , "" and called Iran 's incumbent President "" another Pinochet . ""
[ Name removed ] said that based on calculations from Mousavi 's campaign observers who were present at polling stations around the country and who witnessed the vote counts , Mousavi received approximately 26 million ( or 61 % ) of the 42 million votes cast in Friday 's election , followed by Mehdi Karroubi ( 10 - 12 million ) .
According to his sources , Ahmadinejad received "" a maximum of 4 - 5 million votes , "" with the remainder going to Mohsen Rezai .
He said that more than anything else , the huge turnout of voters on Friday was a reflection of the Iranian electorate 's overwhelming "" anti - Ahmadinejad "" sentiments .
PRECINCT RESULTS OBSCURED 2 .
( C )
[ Name removed ] said that in a clear departure from established electoral rules and practice in Iran , including the procedures followed in the 2005 presidential election and last year 's legislative elections , the authorities embargoed the results from individual precincts and announced instead that they must be conveyed directly to the central election authorities , who would announce the overall results after all the votes were counted .
The Iranian authorities knew , he said , that attempts to falsify individual precinct counts could be countered by observers from the Mousavi and the other campaigns , so in order to engineer a "" lopsided "" Ahmadinejad victory , they had no choice but to conceal the precinct results .
In his words , "" People know who they voted for and the observers know who won in each precinct . ""

Even Supreme Leader Khamenei , he said , to whom the IRGC owes allegiance , is "" not totally in control "" of the IRGC .

European Union members will send low - ranking diplomats to the first of two inauguration ceremonies for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , but they will not inform the Iranians of their plans , according to French MFA Acting Middle East Director ( Assistant - Secretary equivalent ) Jean - Christophe Paucelle .
If the Iranians find out beforehand that the EU will not send Ambassador - level representation , Paucelle told poloff early July 31 , then they may rescind the invitations to the August 3 event , as they did in similar circumstances prior to former President Khatami 's inauguration in 1997 .
"" It 's hard to keep a secret when 27 nations are involved , "" Paucelle noted , "" but we are trying . ""

Paucelle said that the case of detained French citizen Clothilde Reiss has also influenced the EU decision to attend the inauguration ceremonies .

He reported that the French have reason to believe Reiss may form part of a group of detainees likely to be released on the August 7 anniversary of Imam Mahdi .
Paucelle noted that a letter released July 29 by Ahmadinejad supported the idea of granting clemency to post - election protesters during Mahdi celebrations . ""
The Iranians will need to take face - saving measures , and so she will likely transfer to house arrest or some other status , "" Paucelle said .
He added that , of course , she may not be released at all next week , but the French remain optimistic that she will soon be out of prison .
PEKALA"
2010-11-29,"Iran today lashed out at the WikiLeaks revelations , with the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , dismissing the controversial leaks as a "" worthless "" psychological warfare campaign against his country .
But Israel said it felt vindicated by the public exposure of Arab and international concern over Iran 's nuclear programme .
"" We do n't think this information was leaked , "" the Iranian president insisted during a televised press conference in Tehran . ""
We think it was organised to be released on a regular basis and they are pursuing political goals . ""
Ahmadinejad told reporters that documents highlighting Arab hostility to Iran and its alleged nuclear ambitions would have no impact .
"" We are friends with the regional countries and mischievous acts will not affect relations , "" he said .
Iranian media commented that the US does not trust its "" agents "" inside the Islamic republic and claimed there were US links to the mass protests and unrest that followed last year 's disputed presidential election .
Press TV , the English - language Iranian TV channel , also highlighted evidence from the state department cables that US diplomats are apparently engaged in espionage – a charge that will hold special resonance in a country where the long - empty US embassy is still routinely referred to as "" the nest of spies "" .
Arab governments maintained a discreet silence but Arabic - language media highlighted Guardian reports that Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in particular had advocated military action against Iran to stop its nuclear programme . ""
The Arabs agitated against Iran , "" the Qatar - based al - Jazeera TV headlined its main story .
Its rival , the Saudi - owned al - Arabiya , initially made no reference to King Abdullah 's call to attack Iran "" to cut off the head of the snake "" or to similarly hawkish comments by King Hamad of Bahrain , but later changed its story to include these .
The Saudi paper Okaz zoomed in on warnings by the British government that the massive leak could endanger lives .
Other Arab media headlined stories focusing on Israel 's ability to attack Iran as well as Tehran 's acquisition of long - range missiles .
The Saudi Gazette reported the WikiLeaks story but without mentioning the kingdom .
In Abu Dhabi , capital of the UAE , where the crown prince , Mohammed bin Zayed al - Nahyan , was reported by US officials as having made bellicose remarks about Iran , the English - language paper The National did not report a local link to the WikiLeaks story .
In Israel , the prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , claimed vindication for the view that Iran constitutes the biggest regional threat and that its development of a nuclear capacity must be halted .
Despite anxiety in the runup to publication that the US embassy cables could cast Israel in a negative light , he said : "" Israel has not been damaged at all by the WikiLeaks publications .
On the contrary , the documents showed support in many quarters for Israel 's assessments , especially on Iran .
"" Our region has been hostage to a narrative that is the result of 60 years of propaganda , which paints Israel as the greatest threat , "" Netanyahu added .
"" In reality leaders understand that that view is bankrupt .
For the first time in history there is agreement that Iran is the threat . ""
Many leaders and governments in the Middle East understood the threat , he said , though the documents revealed "" a gap between what is said publicly and what is said behind closed doors "" .
Several Israeli commentators suggested that US attempts to get the stalled Israeli - Palestinian talks back on track will be put on hold while the administration concentrates on a damage - limitation exercise .
Iranian media failed to widely report mention of a 2009 diplomatic cable reporting that supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has terminal cancer .
But one website , alef.ir , which is a website affiliated to the Revolutionary Guards , focused on suggestions of US links with Iranians protesting at the outcome of the 2009 presidential election .
"" The interesting parts of this document are those which show that the rioters in the aftermath of the election are linked to the American diplomatic service and they have been consulted by them , "" it said ."
2010-12-01,"Revelations that some Arab countries called on the US to take military action against Iran and that Mossad planned to harness minority and student groups to overthrow the Iranian regime may come as a surprise to many , but not to one man ( Chilling fears of ' different world ' if Iran develops nuclear arsenal , 29 November ) .
Indeed , in Tehran , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will be stroking his beard sagely and saying : "" I told you so . ""
Ahmadinejad has long believed those around him are , with the support of the Great Satan , out to get him .
The WikiLeaks documents will strengthen his mistrust of his regional neighbours and his crackdown against ethnic groups such as the Azeris , Kurds and Baluchs will be intensified .
Even his brutal suppression of the Green movement and student democracy groups will receive some form of retrospective justification .
Iran 's nuclear enrichment programme is a point of great national pride , and Iranians ' dislike of foreign interference is intense .
The CIA 's involvement in the overthrow of their prime minister in 1953 is still fresh in their memory , as is the bloody eight - year war against US - backed Iraq in the 1980s .
These leaked communications will strengthen Ahmadinejad 's position within his country .
They will also increase Iran 's sense of isolation and persecution .
Ahmadinejad 's mistrust of those around him will be heightened and Iran will become more intolerant of dissent within its borders and more difficult to negotiate with on the international stage .
As demonstrated by North Korea last week , when a nation comes to be seen as a pariah state , its behaviour can become increasingly irrational , unpredictable or even violent .

In your article ( Motorcycle bombers mount co - ordinated attacks on nuclear scientists in Iran , 29 November ) there is a list of possible perpetrators , of which Israel leads the field .
Given that the recent WikiLeaks reports reveal that the Arab states have been the most insistent on action to stop the Iranian nuclear project , I am surprised that they feature nowhere as possible instigators .

If all our emails , however personal , are to become subject to the scrutiny of the government , why should n't all the government 's emails , however sensitive , become subject to the scrutiny of us ?
If we ca n't plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament without their knowledge , why can they and Saudi Arabia plot to blow up Iran without ours ?

The benefit of WikiLeaks to foreign and other policies of various states is that they may lead to less hypocrisy .
We all understand unscripted comments , but we also expect them to be consistentwith the formal public policy and not their opposite .
Such outing can only be beneficial to public understanding .
Gerard McMullan London • Barack Obama is reported to have criticised the leaks and his press secretary calls them "" a criminal act "" ( White House hits back at ' criminal act and attack on US ' , 30 November ) .
What a volte - face since Obama took office .

The work of Prince Andrew in promoting UK trade with the former Soviet Union should not be underestimated , and I hope the recent WikiLeaks disclosures will not discourage him ( Corrupt French , nosy journalists , idiotic bribery investigators : The world according to Andrew , 30 November ) .

2010-12-01,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has dismissed the WikiLeaks revelations of Arab hostility to Iran as worthless "" psychological warfare "" .
But the idea that 250,000-plus pages of classified US documents actually shed any new light on Middle Eastern realities has also been widely dismissed by many Arabs or simply ignored by their governments .
In Riyadh , where King Abdullah was shown to have repeatedly urged the US to attack Iran to "" cut off the head of the snake "" , the only official reaction has been to say sniffily that the documents "" do not concern the kingdom of Saudi Arabia , nor does the kingdom have any role in producing them , nor is it aware of their authenticity "" .
Mainstream Arab media have covered the story of the leak .
But little attention has been paid to the most sensational aspect of it for the region – that Saudis , Bahrainis , Emiratis and other leaders repeatedly urged the US to strike Iran to stop its nuclear programme .
Many have wondered , however , why Israel appears to have escaped any damaging exposure – and hinted at an improbably vast conspiracy to deceive .
It is true of course that Arab governments enjoy little popular support and that Arab public opinion tends to favour a strong Iran , even a nuclear - armed Iran , as a counterweight to Israel and to US hegemony .
That explains why hawkish comments about Persians or pragmatism about Israel are expressed largely in private .
Public candour is rare .
So even al - Jazeera , the freest media outlet in the Arab world , has been coy about reporting on the indiscretions of the emir of Qatar ( whose family owns the Doha - based satellite channel ) , who is shown to speak frankly to US interlocutors about telling lies to Iran .
"" It is a very sensitive story , "" admits one employee .
Also in Qatar , the Peninsula newspaper quoted psychologist Dr Mozah al Malki as saying : "" It is all deliberate .
We can clearly see through the ploy .
The idea of the so - called leaks is to further intensify tension between Iran and the Gulf Co - operation Council countries . ""
According to the paper : "" The so - called exposé by the much - touted whistleblowing website WikiLeaks involving Iran and three GCC states does not have many takers in Qatar . ""
Other Gulf papers simply ignored details about their rulers ' comments to American interlocutors .
Rami Khouri , a syndicated columnist , found the revelations sad , shocking and even pitiful : "" The assorted Arab leaders who are quoted as asking the United States to hurry up and do something about Iran 's growing nuclear technology capabilities reveal an apparent inability to take care of their own countries and citizens , "" he wrote in Beirut'sDaily Star .
The splenetic Asa'd Abu Khalil , who writes the Angry Arab blog , noted that many Arabs on Twitter and Facebook have been raising questions about WikiLeaks because the revelations about the Middle East were largely either known or expected .
"" Some are noticing that nothing damaging to Israel – even diplomatically – has been released .
Some are suggesting that the US government is behind WikiLeaks .
Personally , I discount those conspiracy theories although conspiracy theories can be helpful . ""
But then he asks : "" Is it possible that the intelligence officer who released them protected Israel by holding off on some documents ? ""
Another critical note about the revelations was sounded by the pan - Arab paper al - Quds al - Arabi , edited by the Palestinian Abdel - Bari Atwan , who splashed the Saudi - Iran story on Monday and wrote an editorial demanding an explanation of the Saudi position .
But others suggested the impact of the WikiLeaks row would in the end be negligible : "" Citizens of the Arab world , and in particular the Arabian Gulf , will not be very surprised at the content of most of these leaks , "" commented Zaid Derweesh .
"" They know that what is said in public by their leaders differs greatly from what goes on behind closed doors .
They also know that their governments will go along with whatever the US asks of them .
What may come as a surprise to some will be the degree to which this subservience occurs . """
2010-12-05,"Negotiations on Iran 's nuclear programme restart in Geneva tomorrow in the shadow of the WikiLeaks revelations , a significant portion of which deals with aspects of US policy towards Iran and the views , interests and concerns of regional powers .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been quick to dismiss the leaks as a deliberate attempt "" psychologically "" to undermine Iran 's rising regional position .
There is indeed much which simply reflects the systematic collection of speculation .
Take the suggestion that Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Khamenei , was chronically ill , in effect on his deathbed .
Rumours about Khamenei 's health have been around for some time , and while this may reflect thinking in particular circles , it can not be read as a statement of fact .
The documents also provide an insight into the machinery of the State Department 's information - gathering on Iran , that by all accounts appears to have been a good deal more comprehensive and thorough than some may have appreciated .
Moreover , as any policymaker knows , it is important to get under the skin of your interlocutor , to absorb and understand perspectives and mindsets not only of the decision - makers but the wider elite and , in Iran 's case , the public at large .
For all the bravado characteristic of Ahmadinejad , what these documents reveal is more acute awareness of the realities of Iranian domestic politics in the aftermath of the election crisis of 2009 than had perhaps been appreciated .
On one level , therefore , these documents reveal the depth of distrust and anxiety within the region towards Iran .
It was an open secret that the Saudis were contemptuous of Ahmadinejad , though these documents add flesh to the bones .
More perturbing perhaps has been the depth of animosity that exists within most Arab governments , including those on the Persian Gulf .
Apart from the anxiety itself is the manner in which it is defined – largely on ethnic rather than sectarian grounds – and the striking fact that the Americans , far from egging on the Arabs , appear to be resisting the temptation of exercising the military option .
This has been ascribed by some to the indecision of Barack Obama , or more pertinently as a reaction to reckless adventurism of the Bush administration .
But another influencing factor may be a more nuanced appreciation of the complexities of the political and economic crisis in Iran .
The animosity of Arab leaders is matched , and by all accounts exceeded , by the antagonism of Iranians towards their own leadership .
A variety of sources suggested early on that what had happened in effect on 12 June 2009 was a coup d'état .
Dispiritingly , one dispatch records widespread disillusion at the lack of immediate condemnation by the international community .
All is not well with the Islamic Republic of Iran as it heads into a new round of negotiations and their prolongation is not to Iran 's advantage , as one Chinese analyst appears to have acknowledged .
As the west inches out of economic crisis , Iran 's political and economic woes increase .
Not that this would worry Ahmadinejad , for whom Iran is a model democracy happy to share its experiences with the wider world .
His world view is not difficult to discern , obsessed as he is with the global conspiracy set to obstruct Iran on its triumphant way to superpower status .
Perhaps some in the Arab world have swallowed the rhetoric ; many more , particularly in the west , remain sceptical .
Political myths are powerful determinants of behaviour , yet if Ahmadinejad paid attention he might realise his difficulties are real and immediate , and that in many ways , US animosity is the least of his problems .

2010-12-15,"It is now more than three years since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made his famous claim during a visit to New York : "" In Iran we do n't have homosexuals like you do in your country .
This does not exist in our country . ""
His words caused laughter among the audience at Columbia University but – unintentionally on Ahmadinejad 's part – they have probably done more than anything else to raise awareness in the west of the problems faced by sexual minorities in Iran .
Unfortunately , the LGBT issue – epitomised by the notorious photograph of two male teenagers being hanged – has also been embraced unscrupulously by some , in the hope of bolstering support for a military attack which has entirely different goals and motives .
This , in turn , leads to accusations from the other side that anyone who complains about the treatment of LGBT people is simply picking on Iran and trying to start a war .
Regardless of motives , though , it 's a fact that Iran 's treatment of sexual minorities is bad and , by international standards , somewhere near the bottom of the league .
It is one of only seven countries worldwide that retains the death penalty for consensual same - sex acts ( the others are Mauritania , Saudi Arabia , Yemen , Sudan and some parts of Somalia and Nigeria ) .
But disappointingly for those who like to keep things ultra - simple , the picture is not uniformly black .
Small numbers of Iranians ( mainly in the middle and upper classes ) identify themselves as gay or lesbian , and some are surprisingly open about it .
There are also embryonic LGBT communities in major cities , such as Tehran , Esfahan , and Shiraz , with well - known cafes , restaurants and parks that serve as meeting places .
Despite what Ahmadinejad says about their non - existence , gay men get official recognition of sorts when it comes to military service .
They can claim exemption on grounds of "" behavioural disorder "" or "" sexual deviancy "" ( without admitting to ever having sex , of course ) – and many do .
They may be quite pleased about avoiding the military , though of course it 's a form of discrimination and the downside is that having "" sexual deviant "" on their exemption certificate is likely to prevent them from getting a job .
Iran has also been something of a pioneer in the field of gender reassignment operations , which might count in its favour – except that gay men who are not transgendered can be pressurised into having operations in order to avoid punishment .
All this has led to a lot of arguments about what the LGBT situation in Iran is really like – an argument that has n't been helped , up to now , by a lack of detailed or reliable information .
A report issued today by Human Rights Watch , running to 102 pages and based on testimony from more than 100 Iranians , goes a long way towards remedying that problem .
One thing it makes very clear is that the persecution of sexual minorities in Iran is not just the fault of the regime : it happens in homes , schools and society at large – though of course the law helps to reinforce these attitudes .
On the vexed question of how many gay or lesbian people are actually executed , the report does not commit itself , though it does explain why it 's so difficult to arrive at an accurate figure .
One reason is that trials on moral charges in Iran are usually held in private and the regime , conscious of the international outrage that its executions cause , tightly controls press reporting of the death penalty .
Also , Human Rights Watch says , "" the conservative nature of Iranian society and the shame associated with homosexuality ( and non - conforming sexual or gender expression generally ) often complicate any inquiry into whether the individual charged is actually an LGBT person "" .
A further complication is that Iranians who have been convicted of lavat ( sodomy ) and then executed have rarely , if ever , been charged solely with that crime .
The report continues : "" In most cases the court also convicted them on other charges , some of which carry the death penalty …
In several notable death - penalty cases during the past decade , the government charged defendants with a variety of sexual crimes warranting the death penalty , including , for example , sodomy , adultery , or rape .
In at least some cases , Iranian prosecutors have included serious moral or sex charges when prosecuting individuals primarily for political reasons .
"" Iranian law does not target LGBT people per se ; it criminalises all sexual relations outside traditional marriage , though the report says that in practice the law is applied disproportionately to Iran 's sexual minorities .
The punishments are severe .
Lavat is punishable by death where a judge determines that penetration was involved .
For lesser "" crimes "" there 's flogging .
Tafkhiz ( frottage ) is punishable by 100 lashes for each partner ( with death for a fourth conviction ) .
"" Lustful "" kissing between two men or two women is punishable by up to 60 lashes , while if two men or two women who are "" not related by blood are found naked under the same cover without any necessity "" each will receive up to 99 lashes .
The punishment for women convicted of lesbianism , or mosaheqeh , is 100 lashes , with death for a fourth conviction .
Regardless of whether such acts ought to be treated as crimes in the first place , correct application of Iranian law should make it very difficult to convict anyone – at least in theory .
Securing a conviction requires four "" righteous men "" to testify that they have witnessed the act ( highly unlikely unless it 's done in public in broad daylight ) .
Alternatively , it requires four confessions by the accused in front of a judge ( again unlikely unless the confession is forced , and even then there 's scope for a pardon if the accused repents ) or , finally , a ruling based on the judge 's "" knowledge "" ( which is supposedly derived from evidence and not just a personal belief that the accused looks guilty ) .
In practice , though , "" those charged with engaging in consensual same - sex offences stand little chance of receiving a fair trial "" , Human Rights Watch says .
Judges "" often rely instead on confessions extracted through physical torture and extreme psychological pressure "" , while the "" judge 's knowledge "" provision "" makes it easy in practice for a judge 's individual prejudices toward a defendant 's appearance or demeanour [ to ] sway his rulings "" ."

Classified By :
Ambassador David Mulford for Reasons 1.4 ( B and D ) 1 .
( C ) Summary :
Foreign Secretary Shivshankar Menon related to the Ambassador May 1 that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told the Prime Minister during his April 29 stop in Delhi that the world is changing in Iran 's favor .
When asked for specifics , Menon noted , Ahmadinejad voiced more mild opinions , and called for strengthening the governments in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Regarding the Iran - Pakistan - India pipeline , Menon said that the Prime Minister laid down three criteria that would determine whether India signed a deal with Iran : commercial and economic viability , assured supply , and security .
Menon confided that Ahmadinejad concocted the widely reported 45-day window for negotiating the pipeline when he talked to the press on his way to the airport , and Menon doubted that the countries would resolve the outstanding pipeline issues anytime soon .
The Ambassador underlined that senior leaders in the U.S.
Congress will likely criticize India for giving a platform to the leader of a country engaged in killing American soldiers in Iraq , developing nuclear weapons with which to blackmail other countries , and sponsoring terrorism worldwide .
End Summary .
- - - Ahmadinejad Broadly Ideological But Mild on Specifics - - - 2 .
( C ) Foreign Secretary Shivshankar Menon related to the Ambassador May 1 that he wanted to provide a briefing of the April 29 "" transit stop "" in Delhi by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
( Note : Menon had originally requested the meeting on the evening of April 30 , but rescheduled when the Prime Minister summoned Menon to his residence .
End Note . )
Menon outlined that , after landing at the airport at 16:30 , Ahmadinejad met the Indian President for 45 minutes , followed by a meeting and dinner with the Prime Minister , in which Menon participated .
During the meeting with the Prime Minister , Menon related , Ahmadinejad described a world that has improved from Iran 's point of view , and would continue to shift in Iran 's favor .
Menon admitted that "" I had not realized how ideological Ahmadinejad is . ""
He noted that while Ahmadinejad did not attack the U.S. explicitly , he opined that the U.S. has destabilized Iraq and would withdraw soon .
When asked about specifics , Menon continued , Ahmadinejad became "" relatively mild . ""
Regarding Afghanistan , Ahmadinejad noted that there was no alternative to Hamid Karzai and called for strengthening the government in Kabul , and regarding Iraq , he called for greater law and order , but considered the Maliki government good .
"" There was no fire and brimstone in the details , "" Menon observed .

Down Criteria for Pipeline - - - 3 .
( C ) Menon said that the discussion with the Prime Minister focused on the Iran - Pakistan - India ( IPI ) pipeline , and Ahmadinejad made clear that he aimed to produce an agreement in Delhi .
However , the Prime Minister laid down that India required more detailed discussions to obtain three conditions that would allow India to sign up to the IPI : commercial and economic viability , assured supply , and security of the pipeline .
Ahmadinejad gave his word that the pipeline would satisfy those conditions , and asked that Indian leaders trust him .
He then agreed to more detailed discussions , but to commence within a month .
"" We said no to artificial deadlines , "" Menon stressed to the Ambassador .
Ahmadinejad later told the press that the countries have 45 days to work out an agreement , but Menon maintained , "" I do n't know where he got that number from , but his goal in India was to say that . ""
( Note : Menon has not corrected Ahmadinejad 's statement in public .
End Note . )
"" We made clear that our issues are more than just the price of a transaction , "" he underlined , averred that it would take a long time to resolve the conditions set out by the Indian government .

( C )
Regarding Iran 's nuclear program , Menon related that Ahmadinejad reiterated his public points that Iran intended the program for peaceful use .
Menon said that the Prime Minister acknowledged Iran 's right to a peaceful nuclear program , but urged Ahmadinejad to assure the international community of its peaceful intentions by coming clean with the IAEA , which Iran has not done .
Ahmadinejad also made clear that the uranium enrichment program would continue , Menon added .
India 's votes against Iran in the IAEA did not come up , he continued .
Menon thanked the Ambassador for the April 27 briefing prior to Ahmadinejad 's arrival , and enthusiastically remarked that he found it "" very useful . ""
- - - Ahmadinejad Performed in Delhi - - - 5 .
( C ) Menon puzzled about Ahmadinejad 's "" self - congratulatory , self - referential "" style , which he found particularly odd during an exchange about oil prices , during which Ahmadinejad bragged that the cost of oil would remain high .
Ahmadinejad also bad - mouthed other countries , including China , which he claimed had put all its money in U.S. dollars and now had nothing left .
As a result , Menon judged , "" we assume he speaks badly about us to other countries .
"" Menon also noted that Ahmadinejad refrained from direct attacks on Israel , and did not bring up the Indian launch of an Israeli satellite nor the U.S .- India relationship .
Overall , Menon assessed , Ahmadinejad appeared to have performed in Delhi for his domestic audience , showing Iranian voters that he can still travel and interact with other countries .

( C )
The Ambassador underlined that Americans , particularly members of Congress , will view Ahmadinejad 's visit as India providing a platform for an enemy of the U.S. Members of Congress and the Administration strongly believe that Ahmadinejad is guilty of killing Americans in Iraq , developing a nuclear weapons program to blackmail the world , and sponsoring international terrorist activities , the Ambassador outlined .
Moreover , the U.S. has maintained a long - term alliance with Israel , which Ahmadinejad has called for "" wiping off the face of the earth , "" the Ambassador added .
The average American will wonder why the U.S. has gone out of its way to have a nuclear cooperation initiative with India , when India is so friendly to Iran , he warned .
"" I can not predict what the effect of this visit will be , "" he cautioned , but noted that he expected the Ahmadinejad stop to exercise those members of Congress who have gone out of their way on India 's behalf .
- - - Nothing
Should Upset You , Menon Presses - - - 7 .
( C ) Menon responded that "" there is nothing in this visit that should upset you . ""
He emphasized that the Indian government had little choice to say yes when the Iranian government requested a stop in transit .
Moreover , Menon explained , India and Iran need to talk about Afghanistan and energy issues .
"" We can talk with him without affecting our other relationships , "" Menon contended , and cited the strong India - Israel relationship that withstood India 's flirtation with Iran .
Menon also cautioned the U.S. against telling India what to do , especially in public . ""
This government has to be seen following an independent foreign policy , not responding to dictation from the U.S. , "" he stated .
He recognized that Iran presents a global problem , and the U.S. and India differ in how to fix the situation because of geography .
For instance , Menon pressed , India must work with Iran to deal with Afghanistan .

( C )
The Ambassador recounted that the U.S. government and Congress stood up for India by passing the Hyde Act because they believed that as a rising power , India must come into the global nonproliferation system .
However , the Ambassador posited , those supporters will wonder if India is ready for prime time since it "" let the enemy in and did not stand up and say , ' do n't do this . '
"" Menon countered that such a position sounded like what the Communists have accused the U.S. of doing .
The Ambassador clarified that the Communists suspect the Indian and U.S. governments of trading foreign policies in a clandestine cabal , when in this case , the Ambassador simply wished to make the Indian government aware of the possible repercussions that come from hosting the hostile Ahmadinejad .

Needs No U.S. Interference - - - 9 .
( C ) By providing Ahmadinejad with a platform to berate the U.S.
, the Indian government has attempted to prove that it has an independent foreign policy , as the Communist critics have demanded since India 's first vote against Iran in the IAEA in 2005 .
By kowtowing to political concerns , India has put at risk its image of an emerging , responsible major player in the world .
We have warned the Indian government quietly about the implications , but sharp , public comments from the U.S. government will only push India and Iran closer together .
MULFORD"
2010-12-21,"On Sunday the government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad introduced a subsidies reform package in Iran .
Subsidies on major food and energy commodities will be reduced .
At the same time , the government will provide monthly cash payments , depending on the income of each family .
On average , each Iranian will receive $ 40 ( £ 25 ) per month .
Most of those who will get these cash payments belong to the lower income brackets of society and the goal of the handouts is to help them cope with the loss of subsidies .
On the surface , this plan may seem sensible .
After all , the IMF and the World Bank have all been calling for state subsidies to be reduced around the world .
However , beneath the surface all is not well .
The method by which Ahmadinejad is implementing the reform package , plus its timing , means that the regime could be about to bring in one of the most self - defeating measures in its history .
In fact , the package could cause more damage to the legitimacy of the regime , and its all - important economic engine , than any western - imposed sanctions .
This is because the scheme is very likely to hurt the poor , where the regime gets most of its support .
The damage could also reach all the way to the top .
The group that stands to lose the most will be the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp ( IRGC ) .
The reason is simple : upon closer inspection , we can see that the package is badly planned and executed .
One of its major short- and long - term consequences is that it is going to push inflation up , for two reasons .
Number one , the scheme includes cash handouts .
One of the reasons why Iran already suffers from relatively high inflation of 10.8 % ( unofficially it is thought to be 20 % ) is because of Ahmadinejad 's existing cash handouts to the poor and cheap , quick loans given to businesses .
The amount of cash circulating in the economy is now about to get another major boost through more handouts via the subsidy reforms package .
There is also the fact that when you reduce subsidies , prices go up .
It has already been reported that the price of bread has increased .
However , one area that could lead to serious damage to the economy is the price of diesel .
As of Sunday , the Iranian government increased its price from 1.6c to 15c a litre – a 900 % increase .
It is envisaged that soon this will increase to 35c .
Imagine that you are running a haulage or a food transportation company .
With such a sudden increase in your fuel costs , you are going to have to increase the amount you charge per mile .
The only way you can do this is by charging your customer , the food producer and the consumer .
The problem then arises when the cash handout from the government to help cope with the loss of subsidies is nowhere near the 900 % increase in fuel costs .
This means that sooner or later demand could take a massive hit .
Consumers will have to start consuming less and producers producing less , because it is no longer affordable .
The brunt of this sudden fall in demand will be felt by the IRGC 's huge business empire , which these days produces everything from tomato purée to car parts .
The organisation also runs a massive smuggling network .
Even though the government may support it by giving it cheap fuel , the purchasing capability of its customers is going to take a major hit .
And it could get worst , if this malaise reaches the Tehran Stock Exchange ( TSE ) , which over the last six months has climbed 4,000 points to 18,000 points .
Some of the biggest companies listed on this exchange belong to the IRGC .
The government has so far managed to keep the index artificially high .
However , increasing inflation from the subsidies reform plan and the expected reduction in demand for goods could force the market to readjust .
A sudden crash could have a severe impact on domestic stability because some of the shareholders in the TSE are poor people , as per the government 's article 44 privatisation plan , under which shares were offered to those on a low income at a heavy discount .
Another factor that makes economic and social damage much more probable is the sudden manner in which the reform package was introduced and implemented .
Had the changes been implemented more gradually , they could have been easier for the consumers and producers to absorb .
The Iranian government may not care much about its own public .
However , the IRGC , with its massive business interests and increasing say in the country 's domestic security and the nuclear programme , will be harder to ignore .
Iran 's supreme leader , Ali Khamenei , may not care much about the public either , but he should hope for the sake of the IRGC that Ahmadinejad has disaster recovery plans ."
2011-02-08,"Iran 's opposition has called for renewed street protests next week on the back of the wave of demonstrations that have swept across the Middle East .
Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , the leaders of the green movement in Iran , have issued a call for what they have described as "" a solidarity move to support the protests in two Muslim countries of Egypt and Tunisia "" on Monday .
The green movement staged a series of mass demonstrations for several weeks in 2009 , following a disputed presidential election that gave Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a second term in office .
Tehran and other major cities saw the biggest popular uprising in the history of the Islamic Republic .
In a joint letter addressed to Iran 's interior minister , Mustafa Mohammad Najjar , Mousavi and Karroubi have asked permission to stage a march from Imam Hossein Square to Azadi ( or Freedom ) Square in central Tehran .
On his official website , Mousavi has likened the protests in Egypt and Tunisia to those in Iran in 2009 . ""
Undoubtedly , the starting point of what we are witnessing in the streets of Tunis , Sana'a , Cairo , Alexandria and Suez should be seen in the Iranian protests , "" he said .
"" The Middle East is on the threshold of great events these days that could affect the fate of the region and the world . "" .
Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has hailed the Egyptian uprising and said that it was inspired by the Islamic revolution in 1979 .
"" Today 's events in the north of Africa , Egypt , Tunisia and certain other countries have another sense for the Iranian nation .
They have special meaning .
This is the same Islamic awakening which resulted in the victory of the big revolution of the Iranian nation , "" he was quoted by the IRNA state news agency as saying at his Friday prayer sermon last week .
It is unlikely that Ahmadinejad 's government will give permission for the opposition protest , but the leaders of the green movement are using the request to reach out to the public .
Iran 's constitution allows for peaceful demonstrations .
The call has been welcomed by Iran 's huge online community , which has already started to promote it via social networking websites and in blogs .
Flyers and posters are being designed by anonymous supporters of the green movement who have distributed them among internet users .
On Friday Tehran will stage a pro - government demonstration to mark the 32nd anniversary of the Islamic revolution ."
2011-03-08,"Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , Iran 's former president and one of its most influential politicians , has abandoned his position as the head of a powerful clerical body charged with appointing and dismissing the supreme leader .
The move came after hardliners sympathetic to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ran a significant campaign in recent weeks calling for Rafsanjani , a moderate supporter of Iran 's opposition Green movement , to be replaced .
Rafsanjani served as the chairman of the assembly of experts since 2006 , but withdrew his candidacy for re - election on Tuesday .
Some analysts believe that Rafsanjani decided to step aside to avoid embarrassment had he failed to win the assembly 's election but others assert that he was ordered by the supreme leader to do so . ""
Since 2006 he has been elected as the head of the assembly every two years
and I think he was really keen to run this time as well
but I believe he had a hint from the supreme leader to step aside , "" Meir Javedanfar , an expert of Iranian politics said .
Iran 's opposition speculated that criticism from his own supporters over his failure to determine the fate of disappeared opposition leaders might have been another factor in his decision .
Opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi have not been seen in public since they were placed under house arrest following a renewed protest in mid - February .
Rafsanjani said in a speech at the assembly that he stepped aside to "" avoid division "" and instead voiced support for the candidacy of Ayatollah Mohammad Reza Mahdavi Kani .
Kani , the sole candidate , succeeded him .
"" I regard division at the assembly as detrimental ... I had said before that should Mahdavi Kani stand for the position , I would withdraw to prevent any rift , "" Rafsanjani was quoted by Iran 's state ISNA news agency as saying .
The performance of the assembly of experts has been criticised in recent years by pro - opposition political activists who believe it failed to hold Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accountable for the violence used in Iran during the 2009 post - election unrest which left many protesters dead .
Those activists believe that the assembly has become what they call "" flatterers of supreme leader "" rather than a body to monitor him .
Rafsanjani still holds the position of head of Iran 's expediency council , which arbitrates between the parliament and the guardian council , a body that vets all candidates who participate in various elections in Iran .
The 77-year - old is believed to have played an instrumental role in the appointment of Khamenei as the current supreme leader after the death of the founder of the Islamic revolution , Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989 .
Rafsanjani 's reputation was damaged in the past decade by widespread allegations among regime and opposition supporters that he and his family were financially corrupt .
However , Rafsanjani 's mediatory power as a moderate politician , which was seen as crucial for the survival of the regime , began to wane when he lost to Ahmadinejad in the 2005 presidential election and as Ahmadinejad won more support from the supreme leader .
Rafsanjani faced unprecedented criticism from Ahmadinejad supporters after he tactically voiced support for the opposition following the disputed presidential election in 2009 .
His power has faded rapidly since then .
On Saturday , Mohsen Hashemi , one of Rafsanjani 's sons , resigned under pressure from Ahmadinejad 's government as the head of Tehran 's metro organisation .
Rafsanjani 's daughter , Faezeh was briefly arrested last month in Tehran pro - opposition protests on 20 February .
An arrest warrant has also been issued for Rafsanjani 's other son , Mehdi , who has lived in Britain for the past two years ."
2011-04-21,"A close ally of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who favours cultural openness and opposes greater clerical involvement in politics , is being groomed as a possible successor to the Iranian president when he steps down in two years time .
Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , Ahmadinejad 's chief - of - staff , is positioning himself as a candidate who will champion a nationalist rather than a theological narrative of Iran .
Mashaei , whose daughter married Ahmadinejad 's son , has become the most controversial political figure in Iran , provoking harsh criticism from the conservative establishment , including the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Hardliners close to Khamenei have accused Mashaei of compromising the Islamic Revolution and the principles of Islam by focusing on Persian history .
Mashaei infuriated conservatives in 2008 when he said that Iranians are "" friends of all people in the world – even Israelis "" .
He was also criticised for applauding at a ceremony in Turkey in which women performed a traditional dance .
Women are not allowed to dance in Iran .
Mashaei used to head Iran 's cultural heritage organisation .
He was appointed first vice - president in 2009 when Ahmadinejad resumed office following disputed elections that generated mass protests .
But he was forced to step down when Khamenei intervened and said in a letter to the president that "" the regime 's expediency "" required Mashaei to leave his post .
Ahmadinejad appointed Mashaei as chief - of - staff instead , a move seen by many as a blow to Khamenei and the first sign of split emerging between the president and the supreme leader .
A confidential US diplomatic cable revealed by WikiLeaks said the incident underlined Mashaei 's significance in Ahmadinejad 's team . ""
Ahmadinejad 's stubborn defence of Mashaei bespeaks his importance as a key adviser for the increasingly isolated president ; he also has emerged as a spokesman for the Ahmadinejad administration .
Ahmadinejad has even told press that he would gladly serve as vice - president in a Mashaei administration , prompting many to speculate that Ahmadinejad seeks to have Mashaei replace him in 2013 , "" the cable reads .
Some analysts believe that a regime which has crushed the green opposition movement and is short of internal opposition , is merely creating one in order to create a show of legitimacy come the next election .
Hooshang Amirahmadi , the president of the American Iranian Council who knows Mashaei , told the Guardian : "" The reformist movement in Iran did not succeed for various reasons .
I think Mashaei has become another alternative and the regime is using this opportunity to heat up the next election in Iran .
Mashaei is saying that Iranians are at first Iranians and Islam comes afterward . ""
He is reviving a source of national pride of Iranians , something that has been neglected not only since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 but in the past two centuries . ""
Amirahmadi said : "" After the revolution , an extensive obsession with Islam made the authorities neglect Iran 's history and Mashaei is now seeking to promote this sort of nationalistic narrative .
I think Ahmadinejad himself is also in favour of Iran 's history and has sought to revive Iran 's ancient glory and power . ""
Iranians are proud of their history and still largely celebrate many ancient traditions that goes back as far as the country 's Zoroastrian era , such as the Persian new year , Nowruz .
Mashaei is also believed to have played a crucial role in securing the loan from the British Museum of the Cyrus Cylinder .
The artefact , considered the first human rights charter , was seen by a million visitors in Tehran during its six - month exhibition , although hardliners and clerics largely boycotted the event .
The relic was returned to the UK last week .
"" Obviously Mashaei 's nationalistic views are a threat to clerics .
They are afraid that their power might wane if people begin to respect their pre - Islamic history , "" Amirahmadi said .
Mashaei , whose name has been touted among political activists as a possible 2013 candidate , has not ruled out the possibility of running for president , recently telling reporters he would make a definitive decision six months from the election .
Kayhan , a newspaper aligned with Khamenei , predicted that Iran 's powerful Guardian Council would block Mashaei 's candidacy if he decides to run .
The Guardian Council vets all candidates before any elections in Iran .
Mashaei , who is launching a newspaper next month , is also believed to have tried to secure the release of three Americans detained in Iran , a move that resulted in the release of one of the prisoners , Sarah Shourd .
Her friends , Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal , remain in Tehran after their release was believed to have been blocked by hardliners ."
2011-04-27,""" This year will be a difficult year .
Fasten your seatbelt and put on your iron - clad boots .
Soon commotions will be heard . ""
According to the Tehran - based Javan Online – a publication close to the Revolutionary Guards – this statement was made by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's senior adviser and confidant , Esfandiyar Rahim Meshai , days before the forced resignation of Iran 's intelligence minister , Heydar Moslehi , on 17 April .
Moslehi resigned after a major dispute with Meshai and Ahmadinejad over who should head the intelligence ministry 's bureau of planning and budget .
Until now , there is nothing extraordinary about this story , because when it comes to firing ministers , no president can beat Ahmadinejad 's record in post - revolution Iran .
Ministers have been fired before , such as former intelligence minister Gholamhossein Mohseni - Ejei .
Others , such as the former foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , were not only fired but humiliated by being dismissed while visiting a foreign country .
In fact , Mottaki heard the news of his dismissal from his Senegalese hosts who were informed before he was .
When it comes to saying "" You 're fired "" , Ahmadinejad would make Donald Trump and Alan Sugar , the hosts of The Apprentice , look like novices .
But what sets the dismissal of the current intelligence minister apart is the reaction of Iran 's most powerful man , Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei .
Much to the shock and surprise of many Iran observers , and quite possibly the president himself , after staying quiet for seven years and not mentioning a word about Ahmadinejad 's dismissals in public , Khamenei has suddenly and publicly put his foot down , like never before .
He did this not only by reinstating Moslehi to his job but by coming out and chastising Ahmadinejad 's decision because he felt "" expediency is being ignored "" .
Even more surprisingly , Khamenei also stated that : "" I wo n't allow , as long as I 'm alive , an iota of deviation of this massive movement of the nation . ""
But why now ?
Where has Khamenei been all these years ?
What is so special about Moslehi that has brought him to utter such a strong condemnation ?
How come he did n't say anything when Ali Larijani was forced to resign in November 2007 ?
Larijani is infinitely closer to Khamenei than Moslehi . ""
Loose lips sink ships "" was the famous British slogan during the second world war .
UK citizens were told to be careful about what they said , because the enemy might be listening .
Ayatollah Khamenei has the same concern .
He did not reinstate Moslehi only because he was becoming concerned about his and Ahmadinejad 's growing power – which , as far as some people in Iran 's leadership are concerned , is getting out of hand .
What seems to have concerned Iran 's leader is the manipulation of intelligence material by Meshai and Ahmadinejad and his rivals for their own political benefit .
Although this has probably happened before , Khamenei seems to have realised that it is going too far .
And he has a point .
There is much political scoring going on in Iran with the use of what different sides claim to be intelligence - related material .
One recent example is when a text message was sent to thousands of recipients from the treasury .
According to the government , this happened because the system was hacked .
However , according to the Persian - language Rooz online publication , which is based in Belgium , the text message stated that Meshai had installed listening devices in the office of the supreme leader .
It also had stated that Meshai had travelled to Dubai the previous month as part of a trade delegation , where he met US officials .
These are serious allegations .
It is not only those who are against Ahmadinejad and Meshai who have used such methods in their favour .
Ahmadinejad has done the same .
During the 2009 presidential debates with Mir Hossein Mousavi , live on air , and in front of millions of Iranians , he threatened to show evidence against him .
These were believed to be photos taken secretly of Mousavi 's wife without her hijab .
This infuriated Mousavi .
In fact it is believed to be one of the reasons why he has dug in his heels against Ahmadinejad ever since .
By reinstating Moslehi , the Iranian supreme leader has now declared that the ministry of intelligence is out of bounds , both for the president and those who oppose him .
This sounds logical , especially because Ahmadinejad is such a controversial figure and has many enemies inside the regime .
Ahmadinejad has taken the reprimand very badly .
On Wednesday he cancelled a trip to the city of Qom .
He also refused to attend a government meeting where the newly reinstated Moslehi was present .
In my opinion , for the first time since becoming president , the prospect of Ahmadinejad 's resignation must be considered .
Although at this point it 's a small possibility , nevertheless it is one that never existed until now , and can not be ignored .
The reason is related to Ahmadinejad 's own personality .
He is not good at taking "" no "" for an answer .
He is now sulking , and according to reports has set three conditions for his return : the removal of Moslehi , the removal of Saeed Jalili as Iran 's chief nuclear negotiator and the reinstatement of Meshai as Ahmadinejad 's first deputy .
The Iranian president has sulked before .
But this time it is very serious .
If he does n't get his way he will either be left with no option but to resign , or to continue with the knowledge that this affair will have put an end to Meshai 's chances of running for president .
And without Meshai , once Ahmadinejad leaves office , if he lasts that long , it will be the end of his political career .
Ahmadinejad will only have himself to blame because of his constant attacks , which have made him many enemies .
Loose lips sink ships , in more ways than one ."
2011-04-27,"A rift is emerging between Iran 's president and its supreme leader , prompting several members of the parliament to call for the impeachment of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who has not been seen in public for days .
Ahmadinejad has refused to appear at the presidential palace since Friday in what is being seen as a reaction to Ayatollah Khamenei 's reinstating of a minister he initially "" asked to resign "" .
Under pressure from Ahmadinejad the intelligence minister , Heydar Moslehi , a close ally of the supreme leader , stepped down on 17 April but was reinstated when Khamenei asked him in a letter to stay .
The president has not publicly shown his support for that decision and on Wednesday he refused for the second time to chair a cabinet meeting in which Moslehi was present .
Ahmadinejad also reportedly cancelled an official visit to the holy city of Qom prompting reactions among conservatives that "" the president was sulking "" .
Under Iran 's constitution , the president is in charge of appointing cabinet ministers who will hold the ministerial office after the approval of the parliament but an unwritten law requires all officials to abide by the supreme leader .
Iran 's opposition has speculated that Khamenei is worried about the increasing power of Ahmadinejad and especially his chief - of - staff Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei .
Khamenei is believed to be particularly concerned about two key positions in the cabinet , the ministry of foreign affairs and the intelligence ministry , where he traditionally has influence .
Ahmadinejad 's administration is also accused of losing billions of dollars of Iran 's oil revenues in recent years .
Last December , Ahmadinejad sacked Manouchehr Mottaki without consulting Khamenei while the former foreign minister was in middle of an official visit to Africa .
Mottaki was replaced by Ali Akbar Salehi , the former head of the country 's atomic energy agency .
After the dismissal of Mottaki , Ahmadinejad 's assertion of control over Iran 's foreign policy became clear .
By attempting to dismiss Moslehi , some analysts believe that Ahmadinejad is entering a new phase of extending his control over key positions in the run - up to the March 2012 parliamentary election .
Ahmadinejad enjoyed the full support of the supreme leader when Khamenei backed him in the disputed presidential elections in 2009 .
Independent commentators believe that Khamenei has realised "" his mistake "" by supporting a president who is seeking to surpass him .
Since the first signs of split emerged , several members of the Iranian parliament have called on Ahmadinejad to publicly support Khamenei 's decision over Moslehi , a request he has so far declined .
Some prominent figures in the powerful revolutionary guards have also asked the president to comply with the supreme leader .
On Tuesday , Parliament News , a website run by Iranian MPs reported that "" the plan to impeach Ahmadinejad has begun "" in the parliament , with 12 MPs asking for him to be summoned before them .
Conservatives believe that the increasing tension between Ahmadinejad and Khamenei stems from the growing influence of Mashaei , who is being groomed by Ahmadinejad as his possible successor .
Mashaei , whose daughter married Ahmadinejad 's son , has become the most controversial figure in Iran , provoking harsh criticism from conservatives by favouring a greater cultural openness and opposing greater clerical involvement in the regime .
Mashaei , who champions a nationalist narrative of Iran 's history , was himself forced to step down as Iran 's first vice - president in July 2009 when Khamenei intervened in an unprecedented move and said in a letter that "" the regime 's expediency "" required Mashaei to go .
Ahmadinejad , to the surprise of many , then appointed Mashaei as his chief - of - staff instead .
Khamenei has tried to play down his confrontation with Ahmadinejad in recent days .
In an official visit to the southern province of Fars last Saturday , he praised the achievements made by Ahmadinejad 's government and told the crowd he only intervenes in the government 's affairs when he feels that "" the expediency is ignored "" .
He added : "" I wo n't allow as long as I 'm alive , an iota of deviation of this massive movement of the nation . """
2011-05-06,"An unprecedented power struggle at the heart of the Iranian regime has intensified after it emerged that the supreme leader , Ali Khamenei , had given an ultimatum to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to accept his intervention in a cabinet appointment or resign .
A member of the Iranian parliament , Morteza Agha - Tehrani – who is described as "" Ahmadinejad 's moral adviser "" – told a gathering of his supporters on Friday that a meeting between Ahmadinejad and Khamenei had recently taken place , in which the president was given a deadline to resign or to accept the decision of the ayatollah .
The extraordinary confrontation came to light after Ahmadinejad declined to officially support Khamenei 's reinstatement of a minister whom the president had initially asked to resign .
The rift between the two men grew when the president staged an 11-day walkout in an apparent protest at Khamenei 's decision .
In the first cabinet meeting since ending his protest , the intelligence minister at the centre of the row , Heydar Moslehi , was absent and in the second one on Wednesday , he was reportedly asked by Ahmadinejad to leave .
In a video released on Iranian websites , Agha - Tehrani quotes Ahmadinejad as saying : "" [ Khamenei ] gave me a deadline to make up my mind .
I would either accept [ the reinstatement ] or resign . ""
Although Khamenei is not constitutionally allowed to intervene in cabinet appointments , an unwritten law requires all officials to always abide by the supreme leader without showing any opposition .
Clerics close to Khamenei have launched a campaign to highlight his role in Iranian politics , saying that to disobey him is equal to apostasy , as he is "" God 's representative on earth "" .
Meanwhile , the president was reportedly absent from religious ceremonies this week at Khamenei 's house , where he was publicly criticised by close allies of the ayatollah .
Iranian officials are traditionally required to participate in such ceremonies in order to cover up any political rift that might compromise Khamenei 's power .
Iran 's semi - official Mehr news agency reported on Thursday that several members of parliament had revived a bid to summon Ahmadinejad for questioning over "" the recent events "" .
It said 90 MPs had signed the petition , up from only 12 last week .
Under Iranian law , at least 85 more signatures are required for a possible impeachment of the president .
Supporters of Khamenei say that Ahmadinejad is surrounded by "" deviants "" in his inner circle , including his controversial chief of staff , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , who wants to undermine the involvement of clerics in Iran 's politics .
Mashaei and his allies have recently been accused of using supernatural powers and invoking djinns ( spirits ) in pursuing the government 's policies .
On Thursday , the commander of the powerful revolutionary guards , Mohammad Ali Jafari , was quoted by the semi - official Fars news agency as saying : "" People [ close to Khamenei ] are not relying on djinns , fairies and demons ... and they will not stand any deviation [ of the government in this regime ] .
"" Iran 's elite revolutionary guards , who played an important role in securing Ahmadinejad a second term in Iran 's 2009 "" rigged "" elections , have distanced themselves from Ahmadinejad in recent months as Mashaei 's "" secular "" views have become more pronounced .
In the face of these recent confrontation with Khamenei , Ahmadinejad has been left isolated , with only a handful of serious supporters .
Iran 's opposition , exhausted by the brutal crackdown of the green movement and the placing of its leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi under house arrest in the past 80 days , has found itself watching these recent developments and wondering what will happen next ."
2011-05-09,"No Iranian president has ever dared to challenge the supremacy of Ali Khamenei 's two - decade - long leadership as publicly as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad did recently in an extraordinary power struggle between him and the ayatollah .
The unprecedented confrontation at the top of the Iranian regime began only a month ago when Khamenei , the supreme leader , intervened in a cabinet appointment by reinstating a minister who had initially resigned "" under pressure from Ahmadinejad "" .
In reaction to the reinstatement of Heydar Moslehi , the intelligence minister at the centre of the row , Ahmadinejad apparently staged an 11-day walkout from the presidential palace and refused to chair cabinet meetings .
At first glance , Ahmadinejad 's feud with the ayatollah seemed like a conventional disagreement between two leaders of one country but in Iran , where Khamenei is described as "" God 's representative on Earth "" , Ahmadinejad 's opposition was extremely serious .
In fact , Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi , a prominent cleric close to Khamenei and a supporter of Ahmadinejad in the past , said that disobeying Khamenei is equal to "" apostasy from God "" .
His remarks were echoed by several other political figures including senior officials in the powerful revolutionary guards who urged Ahmadinejad to accept Khamenei 's ruling over Moslehi .
Under the Iranian constitution , the president is in charge of appointing cabinet ministers who take up ministerial duties after approval from parliament .
But an unwritten law puts Khamenei above the constitution and requires all officials to comply with the supreme leader at all times without showing any opposition .
To bestow legitimacy on his unconstitutional intervention in the cabinet appointment , Khamenei 's decision was supported by an overwhelming majority of Iranian MPs who signed a petition and asked Ahmadinejad to abide by the supreme leader .
This was not a particularly surprising move , since Iranian MPs are all filtered by the Guardian Council which vets all candidates before any election and is under direct control of the supreme leader .
Ahmadinejad 's disobedience , on the other hand , was a surprise for many who saw the president as Khamenei 's stooge whose own success in Iran 's 2009 "" stolen "" election was secured with help from the ayatollah and his military elite , the revolutionary guards .
Mutual support between Ahmadinejad and Khamenei served a purpose for both of them in the past , and mutual enmity is serving a purpose now .
Each is trying to gain some popularity with the people by distancing himself from the other .
Ahmadinejad is portraying Khamenei as an obstacle to the success of his policies and Khamenei is perhaps using him as a scapegoat should the "" Arab spring "" start to affect Iran .
Possibly Ahmadinejad has his eyes set on a third presidential term .
As the constitution stands , he is limited to two terms – which means he must step down ( probably into obscurity ) in 2013 .
However , he may be hoping to change the rules before then , especially if his supporters do well in the 2012 parliamentary elections .
The other possibility – which may be more likely – is that he has been grooming his chief of staff , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , to succeed him in the presidency .
Mashaei 's daughter , incidentally , is married to Ahmadinejad 's son .
Mashaei 's "" liberal "" views and his opposition to the greater involvement of clerics in politics have worried Khamenei and his camp who believe Mashaei and his team – often described as a "" deviant current "" within Ahmadinejad 's inner circle – are seeking to compromise the supreme leader 's power .
On Sunday , Ahmadinejad , under pressure from Khamenei 's camp to accept the reinstatement of Moslehi , finally appeared in a cabinet meeting with the presence of the intelligence minister .
However , this does not seem like an end to a dispute which has only begun .
Khamenei 's trust for Ahmadinejad will never be the same .
Recent events in Tehran have highlighted the status of an isolated president whose power is on the wane ."
2011-05-18,"Again we saw a flood of breaking news events over the past week : the arrest of the head of the IMF Dominique Strauss - Kahn in New York , with potentially huge effects on the global response to running economic crises ; unexpected bloodshed on Israel 's borders on Nakba day ; stepped - up Nato bombing in Libya ; and , a big decision in Britain on global warming .

2011-05-19,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has suffered a series of dramatic setbacks in his power struggle with the country 's supreme leader , Ali Khamenei , after a failed attempt to challenge the clerical establishment , according to Iranian observers and diplomats .
Ahmadinejad , who drew on crucial backing from Khamenei during his disputed re - election in 2009 , has been so roundly rebuffed by his erstwhile patron that it is by no means certain he will complete his second term as president .
In recent days , Ahmadinejad and the men described as his strongest allies – his chief of staff , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , and executive deputy , Hamid Baghaei – have come under direct attack from senior figures in the powerful Revolutionary Guards and some of most important clerics in the Islamic regime .
Ahmadinejad 's many enemies across the political and religious spectrum have scented blood after the arrest of at least 25 people close to him and Mashaei .
The president 's immediate entourage has been reduced to a handful of serious people and has faced accusations of corruption , revolutionary "" deviancy "" and even espionage .
Even the president 's spiritual mentor , Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi , who strongly supported him in the 2009 presidential election , is distancing himself .
In a recent interview with an Iranian publication , Yazdi said : "" That a human being would behave in a way that angers his closest friends and allies and turns them into opponents is not logical for any politician . "" .
He told Shoma Weekly that he believed "" with more than 90 % certainty "" that Ahmadinejad had been bewitched "" .
"" We saw that this questionable person [ Mashaei ] has conquered this gentleman [ Ahmadinejad ] and is in his fist , "" he said .
Ayatollah Ahmad Janati , a close ally of Khamenei and head of the Guardian Council , also attacked Ahmadinejad directly .
"" We did not expect this from him , "" Janati said .
In a reference to Mashaei , he said that "" some people seek to cause a deviation , and act against the country and the supreme leader "" .
Yazdi and Janati 's comments have been repeatedly echoed by senior officials in the Islamic Republic in recent days .
"" It is like wolves who have been waiting for a sign of weakness and they are now lunging in , "" said Meir Javedanfar , an Iranian - Israeli Middle East analyst and co - author of book on Ahmadinejad , The Nuclear Sphinx of Tehran .
In the latest sign of his dwindling authority , Ahmadinejad 's bid to streamline his cabinet and merge eight ministries into four was blocked by the supreme leader in a private meeting attended by the parliamentary chief , Ali Larijani .
Unable to proceed with his initial plan , Ahmadinejad fought back by dismissing three ministers and temporarily taking over the oil ministry but drew unprecedented criticism from Khamenei 's camp .
It has not helped the president that the attacks come at a time when the cash - strapped government , straining under international sanctions , has gambled on removing long - standing but costly subsidies on fuel , food and other daily essentials , triggering widespread popular resentment .
With zero growth projected this year , organised labour is beginning to flex its muscles .
Last week , some union members refused to go to work , in protest at delayed salaries and rising unemployment .
They blamed Ahmadinejad for the crisis .
Ahmadinejad emerged from relative obscurity to win the presidency in 2005 , not least because the supreme leader adopted him as his protege .
In recent months , he has sought to assert the presidential prerogative in hiring and firing ministers .
He got his way in December , sacking the foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , a Khamenei favourite , without warning .
When he tried to do the same thing in April to the intelligence minister , Heydar Moslehi , Khamenei struck back and ordered Moslehi 's reinstatement .
In response , Ahmadinejad took the quixotic decision of boycotting his own job and disappeared from office for 11 days .
Ultimately , however , he had little choice but to return and grudgingly put up with Moslehi . ""
Ahmadinejad must know he was always pushing his luck .
He has always been a risk - taker , and he always knew that sooner or later he would hit something hard , "" a western diplomat said .
"" Whether this is terminal for him , it 's a bit early to say , but the defence of the supreme leader and the attack on Ahmadinejad has had the look of a whole government acting in concert .
People were sent out to the regions , including the IRGC [ the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ] , to send the message that the supreme leader is in control . ""
Ahmadinejad , whose presidency is limited to two terms under Iranian law , must step down in 2013 .
The depth of rift with the supreme leader has raised speculation he might leave early , triggering a crisis .
Some are comparing him to Abdulhassan Banisadr , Iran 's first post - revolutionary president , who was impeached in 1981 after clashing with Ayatollah Khomeini and forced to flee the country .
Speaking from Paris , Banisadr said : "" Khamenei is so fed up with Ahmadinejad that [ the president ] might not even survive before his term finishes . ""
Conversely , Ahmadinejad could resign .
But to do so before securing the position of a chosen successor would leave him little protection once out of office .
For Khamenei , the worry is whether the Islamic republic can survive him in its present form ; Khamenei turns 72 in July .
"" There 's always the issue of Khamenei 's death and what happens then , "" said Hamid Dabashi , a professor of Iranian studies at Columbia University .
"" Ahmadinejad and his people have an eye on the days after Khamenei 's death from now and are seeking to make the position of the next supreme leader as rather symbolic . """
2011-05-20,"A top aide in the office of the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has been arrested , adding to tension at the heart of the regime .
Iran 's semi - official Fars news agency reported the arrest of a man identified only as "" one of the top officials in the presidential office "" .
Conservative websites later named him as Kazem Kiapasha and described him as a close ally of Ahmadinejad 's chief of staff , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei .
The move comes after the arrest of at least 25 other people close to the president and Mashaei .
They have been detained as part of an extraordinary power struggle between Ahmadinejad and the supreme leader , Ayatollah Khamenei .
Abbas Amirifar , head of the government 's cultural committee , was among those previously arrested .
Alef , a conservative website run by a member of the Iranian parliament , Ahmad Tavakoli , said that Kiapasha had been appointed by Mashaei to take over a key position in the presidential office .
The position enabled him to vet all presidential aides before being hired , according to Alef .
The attack on Ahmadinejad 's narrowing circle has intensified after senior figures in the powerful Revolutionary Guards and the regime 's influential clerics began verbal assaults targeting the president and his allies .
Mashaei , who has been touted as Ahmadinejad 's chosen successor , is caught at the centre of the row .
On Wednesday , a weekly run by radical supporters of Khamenei carried a headline that read "" Arrest Mashaei "" .
The hardline publication , Ya Lesara , accused Mashaei of being the head of a "" deviant current "" in Ahmadinejad 's inner circle and of attempting to undermine the supreme leader 's authority .
Ghassem Fadayi , a cleric close to Khamenei , said that Ahmadinejad is becoming "" humanist "" , a characteristic deplored by Muslim scholars .
An opposition website on Thursday claimed that Mashaei and Ahmadinejad 's executive deputy , Hamid Baghaei , had been interrogated by Khamenei 's intelligence officers twice in the past few days .
Supporters of Khamenei have also accused Mashaei of spying on behalf of foreign governments .
Hossein Fadayi , a conservative MP , said Mashaei was in contact with "" foreign secret services "" .
Espionage is punishable by death under Iranian law .
Mashaei 's sympathisers say that conservatives are preparing grounds for his arrest .
In a separate incident in Tehran , the government 's news agency , Irna , which is run by Ahmadinejad 's media adviser , sued Keyhan , a daily under the direct control of the supreme leader ."
2011-05-21,"This week the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took his challenge against the supreme leader , Ali Khamenei , to a new high by warning that Khamenei would be powerless without public support . ""
The leader 's hands are tied without public support , "" Ahmadinejad told the state TV 's channel 2 .
Questioning the sanctity of the supreme leader in this direct fashion goes against the grain of the Islamic republic , especially when uttered by the president and when it follows another episode of power struggle .
Ahmadinejad also confronted the conservative majority in parliament by rejecting its demand for a new committee to oversee the parliamentary elections due this winter .
He insisted that no one other than the ministry of interior has the right to interfere in the elections .
In one week he reduced eight ministries to four , sacked four ministers , appointed a new deputy and named himself as caretaker oil minister without the due parliamentary procedures or consultation with the leader .
This escalating confrontation between the president and the leader on the one hand , and the president and the parliament on the other is causing new cracks at the leadership level , effectively creating a three - tier system .
It is also causing further friction in conservative ranks , creating three major camps and several splinter groups .
The controversial Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , who is Ahmadinejad 's chief of staff , his main adviser and confidant , leads the president 's team .
They are the most rightwing conservatives ; yet , because they are nonclerical and younger looking
they seem bold in challenging the clergy .
Mashaei is demanding an "" Iranian republic "" rather than an "" Islamic Republic "" – apparently in an effort to attract the young who protested after the presidential elections of 2009 .
He presents himself as the theorist of a new school of thought praising the glories of Iran , and humanity , putting these above Islam .
On Wednesday he received authorisation to open a private university called the International Comprehensive University for Iranians – whatever that means .
He is also said to be funding several new newspapers including the popular Haft e Sobh ( "" Seven in the Morning "" ) .
Designed to be modern and fashionable to appeal to the young , it covers gossip , music , film , cooking and sport .
Yekshanbe Weekly and Tamasha daily are other papers launched allegedly by Mashaei who is keen on winning the youth vote in the presidential elections of 2013 .
The conservatives are hitting back .
They call Mashaei and his supporters the "" misguided gang "" .
Some like Faashnews ( "" Revealing News "" ) close to Mohammad Hossein Safar - Harandy , a staunch supporter of the supreme leader , call Ahmadinejad and Mashaei "" coup plotters "" .
There are numerous articles in conservative papers accusing the group of being the new threat to the Islamic Republic .
Even Ahmadinejad 's guru , Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi , criticised him on Thursday for undermining the leader for the sake of this group , and for grooming Mashaei to be the next president .
Oblivious to the conservative backlash , the president strengthened his team on Thursday by appointing another controversial deputy , Ruhollah Ahmadzadeh - Kermani , a close associated of Mashaei .
The more serious confrontation is taking place in parliament where majority conservative MPs are calling on Ahmadinejad to justify what they term as his "" illegal "" decisions .
The parliament speaker , Ali Larijani , has demanded that recent changes to the ministries must first be approved by the parliament .
The president is also being ridiculed for appointing himself as caretaker oil minister in order to chair the 159th Opec meeting due on 8 June in Vienna .
Some 12 MPs listing 50 cases of president 's disregard for the constitution are threatening impeachment and the powerful Guardian Council has branded his oil ministry move as "" illegal "" .
What would tilt the balance is the support of the powerful Revolutionary Guards .
The chief commander of Revolutionary Guards has refrained from taking sides .
He has , however , expressed his dislike of the "" misguided gang "" .
"" There are many insiders concealing their opposition to the leader , "" General Mohammad Ali Jafari told Fardanews .
"" If they dare reveal their views they will be defeated "" .
In what appears like a friendly warning to Ahmadinejad , he said it was not clear why "" a popular politician "" should continue to provide cover for this divergent group .
Ahmadinejad has proved to be obstinate both at home and in international affairs .
Yet , it is hard to see how he can muster the required political strength to fight both the supreme leader and the parliament , especially when the conservative majority and the almost all clergy are against him , and the Revolutionary Guards are sounding disapproval .
As for the public support he is so keen on , it is also hard to see the public going behind him in opposition to the leader .
It is even less likely that the progressive young will be swayed by Mashaei 's flirtations .
They are highly sceptical of anyone connected to Ahmadinejad .
Instead they are watching and waiting for the conservatives to fight their way out .
They know that casting the new Iranian political mould will not be done by anyone inside the Islamist regime ."
2011-06-01,"Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is locked in confrontation with MPs after being warned he acted illegally by declaring himself caretaker oil minister in what his critics called an unconstitutional power grab .
Iranian media reported that the majlis ( parliament ) , which has repeatedly clashed with the president over key policy issues in recent weeks , voted 165 - 1 to approve a report by its energy committee , which declared Ahmadinejad 's move an "" obvious violation of law "" .
The vote was triggered by the president 's sacking of the oil minister , Massoud Mirkazemi , which was part of a plan to merge eight ministries into four to cut their overall number to 17 .
Observers said it was unclear whether there was now a real threat that Ahmadinejad could be impeached .
But it was the latest spat in an increasingly ugly struggle between the president and his onetime mentor , the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Aides to Khamenei have castigated Ahmadinejad 's controversial chief - of - staff Esfandiar Rahim - Mashaie as representing a "" deviant current "" moving Iran away from Islamic principles .
Accusations of "" perversion "" , witchcraft and exorcism have been bandied around – as well as more conventional complaints of corruption .
The majlis vote was spearheaded by the speaker , Ali Larijani , who was sacked by Ahmadinejad as Iran 's national security chief in 2007 but is seen as a prospective candidate for the presidency in 2013 .
Ahmadinejad 's original bid to streamline his cabinet was blocked by Khamenei .
Ahmadinejad fought back by dismissing three ministers and temporarily taking over the oil ministry , but drew furious criticism from Khamenei 's camp .
The move by MPs reflects mounting alarm by Ahmadinejad 's rivals in the country 's conservative ruling elite , including hardline clerics and the elite Revolutionary Guards , especially since it involves the hugely important energy sector – the source of 80 % of Iranian state revenue – and because Ahmadinejad is famous for his populist economic policies .
Late last month parliament voted to investigate allegations that the president had misused state funds as effective bribes by giving $ 80 ( £ 48.80 ) each to 9 million voters before the 2009 presidential election .
To complicate matters further , Iran is also the current chairman of Opec , although Ahmadinejad has said he will not attend its summit in Vienna next week . ""
This illegal and hasty action will undermine the Islamic Republic of Iran 's interests on the international level , "" the conservative - dominated parliament said in its report . ""
Mr Ahmadinejad as oil minister has issued some orders and will continue to issue orders which are obvious examples of illegal interference with governmental financial resources . ""
Ahmadinejad has the power to remove ministers and put caretakers in place for up to three months before having to consult parliament and insists that no - one should have been surprised by the reshuffle .
Iran 's constitutional watchdog , the guardian council , has already called his takeover of the oil ministry illegal .
The final say on the ministry lies with Khamenei – whose wholehearted backing for Ahmadinejad since his disputed re - election two years ago can clearly no longer be taken for granted .
In recent months , Ahmadinejad has sought to assert the presidential prerogative in hiring and firing ministers .
He got his way in December , sacking the foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , a Khamenei favourite , without warning .
But tensions exploded in April when Khamenei stopped Ahmadinejad from dismissing the intelligence minister , Heydar Moslehi , in a public intervention to limit the president 's power .
That provoked Ahmadinejad into a bizarre 11-day refusal to appear in public or carry out any duties .
The escalating power struggle in Tehran comes less than a year before parliamentary elections – due in March 2012 – in which prominent opposition figures are unlikely to be allowed to run , and rival conservative factions will battle for control of the legislature .
Presidential elections are due in 2013 ."
2011-06-03,"With soaring fuel costs , chronic traffic jams and the devil - may - care recklessness of fellow drivers , Iranian motorists probably thought they already had enough to contend with .
Now a new hazard has appeared to further complicate matters : rising camel prices .
Insurers , motorists and even President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad have got the hump over a decision to link compensation payments for accidents on the country 's notoriously high - speed roads to the market price of the slow - moving beasts more commonly associated with desert travel .
Iran 's judiciary – which is independent of Ahmadinejad 's government – has decreed that from next week compensation or "" blood money "" for relatives of fatal road accident victims should equal the price of 100 camels .
That will have the effect of doubling compensation payouts from 450 m to 900 m rials ( £ 52,000 ) .
The judiciary spokesman , Gholam - Hossein Mohseni - Ejei , said the steep rise was due to a failure to link annual compensation rates to the price of camels in recent years , meaning awards had been artificially low . ""
Unfortunately , during the last few years , the price of camels has been calculated only once , "" he told Iranian journalists . ""
Every year , compensation money has increased according to the inflation rate and this calculation has been wrong . ""
He said Iran 's interpretation of Islamic law allowed blood money to be based on the price of 100 camels , 1,000 sheep , 200 cows , quantities of gold or silver , or 200 items of Yemeni clothing .
Officials decided the price a camel currently fetches in three remote Iranian provinces , around 9 m rials ( £ 520 ) , was the fairest measure .
Insurance companies have reacted furiously , saying they could be bankrupted by demands for increased payouts in a country that already has one of the world 's highest fatal road accident rates , with an estimated 23,000 people killed each year .
Critics also fear many drivers will stop paying insurance altogether to evade higher premiums – causing a jump in the number of motorists being jailed for failing to meet compensation payments .
Ahmadinejad , angered by suggestions that his government should subsidise insurance firms to help them cope , has pledged to raise the matter with the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Traffic police and the state - run compensation board say the increase will encourage safer driving .
Justifying the move , Assadollah Joolaei , head of the compensation board , equated safe driving with stopping smoking . ""
If that smoking driver saves his cigarette money , he can reduce his insurance fee , "" he said .

2011-06-07,"Iran 's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has admitted for the first time that a rift has developed between him and some of the most senior figures of the Islamic regime .
In a press conference in Tehran on Tuesday , the first since news emerged of his power struggle with the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the president said : "" It is very clear now that we are 180 degrees away from them – we are actually on opposite sides . ""
He pointed the finger at ruling conservatives , who have accused the government of "" revolutionary deviancy "" , while playing down suggestions that he has been at odds with Ali Khamenei .
In recent months , conservatives close to the supreme leader have launched an extensive campaign against the president and his allies , who they believe are undermining the supremacy of the leader .
Senior figures in the powerful revolutionary guards and some of the most prominent clerics in the country who have supported Ahmadinejad in the past are now distancing themselves from him .
Those who remain in his camp have faced accusations of "" sorcery "" , "" deviancy "" and even espionage , and some presidential aides have been arrested . ""
They arrested those people .
Good for them , "" Ahmadinejad said .
"" Now they should let us continue our job .
The government is seeking for nothing rather than serving the people and fulfilling the revolutionary aims . ""
He refused to answer further questions about the power struggle and said : "" Our position at the moment is to stay silent .
An inspiring unity silence . ""
Ali Khamenei 's supporters believe Ahmadinejad has not publicly given his full backing to the supreme leader after they clashed over cabinet appointments in April .
Asked about Iran 's nuclear programme , the president denied recent allegations made by the chief executive of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , Yukiya Amano , that the country may be working on developing nuclear weapons . ""
With America 's orders , the IAEA has written some things in a report that are against the law and against the agency 's regulations .
These have no legal value and aside from harming the agency 's reputation it will have no other effect , "" Ahmadinejad told reporters .
He also said no offer from world leaders could stop Iran enriching uranium and accused the US and its allies of meddling in Syria and Bahrain ."
2011-06-12,"A leading Iranian journalist and opposition figure has died of a heart attack after spending 10 days on hunger strike in Tehran 's notorious Evin prison .
Hoda Saber , a 52-year - old political activist from the opposition Nationalist - Religious movement , was taken to the Modarres hospital in the city after a cardiac complication , which his wife claims was brought on by his hunger strike .
The news of his death coincides with the second anniversary of Iran 's disputed presidential election , which gave Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a second term .
Speaking from Tehran , Saber 's wife , Farideh Jamshidi , told the Guardian : "" My husband died two days ago , but we were unaware of his death until today when someone in the hospital informed one of our friends . ""
She said Saber stopped eating food and later stopped drinking water in protest at the death of his fellow dissident Haleh Sahabi , She died of a heart attack during scuffles with security forces at the funeral of her father , Ezatollah Sahabi , the leader of the Nationalist - Religious alliance of politicians , on 1 June .
Jamshidi accused prison officials of negligence toward her husband , saying she received reports that they delayed transferring him to hospital for six hours . ""
Doctors told us later that they could have saved his life by taking him to the hospital earlier .
We were supposed to visit him in the prison tomorrow and now we have to visit his dead body in the cemetery .
"" Iran 's semi - official Fars news agency denied the allegations and said Saber had received medical care before his death .
It accused the opposition of politicising his death .
After disappearing for two weeks in July 2010 , Saber 's family were informed that he had been picked up by security officials and taken to Evin .
When Haleh Sahabi died at her father 's funeral , Saber – who had served several jail terms in the past – and his fellow inmate Amir Khosro Dalirsani said in a joint statement that they would go on hunger strike in protest over her death and over the brutal crackdown against protesters by the regime .
Several human rights organisations have issued statements coinciding with the anniversary of the election and many have expressed concerns for those political prisoners arrested since 2009 .
The foreign secretary , William Hague , also issued a statement , saying : "" Two years after people took to the streets to demand reform , I want it to be known that our attention has not been diverted and we will continue to call on Iran to implement its international human rights obligations . """
2011-06-17,"Economists have reacted with scepticism to an IMF statement that praises the economic policies of Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , in the face of drastic punitive measures against the country .
The IMF said it has revised its previous figures on Iran 's economy after a brief visit to the country , expressing admiration for some of the controversial plans introduced by the hardline president .
A mission led by Dominique Guillaume , a deputy division chief at the IMF , which travelled to Iran for two weeks in May and June this year , concluded that the government had been successful "" in reducing inequalities , improving living standards and supporting domestic demand "" .
The IMF previously predicted that Iran 's economy would suffer zero growth in 2011 , but now says real GDP growth recovered to an estimated 3.5 % last year and forecast "" positive growth momentum continued in 2010/11 "" .
It also said inflation had been brought down from 25.4 % to 12.4 % .
The statement attracted extensive coverage in Iran 's state - run media , which said the IMF had "" corrected "" itself .
Independent experts , however , raised doubts over the IMF 's latest conclusions and questioned its support for Ahmadinejad 's policy of removing long - standing but costly subsidies on fuel , food and other daily essentials , implemented last December .
The IMF statement said : "" The mission commended the authorities for the early success in the implementation of their ambitious subsidy reform programme . ""
Hassan Hakimian , an economic expert and director of the London Middle East Institute at SOAS , said : "" The IMF has long advocated the abolition of food and energy subsidies in Iran .
Yet , what is hard to digest is the basis for its suggestions about improvements in living standards and greater equality due to this programme in such a short span of time .
"" I believe the IMF is on the optimistic side and comes across as rather rash in its judgment .
Most independent observers believe that it 's too soon to draw such conclusions … and it has not yet produced the required evidence to substantiate the claims made . ""
According to Hakimian , official data about Iran 's economy such as inflation and unemployment rates are often disputed both internally and externally .
Borghan Nezami Narajabad , assistant professor of economics at Rice University in Texas , criticised the IMF 's "" backward looking "" and "" premature conclusions "" and said the split between Iran 's parliament and the government over the plan showed it had not worked successfully . ""
The subsidy plan has actually increased the government 's fiscal burden .
The IMF has completely contradicted its own previous views … and has ignored views such as those expressed by the World Economic Outlook of the IMF . ""
Since Ahmadinejad took the office in 2005 , independent economists have been silenced and some , such as Saeed Laylaz and Fariborz Raeis - Dana , have been detained .

This article was amended on 18 and 20 June to correct the name World Energy Outlook to World Economic Outlook of the IMF , and to delete the word "" independent "" in this sentence ( as the WEO is tied to the IMF ) :

2011-06-21,"Ministers in Iran moved a step closer towards impeaching the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , after a series of clashes with supporters of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Impeachment proceedings were launched against foreign minister Ali Akbar Salehi for appointing a man close to Ahmadinejad 's chief - of - staff , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , as his deputy .
Supporters of Khamenei , including the overwhelming majority of parliament , say Ahmadinejad is under the spell of Mashaei , who is accused of attempting to undermine clerical power and increase his own political influence .
A power struggle between Ahmadinejad and the establishment , especially the clerics , has come to light after the controversies surrounding Mashaei became public .
Muhammad Sharif Malekzadeh , the deputy foreign minister in the middle of the row , was appointed last week but has already resigned .
Despite that , Iranian MPs went ahead with their motion to impeach Salehi , signed by 33 deputies , which was officially read out in the parliament . ""
The motion to impeach [ Salehi ] has not been halted ...
It is up to the members of the parliament to withdraw their impeachment request , "" the parliamentary speaker , Ali Larijani , was quoted as saying by Iranian news agencies .
In a further setback for the president , who had gone to the parliament for the first time after weeks of exchanging verbal attacks with various lawmakers , especially Larijani , Ahmadinejad 's nominee for the new post of minister of sport and youth was rejected .
Meanwhile , several MPs warned Ahmadinejad of his own possible impeachment if he insisted on supporting Mashaei and his allies , who are described as a "" deviant current "" within the inner circle of the president , and are accused of everything from corruption to sorcery .
Speaking to the Khabaronline conservative news website , Ali Motahari , an influential MP , said the motion to impeach Ahmadinejad would be delivered within 10 days . ""
In a meeting with the parliamentary clerics , we decided to launch the motion [ to impeach the president ] in less than 10 days and avoid any delays , "" Motahari was quoted as saying .
Another lawmaker , Fazel Mousavi , said last week that Ahmadinejad "" is only one yellow card away from impeachment "" after the president reshuffled his cabinet and took over the oil ministry temporarily .
At the same time , Mojtaba Zolnour , the supreme leader 's deputy representative in the powerful revolutionary guards said a majority of Iranian MPs would have been ready to impeach Ahmadinejad over his walkout from the presidential office earlier this year , had he not ended it voluntarily .
In April , Ahmadinejad abandoned his office for 11 days in protest at Khamenei 's intervention in a cabinet appointment .
According to Zolnour , Ahmadinejad returned to work only because he was threatened with impeachment . ""
If the motion to impeach Ahmadinejad had been begun in the parliament [ during his walkout ] , an overwhelming majority would have voted against him , "" Zolnour was quoted by Iran 's semi - official Mehr news agency as saying .
Analysts believe Khamenei is avoiding direct confrontation with Ahmadinejad by pursuing his intentions through the parliament .
Iran 's Guardian Council , a body under Khamenei 's control , vets all candidates , including all MPs , before any election ."
2011-06-23,"Iran 's former deputy foreign minister , Muhammad Sharif Malekzadeh , a close ally of the hardline president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has been arrested on charges of financial corruption .
Malekzadeh resigned from his post two days ago – only a week after he was appointed – after coming under pressure from the conservative - dominated parliament for his connections to Ahmadinejad 's controversial chief of staff and close confidant , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei .
In the face of the growing rift between Ahmadinejad and Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , allies of the president and Mashaei have come under scrutiny for allegedly attempting to undermine clerical power and compromise revolutionary values .
Supporters of Khamenei , who include a majority of the parliament , have launched a campaign against Mashaei and his team – who are described as a "" deviant current "" in the inner circle of the president .
In recent weeks , at least 25 people close to Ahmadinejad and Mashaei have been arrested , including presidential aide Kazem Kiapasha , and the head of the cultural committee , Abbas Amirifar .
Esmail Kowsari , the deputy head of the parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy , told Iran 's semi - official Mehr news agency : "" [ Malekzadeh ] was arrested this morning on financial fraud charges and because there are numerous existing cases against him .
"" Iran 's foreign minister , Ali Akbar Salehi , faced impeachment proceedings on Tuesday over the appointment of Malekzadeh , but the motion was withdrawn after Malekzadeh 's resignation .
In his resignation letter , which was addressed to Salehi , Malekzadeh wrote : "" Despite dastardly manipulations and plentiful injustices done against me , I ca n't accept that you suffer from unjust pressures because of me anymore . ""
Malekzadeh was a deputy to Mashaei when the latter headed Iran 's cultural heritage and tourism organisation .
Conservatives who say Ahmadinejad is under the spell of Mashaei are worried about the increasing influence of the chief of staff in Iran 's politics and have accused his team of anything from corruption to sorcery .
Iran 's parliament , at the same time , is believed to be only waiting for Khamenei 's green light to impeach Ahmadinejad for his support for Mashaei .
Analysts believe Khamenei would prefer the president to quietly end his term of office rather than confronting him in public .
Many believe that the only reason Mashaei himself has not yet been arrested is because Khamenei fears Ahmadinejad might resign if his right - hand man were detained .
The president 's resignation would be a blow to Khamenei , who wholeheartedly supported Ahmadinejad in the 2009 disputed presidential election , which gave him a second term in office ."
2011-06-29,"Iran 's embattled president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has warned his opponents against detaining any members of his cabinet in his first public reaction to the recent arrests of his close allies .
Speaking to reporters after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday , the president said the arrests were politically motivated , and vowed to defend his government .
Ahmadinejad 's inner circle has been reduced to a handful of people after a rift emerged between him and Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
"" I will hold myself responsible to defend the cabinet ...
the cabinet is a red line and if they want to touch the cabinet , then defending it is my duty , "" Ahmadinejad was quoted by Iran 's Irna state news agency as saying .
"" From our point of view , these moves are political and it 's clear to us that they are aimed at putting pressure on the government , "" he added .
Ahmadinejad 's remarks come a week after three of his close allies , Muhammad Sharif Malekzadeh , a former deputy foreign minister , Alireza Moghimi , a senior director and Afshin Ronaghi , a deputy minister of industries and mines , were arrested .
At least 25 other people close to Ahmadinejad and his chief of staff , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , including top presidential aides such as Kazem Kiapasha and Abbas Amirifar , were detained in recent months , after the extraordinary power struggle at the heart of Iranian regime became public .
Iranian media also reported that a group of arrested allies of the president have "" confessed "" to their crimes .
Conservatives close to Khamenei have urged Ahmadinejad to end his support for Mashaei , whom they describe as the head of a "" deviant current "" in the president 's entourage , which they claim is attempting to undermine the supremacy of Khamenei 's leadership .
Opponents of Ahmadinejad claim the president is under the spell of Mashaei , and they have accused the chief of staff 's supporters of everything from financial corruption to sorcery .
However , Ahmadinejad – whose son is married to Mashaei 's daughter – has so far shown no sign that he will shun Mashaei .
Many analysts have already predicted a lame - duck exit for Ahmadinejad , who once grabbed headlines across the world for his controversial statements at international gatherings including the UN general assembly , but some argue he might yet fight back to preserve his dwindling power in the two years before his term ends in 2013 .
Ahmadinejad and Khamenei have played down their split in public , but recent arrests and clashes between the president and the parliament , which overwhelmingly supports the supreme leader , have brought to light the extent of the rift .
In his brief meeting with reporters on Wednesday , Ahmadinejad said he would continue to stay silent against unprecedented verbal attacks on him and his narrowing circle , but he did warn that there would be a limit to his patience .
"" Our position is one of silence but in any case if they want to continue it and under different pretexts want to accuse our colleagues in the cabinet , then I have a legal , national and ethical duty to defend my colleagues , "" he said .
Iranian politicians had been pushing to impeach Ahmadinejad should he continue his support for Mashaei and bombarded him with criticism in the parliament this week .
However , Irna quoted an influential Iranian MP , Mohammad Ebrahim Nekonam , on Wednesday as saying that the motion to impeach the president had been halted .
The decision not to impeach Ahmadinejad comes after an apparent attempt by Khamanei to appeaese the president and defuse the tension between him and parliament .
Mashaei , whose name was once touted as a possible successor to Ahmadinejad , is now seen as unlikely to be allowed to nominate himself for presidential elections ."
2011-07-01,"Iran 's state television has censored a video clip that showed President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad condemning recent arrests of his close allies .
Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting ( IRIB ) , which is under the direct control of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , transmitted only an edited version of the remarks made by Ahmadinejad after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday , removing any mention of his comments over the arrests .
In reaction to the broadcaster 's move , Ahmadinejad 's official website published the full version of the video , in which the president warned opponents off his cabinet and said detaining members was "" a red line "" that should not be crossed .
In the unedited version he said : "" I will hold myself responsible to defend the cabinet … the cabinet is a red line and if they want to touch the cabinet , then defending it is my duty . ""
Ahmadinejad also said the campaign against his allies was politically motivated and aimed at putting pressure on his government .
A number of people close to Ahmadinejad and his confidant and chief of staff , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , have been arrested in recent weeks after being accused of various charges that included corruption and sorcery .
Since an extraordinary power struggle emerged between Ahmadinejad and Khamenei in April , , state media have challenged the president 's version of events several times .
State television shunned the president in April when he was blocked access to a live show in which he reportedly intended to clarify the issues surrounding his confrontation with conservatives .
The president was instead given an opportunity to speak to an interviewer on a TV programme that limited his discussions to other issues including Iran 's foreign policy .
Safir , an Iranian news website published an article about the IRIB 's broadcast of Ahmadinejad 's remarks , in which it said the release of the full version of the clip on non - official media was a message from the president that he was still capable of spreading his voice in the face of censorship . ""
The video clip of the president 's remarks was not broadcast by any of the official media ...
A president 's video has never before been broadcast in such a restricted and controlled atmosphere , "" Safir said in the article .
In the face of the confrontation , many have already called Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a lame - duck president while others believe he still has a chance to survive ."
2011-07-07,"Factional infighting , paranoia , economic ineptitude and deepening confrontation with the west have characterised Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's leadership of Iran .
But a second - term presidency launched amid bloodily suppressed protests in 2009 now appears to be assuming an even more vicious character as reports accumulate of ongoing , secret mass executions and new waves of political repression .
Hard facts are hard to come by in a country where independent reporting is all but a fond memory .
But Iranian human rights groups , international watchdogs and country experts all suggest the regime is embarked on what in effect is a judicial killing spree .
Ostensibly , it is cracking down on drug trafficking and other criminal activity .
In truth , campaigners say , Tehran is pursuing a campaign of public intimidation and covert killing to subdue political opposition and quell turbulence caused by the Arab spring revolts .
According to Amnesty International , Iran has admitted executing 190 people between January and the end of June this year ; an additional 130 reported executions have gone unacknowledged .
These figures put Iran on course for a record year for capital punishment .
In 2010 , 252 people were executed , according to official figures , with 300 more also believed to have been killed .
Iran Human Rights , an independent monitoring organisation , claims the true picture is much worse .
It says 25 people were hanged in one day – 3 July – in Ghezel Hesar prison in Karaj , west of Tehran .
The hangings , supposedly all drug - related , were not reported by official media .
The same report said another seven people were hanged the same day in Evin prison in Tehran .
It alluded to further uncorroborated mass executions in prisons in Khorasan province in 2010 .
The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran , another independent pressure group , reported last month that 26 inmates of Vakilabad prison in Mashhad were hanged on 15 June .
It quoted the Mashhad prosecutor , Mahmoud Zoghi , as admitting "" high numbers of executions "" over the past two - and - a - half years .
Zoghi said the rise was due to a high volume of drug trafficking cases . ""
The execution statistics are proportionate and foreign media unjustifiably exaggerate in this subject , "" he said .
The number of public hangings is also on the increase .
Since the start of 2011 , up to 13 men have been executed in public , eight of them since 16 April , an Amnesty report this year stated .
Iran meanwhile reportedly defied international law by executing two juveniles offenders , in Bandar Abbas on 20 April .
Overall , Iran 's execution "" average "" is running at almost two people per day in 2011 , making the regime the world 's number two executioner after China .
Public executions are typically carried out by hanging the victim from a tall industrial crane and hoisting him high into the air .
Decrying Iran 's execution "" binge "" , Mark Wallace , a former US ambassador and president of the United Against Nuclear Iran action group , said Tehran must be forced to stop . ""
The international community needs to call for an end to this kind of barbarism and highlight more broadly the deteriorating human rights situation , "" he wrote in the Los Angeles Times .
Wallace said political factors were at work .
"" It is no coincidence that Iran 's increased staging of public executions came at the same time protest movements were gaining steam through the Middle East .
What better way to keep Iranians from having ' dangerous ideas ' like those of their neighbours ?
And it should come as little surprise that Iran is now aiding other governments in the region , notably Syria , in their efforts to suppress domestic uprisings .
""
This latter claim was recently corroborated by the US treasury department .
Shirin Ebadi , the Iranian Nobel peace prizewinner , joined human rights organisations in February this year in appealing to Iran to impose a moratorium on executions – but after a brief pause following a spate of adverse international publicity , the pace of judicial killings has accelerated again .
Since then , Iran has blocked a visit by Ahmed Shaheed , a newly appointed UN Human Rights Council investigator .
Ebadi said the regime was using criminal charges , particularly drug charges , as cover for political persecution . ""
The Iranian authorities have shown that they are no longer content to repress those contesting the re - election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by arresting and convicting them – they have shown they will now resort to execution .
They are using the familiar tactic of carrying out political executions at the same time as mass executions of prisoners convicted of criminal offences .
These executions may increase if the world is silent . """
2011-07-11,"On 8 June , the head of Iran 's Atomic Energy Organisation , Fereydoun Abbasi Davani , announced plans to triple Iran 's capacity to produce 20 % enriched uranium , transferring enrichment from Natanz to the Fordo plant .
Inside Iran this announcement by a discredited regime drew little comment and was quickly overshadowed by the domestic political theatre of the latest high - profile tussles between Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
But it was an important statement because it makes even clearer the fact that Iran 's programme is not designed for purely peaceful purposes .
Iran has one civilian nuclear power station and is seeking to build more .
All of these power stations need uranium enriched to about 3.5 % for fuel .
So plans to enrich any further rightly prompt questions .
Uranium enriched to up to 20 % does have some civilian uses .
But not in the civilian nuclear power stations that Iran claims to desire .
Predominantly it is used as fuel for research reactors , producing among other things isotopes for medical use .
These are very efficient : one research reactor in Belgium is capable of producing almost all the medical isotopes needed across the whole of western Europe .
Iran has one research reactor .
The plans announced by Davani would provide more than four times its annual fuel requirements .
Yet this reactor is already capable of producing enough radioisotopes for up to 1 m medical investigations per year – already comparable to the UK and much more than Iran needs .
The plan would also require diverting at least half of Iran 's current annual output of 3.5 % enriched uranium , and so deny it to Iran 's nuclear power stations .
If Iran is serious about developing civil nuclear energy , why divert limited materials and resources away from the civil energy programme in this way , while spurning offers of technological assistance for Iran 's peaceful use of nuclear energy from the outside world , including the E3 + 3 countries of the UK , China , France , Germany , Russia and the US ?
Yet there is one clear purpose for this enriched uranium .
Enrichment from natural uranium to 20 % is the most time consuming and resource - intensive step in making the highly enriched uranium required for a nuclear weapon .
And when enough 20 % enriched uranium is accumulated at the underground facility at Qom , it would take only two or three months of additional work to convert this into weapons grade material .
There would remain technical challenges to actually producing a bomb , but Iran would be a significant step closer .
Iran 's intensified uranium enrichment is envisaged to take place at a previously covert site , buried deep beneath the mountains .
That it claims to allow International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring is not a safeguard .
Iran has a persistent record of evasion and obfuscation with the IAEA .
It has failed to provide the IAEA with access to relevant locations , equipment , persons or documents .
It has not replied to questions from the IAEA on its procurement of nuclear - related items and aspects of its work that could be useful only for developing a nuclear weapon – such as multipoint detonation for the initiation of hemispherical explosive charges or , in plain English , detonators for an atom bomb .
It has an active ballistic missile programme , including the development of missiles with a range of over a thousand kilometres , and carried out a range of missile tests in June .
A reasonable observer can not help but join the dots .
This is not an abstract issue : Iran 's nuclear programme could lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East , already the world 's most volatile region .
It would be both naive and a derogation of duty to give them – once again – the benefit of the doubt .
This is why there are already six UN security council resolutions that require Iran to suspend enrichment immediately , all ignored by Iran .
Iran has so far refused to enter into any negotiations on its nuclear programme until the E3 + 3 agrees to lift all sanctions and immediately recognise Iran 's right to enrich .
But there will remain no rationale for lifting sanctions until Iran engages in negotiations to address what are well - founded concerns about its nuclear programme .
So far , Iran has done the opposite .
This latest revelation demonstrates the urgency of increasing pressure .
The UK is prepared to take action : I have already agreed a further 100 designations to add to EU sanctions in May , and last week announced additional travel bans against known proliferators .
Iran may hope that the unprecedented changes of the Arab spring will distract the world from its nuclear programme .
We are determined that it shall not ."
2011-07-15,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's government has suffered an unprecedentedly harsh blow to its credibility during the last few weeks .
The Iranian president has witnessed the arrest of officials close to high - ranking members of his cabinet , and has engaged in an escalating war of words with senior conservatives and Iran 's judiciary .
Even high - ranking members of the Revolutionary Guards , long believed to be politically aligned with Ahmadinejad , have sparred publicly with his administration , with both sides accusing each other of illegal financial dealings .
Despite this crisis , Ahmadinejad has not only maintained his clout but has also managed to break through many of the regime 's traditional restrictions on executive power .
His political standing has been weakened but not undermined .
This has left Iranian legislators worried that Ahmadinejad can still gain long - lasting political influence through next year 's parliamentary elections .
In an effort to extend his power beyond 2013 , when his term ends , Ahmadinejad will continue to push the limits of Iran 's government structure and pick fights to place allies in influential positions , according to Hossein Askari , who holds the Iran chair at George Washington University . ""
If you are politically ambitious – and Ahmadinejad certainly is – the only way you can gain power is to cause a confrontation .
He 's not going to stop pushing , "" Askari said in an interview .
For much of his presidency , Ahmadinejad has treated the conservative - dominated parliament with contempt , boldly appointing loyalists in vital state organisations with the tacit approval of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
During the past six years , he has appointed and replaced political allies in key institutions , such as the ministries of oil , foreign affairs and economy , as well as the central bank .
At the same time , he has either weakened or removed structural bodies , such as the Management and Planning Organisation , which were responsible for supervising government finances and strategy .
Meanwhile , the supreme leader has capitalised on the divide between Ahmadinejad and his conservative rivals , quietly encouraging parliament 's recent verbal assault against the president and his advisers in an effort to restore political equilibrium .
At the same time , Khamenei has reaffirmed his support for the president , calling for reconciliation between the conservative - dominated parliament and Ahmadinejad 's administration .
Already , Khamenei has used his constitutional authority to make exceptions , such as allowing Iran 's minister of housing , Ali Nikzad , to serve as caretaker for the transport ministry after parliament impeached its minister in February .
By law , caretaker ministers may be appointed by the president for three months only , and an incumbent minister can not simultaneously serve as caretaker of a second ministry .
Nikzad remained caretaker of the transport ministry for five months and was subsequently approved by parliament when the housing and transport ministries were merged .
In May , Ahmadinejad ousted the ministers of welfare , industry and oil .
He had earlier been rebuked by Khamenei after unilaterally sacking intelligence minister Heydar Moslehi – contrary to the established practice of consulting the supreme leader on intelligence matters .
The dismissal of welfare minister Sadegh Mahsouli was deemed a private victory for the president 's inner circle of advisers , who have sought to eliminate any dissenting voices within the president 's cabinet .
In the runup to Iran 's parliamentary elections next year , Ahmadinejad is expected to escalate his clashes with political rivals inside the traditional conservative establishment and Iran 's judiciary , with the knowledge that doing so will result , at minimum , in a partial political victory for his administration .
The arrest in late June of Mohammad Sharif Malekzadeh and two senior officials who are closely allied to Ahmadinejad 's chief of staff was meant to serve as a warning to the president and his advisers that they have become too bold with the supreme leadership and too willing to bypass the legislature .
All three officials have remained in state custody , which is significant because it means the president has not yet been able to get them out .
Even as conservatives magnify their efforts to regain political influence , Ahmadinejad will continue his own attempts to shore up his government 's control over day - to - day administration .
But conservatives will continue to push back against any political gains that Ahmadinejad makes , a veteran analyst and government adviser in Tehran tells me .
"" If the choice is between Ahmadinejad heading towards becoming almighty , or internal political turmoil , then they will opt for turmoil . """
2011-07-27,"A senior commander of Iran 's revolutionary guards , who is subject to comprehensive international sanctions , has been nominated as the country 's oil minister , a position that currently includes the presidency of Opec .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the Iranian president , sent a list of four ministers , including Rostam Ghasemi , commander of the revolutionary guards ' Khatam al - Anbia military and industrial base , to the parliament for approval , the semi - official Fars news agency reported .
Should the parliament confirm Ghasemi 's nomination next week , the commander , who is targeted by US , EU and Australian sanctions , will be automatically appointed as head of Opec , giving the revolutionary guards access to an influential international platform .
Under Iran 's constitution the president is in charge of appointing cabinet ministers , who take office after the approval of parliament .
Iran took the Opec presidency in October last year , its first time at the head of the oil exporters ' cartel since the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
Unrest in the Middle East , especially the ongoing war in Libya , has given Opec a crucial role in determining the current oil price .
Iran is the second - largest crude oil exporter in Opec .
The nomination follows an extraordinary power struggle between Ahmadinejad and Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Ahmadinejad attempted to take over the oil ministry as its temporary head in May but his move was blocked by parliament .
He then appointed Mohammad Aliabadi , a close ally , as a caretaker .
By involving the revolutionary guards – who are under the control of Khamenei – in his cabinet , Ahmadinejad might be trying to alleviate the tensions with those of Khamenei 's supporters who have been threatening the president with impeachment .
The revolutionary guards have won significant economic power since Ahmadinejad took office in 2005 .
The organisation has signed contracts with the government in fields such as oil , gas and telecommunications .
Khatam al - Anbia 's involvement in the country 's gas field developments exceeds $ 7bn ( £ 4.3bn ) , according to the Economist Intelligence Unit .
In an interview with Fars on Wednesday , Ghasemi said the revolutionary guards would also work as a contractor with the oil ministry if his nomination were approved by parliament .
"" We have strong and skilful people working for Khatam al - Anbia who are capable of taking up oil - related projects and I do n't have any concerns over the activities of the base , "" he was quoted by Fars as saying after the news of his nomination broke out .
Khatam al - Anbia , the construction arm of the revolutionary guards which is already in control of some of the country 's most important recent oil and gas contracts , was mentioned in a list of Iranian institutions targeted by UN sanctions .
Revolutionary guards ' assets , including those personally owned by Ghasemi and dozens of his colleagues , have been blacklisted by the US Treasury and western powers .
Other officials in Ahmadinejad 's cabinet have been also subject to international sanctions including the foreign minister , Ali Akbar Salehi , the defence minister , Ahmad Vahidi , and the vice - president , Fereidoun Abbasi Davani .
In a letter addressed to the parliamentary speaker , Ali Larijani , Ahmadinejad also nominated Mohsen Abadi as the minister for sports and youth , Abdolreza Sheikholeslami as the minister for co - operative , labour and social welfare , and Mehdi Gazanfari as the minister of industries , mines and trade ."
2011-08-03,"A senior Iranian revolutionary guards commander targeted by international sanctions has taken over the presidency of Opec after he became Iran 's oil minister on Wednesday .
Rostam Ghasemi , head of the Khatam al - Anbia military and industrial base , was one of four ministersnominated by president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to join his cabinet last week and approved by Iran 's conservative - dominated parliament .
Ghasemi is currently subject to US , EU and Australian sanctions and his assets have been blacklisted by US Treasury and western powers .
He took 216 votes from the 246 deputies present in the 290-seat parliament .
Iranian state media interpreted the vote as a reaction by Iran 's parliament to international sanctions against the country , especially those which have targeted the revolutionary guards and the country 's nuclear programme .
"" The clever and decisive vote of Iranian MPs for engineer Ghasemi to become the oil minister is a meaningful and crucial response to the attacks against the guards from the west 's media empire , "" said Ramedan Sharif , the head of the revolutionary guards public relations ' unit , in quotes carried by Iran 's semi - official Fars news agency .
In a parliamentary debate before the vote , however , Ali Motahari , a prominent conservative MP who has previously threatened to impeach Ahmadinejad , spoke out against the involvement of the revolutionary guards in Iran 's politics . ""
The integration of the guard , as a military force , in political and economic power is not in the interests of the system , "" Motahari told the parliament . ""
In neighboring countries , military officials are distancing themselves from politics and power , while it 's the opposite in Iran . ""
The appointment of Ghasemi as Iran 's oil minister automatically makes him the head of Opec which has a crucial role in determining oil prices .
As its second - largest crude oil exporter , Iran took the presidency of Opec after 36 years last October and Ghasemi 's position will give the revolutionary guards a unique opportunity to influence an international organisation ."

2011-08-10,"Having already offered to send an expert team to investigate human rights abuses amid the riots , the Iranian regime has gone one step further and called on the UN security council to intervene over the British government 's handling of the unrest rocking the country .
Speaking to reporters after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday , Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , condemned the British government for its "" violent suppression "" of the protesters and called for an end to what he described as the "" killing and brutal beating "" of "" the opposition "" angry with the government 's financial policies . ""
The real opposition are the people who are beaten up and killed on the streets of London , those whose voices are not heard by anyone , "" Iran 's Irna state news agency quoted Ahmadinejad as saying .
The foreign ministry , went so far as to issue a statement advising against any unnecessary travel to the UK .
On Tuesday night , conservative websites sympathetic to the Islamic regime called on the Iranian government to offer refuge in its embassy in London to "" UK protesters in need of protection "" .
In the aftermath of Iran 's disputed presidential election in 2009 , some European embassies in Tehran opened their doors to opposition protesters .
Iranian officials infuriated by the UK 's condemnation of Iran 's human rights violations in recent years , have found a unique opportunity with recent events to get back at the British government by criticising the police force for "" exercising violence "" .
The Iranian opposition , on the other hand , has accused the regime of hypocrisy and opportunism in "" deliberately portraying rioting and looting as political protests "" .
Ahmadinejad criticised the UN security council for remaining silent over the riots in Britain .
"" What else should happen for the security council to react and condemn one of its own members ? ""
He accused the UK authorities of portraying its opposition as a group of "" looters , rioters and drug dealers "" , adding : "" Does Britain have this extent of drug dealers ?
If this is the case , they should be tried and UN should build walls surrounding their country . ""
Ahmadinejad said the protests were the result of London 's imperialist policies of the past three centuries and of ignoring the poor . ""
Time is up for few capitalist families with different titles to loot other nations and governments and making them slaves , "" he said .
"" Instead of giving up their wealth to control their deficit , the burden has been put on masses .
There are pressures in crisis and it 's evident that people would protest in such a situation , "" he said .
Ahmadinejad said British officials should stop meddling in other people 's affairs and instead worry about their own . ""
Instead of interfering in others ' affairs in Afghanistan , Iraq and attacking Libya , they should deal with their own people . ""
He asked Britain to listen to the demands of its people and criticised human rights organisations for remaining silent over the violence used against British protesters .
In reaction to Ahmadinejad 's remarks , Masih Alinejad , an Iranian journalist who lives in exile in Oxford , said : "" Iranians see Ahmadinejad 's comments as a joke for two reasons : firstly because the regime recently refused to allow the UN human rights special rapporteur to visit Iran and investigate the killing of protesters and secondly because they banned independent media from covering Iranian protests after Iran 's 2009 election and arrested many of them while people see scenes of UK riots freely . ""
At the same time , an Iranian member of the parliament who chairs its human rights committee accused the British police of adopting a "" racist "" approach towards "" protesters "" , Iran 's state - run Press TV reported .
Fars , a semi - official news agency close to the elite revolutionary guards , has conveyed much of the Iranian officials ' schadenfreude over the UK riots .
The agency has repeatedly reported that "" UK protests "" are akin to the "" Islamic awakening "" that has been felt across the Arab world .
Iran 's supreme leader , Seyed Ali Khamenei , used the term "" Islamic awakening "" to describe the Arab uprisings and Fars said Khamenei had predicted "" UK protests "" when he said in the past that "" the Islamic awakening "" would eventually hit Europe . ""
As Supreme Leader said popular uprisings will spread to the heart of Europe and today we are witnessing that Britain is experiencing popular protests , "" an Iranian MP , Mohammad Karami - Raad , said in quotes carried by Fars .
Meanwhile , Iranian officials unveiled a book called "" UK 's Role in the 2009 Crisis "" which examines what the Iranian regime says was the role of the UK government in orchestrating protests in the aftermath of Iran 's presidential election , the semi - official Ibna news agency reported ."
2011-08-18,"When the authorities in charge of San Francisco 's Bart subway system shut down cellphone service last week to defuse an anticipated protest , they may not have realised they were the first government agency in the United States to employ a tactic that many associate , as Amy Goodman noted here this week , with the dictatorial regimes of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Hosni Mubarak .
But shut down the phones they did , and in so doing , turned the tragic ( if only locally noted ) death of Charles Hill into a national debate over the degree to which mobile communications technology is protected by our right to free speech .
Hill , who was shot and killed by police on a San Francisco Bart platform in July , was homeless and mentally ill – a poster child for the marginalised .
Bart 's cellphone shutdown , on the other hand , was felt by anyone reliant on their cellphone – which is to say nearly everyone .
But Hill 's death and the communications blackout have at least this much in common : both make Bart a scarier place to be .
Transportation networks in general , and public bus and train systems in particular , are the veins and arteries of any city .
Neighbourhoods can be rich or poor , vibrant or blighted , remote or central , but transit transcends these divisions .
If someone sprays graffiti on a Bart train in Fremont , in minutes it will be carried to downtown San Francisco .
The same is true of fear : it is impossible to shoot and kill a man on a train platform in Oakland , as a police officer did in 2009 , without causing riders to wonder when such violence might come to them .
Bart 's cell phone shutdown prompts such fears on a national scale .
In this case , Bart deactivated cell signal repeaters it owns , and took this action in the defined space of one its stations .
But what happens when a protest is planned around an above - ground train , or on a bus ?
Will authorities feel entitled to ask service providers to cut the signal to whole parts of a city ?
Questions like these remain unanswered because mobile communications are redefining speech as the first amendment struggles to keep up .
Bart spokesman Linton Johnson , who has been credited with suggesting the signal shutdown , has called phone service in Bart 's underground stations an "" amenity "" .
Indeed , there 's no doubt it was installed as a courtesy and a convenience , but it facilitates a kind of multifaceted speech that can not so easily be taken away .
By cutting the phone signal , Bart simultaneously jeopardised all three points of the free speech trifecta : speech , freedom of the press and the right to assemble .
The authors of the US 's Bill of Rights could not have predicted the capabilities of the iPhone or its peers , but the language of the first amendment is instructive .
Freedom of the press , commonly mistaken to mean the freedom of journalistic institutions to print what they will , is , in fact , an individual 's right to print and distribute any message – in other words , a free press is the exercise of free speech on paper .
Given that the founders included the technology of writing in their conception of speech , it is reasonable to suppose that they would mean for it to extend to subsequent communications technologies as well .
The printing press itself is a relic , but the right to communicate freely using text - based media is more important than ever , as rapid - fire technologies like text messaging and Twitter give written language the same urgency as spoken words .
Meanwhile , the cellphone rights debate may be distracting us from the far more disturbing question that catalysed this whole controversy : why are police killing so many Bart passengers ?
Police officers have shot and killed three people in and around its trains in the last three years .
By comparison , the police serving New York 's vast subway system have managed to avoid killing anyone in the last ten years , despite New York 's serving 15 times as many riders .
New York 's Metropolitan Transit Association , by the way , plans to begin fitting its subway stations with cellphone transmitters this fall .
Let us hope they are watching Bart 's actions closely .
At this point , everyone else is ."
2011-08-25,"Syrian forces beat up a prominent Syrian political cartoonist and left him bleeding on the side of a road , in the latest episode of a campaign to quash dissent against the regime of President Bashar al - Assad .
Ali Ferzat , 60 , is one of the Arab world 's most famous cultural figures , and his drawings have pushed at the boundaries of freedom of expression in Syria .
The attack on Ferzat came as the Iranian leader , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , called for a dialogue between Assad and the opposition to bring a peaceful end to the protests .
Working from a gallery in central Damascus , Ferzat has long criticised the bureaucracy and corruption of the Syrian and other Arab regimes – earning him a death threat from former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein .
Since March he has turned to depicting the uprising .
In the early hours of Thursday , masked men seized Ferzat from the street and forced him in to a van .
A relative has said that Ferzat 's attackers targeted his hands , breaking them both , and told him it was "" just a warning "" before leaving him by the roadside with a bag over his head .
In a galvanising moment similar to when the corpse of 13-year - old Hamza al - Khateeb was returned to his parents bearing marks of severe torture in May , Syrians have been expressing outrage .
Messages have circulated online and some Facebook users changed their profile picture to a photograph of Ferzat in hospital .
The dissident artist , who once described himself as having a friendship with Assad , warned in 2007 of an impending "" monumental crisis "" if the regime did not reform .
He has since become increasingly critical of the regime and its brutal crackdown .
In a recent cartoon he criticised the regime 's offers of reforms , with a picture of an official with rosebuds in his speech bubble – and a turd in his head .
Another cartoon showed Assad hurriedly painting railway tracks to escape from a fast - approaching train .
His most recent picture showed Assad trying to hitch a lift with outgoing Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi .
Assad has shrugged off international condemnation and continues to use security forces and thugs to kill and arrest his opponents .
Arrests and raids continued across the country on Thursday with at least five people shot dead across the country and tanks sent into al - Boukamal on the Iraqi border , activists said .
Until now Ahmadinejad has refused to intervene in Syria , a regional ally it fears losing should the Assad regime fall .
But in a rare public statement about the uprising , he told a Lebanese TV station : "" What happened in Libya is what the west wants to happen to Syria too ... for this reason the Syrian people and the government should be conscious and try to solve their problems together and do their reforms themselves . ""
At least 2,200 people have been killed since mid - March , says the UN .
On Wednesday , the EU imposed sanctions against Iran 's elite Quds Force , saying it is helping crush the revolt .
Outspoken cultural figures have in the past been able to get away with more criticism than others .
But in recent weeks , several artists , writers and actors have been arrested .
Last month , Ibrahim al - Qashoush , the composer of a popular anti - regime song in Hama , was found dead with his vocal chords removed .
"" At this stage , fame may be more of a danger than a protection because the regime does not want any prominent figure to come to the fore and provide a public face for the revolution , "" said Ammar Abdulhamid , a US - based dissident and son of Syrian actor Mona Wasif .
Ferzat was born in Hama , where a tank assault on the eve of Ramadan to reinstate government control prompted widespread outrage .
A graduate of Damascus University 's faculty of fine arts , his initial work in the 1970s appeared in state - run newspapers .
By 1980 his cartoons were being published in the French newspaper Le Monde , earning global recognition , exhibitions and prizes .
In a 2001 interview with the Guardian , Ferzat recalled that before becoming president , Assad visited one of his exhibitions and said that some of the cartoons banned in Syria should have been published .
He also published satirical paper al - Domar ( Lamplighter ) , which ran from late 2000 until he was forced to close it in 2003 .

2011-09-06,"The picture looks like a 16th - century Persian miniature .
The wise man on the right is lecturing his companions who kneel dutifully in front of him , listening to his sermon .
But something is not quite right .
On second look , it becomes clear that all the characters are in fact recognisable to modern - day Iranians .
Indeed , the wise man is none other than Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's confidant , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei .
And in an obvious satire of the country 's political leaders , it is Mashaei who counts the president among his obedient followers – not the other way round .
The image appeared on the front page of an Iranian magazine , Shahrvand - e - Emrooz , a month ago .
But now it seems the Iranian regime has taken offence , and it is widely believed the picture was the reason behind the enforced closure of the magazine on Monday .
Shahrvand - e - Emrooz was previously shut down , along with several other titles , after the unrest that followed the 2009 elections , but resumed publication recently .
Another publication , Roozegar , was also closed on Monday .
The picture highlights the concerns among Iranian conservatives over Mashaei 's growing political influence .
Supporters of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , believe that Mashaei , whose daughter is married to the president 's son , is attempting to undermine clerical power in Iran .
Opponents of Mashaei , who favours cultural openness , say he has the president under his "" spell "" and have accused his team of anything from corruption to sorcery .
Several of Mashaei 's close allies and some senior aides to the president have been arrested in recent months .
Ahmadinejad 's unwavering support for Mashaei has infuriated conservatives and has even cost him the support of Khamenei .
In the past six months , a power struggle has developed between Ahmadinejad and Khamenei , which is widely believed to have stemmed from Mashaei 's influence .
Analysts believe Ahmadinejad had been grooming Mashaei to succeed him in the next presidential elections , due in two years , but that has now become unlikely .
Khamanei is also believed to have chosen to get along with Ahmadinejad rather than orchestrate a feud over Mashaei in an effort to avoid unrest during the elections .
Iran 's opposition believes that by focusing on Mashaei and his relatively liberal views , Ahmadinejad is trying to find a way to attract votes and preserve his dwindling power .
Analysts say Ahmadinejad and his team are casting their eyes on the period after Khamenei 's death .
Tehran 's regime has given more space to opposition newspapers in recent weeks in a move to appease them in the runup to parliamentary elections .
But it would appear that Shahrvand - e - Emrooz and Roozegar have gone too far in pushing the limits in criticising the government .
In the picture , Mashaei who appears to be in a Safavid dynasty - era costume , is sitting close to Hamid Baghaei , Ahmadinejad 's executive deputy , who is shown as a handsome male companion .
Iranian bloggers have also joked about Ahmadinejad 's relationship with Mashaei , which is often described as affectionate .
Roozegar is believed to have been closed for publishing an interview with an Iranian politician analyst , Morad Saghafi , who referred to the 2009 post - election unrest .
Reporters Without Borders on Tuesday condemned the closure of the publications and the ongoing imprisonment of Iranian journalists and bloggers . ""
Despite some conciliatory gestures , the Iranian authorities continue to crack down on the media and journalists , closing the weekly Shahrvand e - Emrooz and the daily Roozegar yesterday , "" it said .
Iran remains one of the world 's worst jailers of journalists , according to the Committee to Protect Journalists , which campaigns for press freedom ."
2011-09-15,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has been forced to deny that his protege was involved in a $ 2.6bn ( £ 1.64bn ) bank fraud , described as the country 's biggest ever financial scam .
The president 's official website on Thursday issued a statement , saying his chief of staff and close confidant , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , was not linked to the scandal , which has dominated the headlines in Tehran in the past few days .
It emerged recently that Iranian regulators had frozen the assets of a businessman , identified by some local media as Amir - Mansour Aria , accused of forging documents in order to obtain credit estimated at around 30tn rials from various financial institutions , including Bank Saderat Iran , one of the largest financial institutions in the Middle East .
It is reported that Aria used the credit to buy state - owned companies such as the Khuzestan steel company during the government 's controversial privatisation scheme , which started in 2004 .
Some conservative websites published a leaked letter reportedly signed by Mashaei , in which he appears to give the go - ahead for the purchase of a state - owned steel company by a private company without the necessary formal procedures .
The statement from the president 's office said Mashaei had done nothing wrong . ""
In continuation of damaging policies against the dedicated government , some newspapers and chain websites have discussed the issue of the banking scam ' which had been investigated and found by the government ' in order to spread lies and propaganda … and accusing the clean and anti - corruption government of being involved in it , "" the statement said .
The fraud comes at the time when the president and his allies are caught in the middle of a bitter power struggle with conservatives close to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Some supporters of Khamenei believe that Mashaei is trying to increase his political influence by undermining clerical power and appealing to young people by advocating greater cultural openness .
Some analysts speculated that Ahmadinejad was grooming Mashaei to succeed him in the next presidential elections .
In its attempt to distance Mashaei from the scam , the statement said it reserved the right to file a complaint against the website Mashregh , the semi - official Fars news agency and newspapers including Keyhan and Tehran Emrooz , which played a key role in revealing the financial scandal in recent days .
Fars is believed to be affiliated to the revolutionary guards and the head of Keyhan is appointed directly by the supreme leader .
Some analysts believe privatisation has become a cover - up for redistributing the previously state - owned sectors among regime factions and various groups close to the establishment .
However , the IMF in June published a statement in which it praised the economic policies of Ahmadinejad , saying the government had been successful "" in reducing inequalities , improving living standards and supporting domestic demand "" ."
2011-09-20,"The annual trip to the United Nations in New York will this year be a rite of passage for more than one leader .
The spotlight is on the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , but in its own way Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's pilgrimage will be just as instructive .
Last year , he flew into New York brimming with lines to lambast and provoke .
He was the Islamic republic 's trusted messenger .
This year , if Ahmadinejad represents any faction in Iran it is one that has been branded "" a deviant current "" .
His political backers have been arrested , his chief of staff accused of involvement in a £ 1.64bn bank fraud , undermining clerical power and even sorcery .
Iran 's other power centres , such as the Revolutionary Guards , have distanced themselves from their errant protege .
Or , to put it another way , Ahmadinejad has fallen out with his former patron , Iran 's supreme leader Ali Khamenei – big time .
The rift became public in April , but Ahmadinejad had long been thought to be grooming his chief of staff , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , as his successor .
Ahmadinejad , whose presidency is limited to two terms , must step down in 2013 .
Between now and then there are the parliamentary elections in March next year .
The power battle broke out over three cabinet appointments over which the supreme leader holds sway – the foreign , intelligence and interior ministries .
The president sacked his foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki , a Khamenei favourite , in December .
When he tried to do the same to the intelligence minister Heydar Moslehi , Khamenei ordered his reinstatement .
Ahmadinejad went on strike for 11 days but was forced to reinstate Moslehi , although the two have not been seen in cabinet together since .
Mashaei is a threat to the clerics on more than one level .
His nationalism draws its source from Iran 's pre - Islamic history , and he is believed to have played a key role in securing the loan from the British Museum of the Cyrus Cylinder , considered the first human rights charter .
If he has become the face of the opposition , it should not be forgotten that this is a power battle within the elite .
The Green movement , which rocked the regime in 2009 , is exhausted as a political force .
Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , both under house arrest for seven months , are urging a boycott of next year 's parliamentary elections .
But they have been reduced to the role of observers .
The UN could usefully use Ahmadinejad 's presence to remind him of his country 's refusal to let in a human rights rapporteur to monitor Iran 's appalling record .
It executes two people a day .
But just as probably , Ahmadinejad 's beleaguered band might want to apply for asylum .
They face arrest back home ."
2011-09-20,"The Nobel - prize winning author Gabriel García Márquez is revered for his evocation of a surreal and sometimes dangerous world where nothing is quite what it seems .
In this case , however , the country in question is not his native Colombia but Iran under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Copies of Márquez 's 1996 work News of a Kidnapping have sold out from bookshops in Tehran this week after detained opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi said the book 's description of Colombian kidnappings offers an accurate reflection of his life under house arrest .
Mousavi and fellow opposition leader Mehdi Karroubi have been under house arrest since mid - February when thousands of Iranians poured onto the streets in response to their calls for fresh protests in solidarity with pro - democracy movements in the Arab world .
Since then , they have had little access to the outside world .
But Mousavi was allowed a brief meeting with his daughters last week , for the first time in seven months .
The brief encounter took place in the presence of security officials but Mousavi reportedly told his daughters : "" If you want to know about my situation in captivity , read Gabriel García Márquez 's News of a Kidnapping . ""
Mousavi 's comments spread quickly across Iran 's huge online community , prompting hundreds of opposition supporters to seek out the book .
Queues formed in some bookshops , and copies of the book sold out within days .
One Tehran - based journalist said : "" It took me couple of hours to find a copy of the book .
I first went to bookshops in the Karimkhan area , but none had a copy left .
I went to Enghelab Avenue
and I was amazed to see people queuing up to buy the book as if they were queuing up to buy a new Harry Potter .
"" At least 10 large bookshops in the capital told the Guardian their stocks of the book had sold out .
None of them would say why .

"" News of a Kidnapping , which was initially published in English in 1997 , describes the abduction in the early 1990s of high - profile Colombians , including journalists and politicians , on the orders of the drug kingpin Pablo Escobar .
A news website , Aftab , listed the book at the top of bestseller chart last Thursday and Shargh , a reformist newspaper , reported an unprecedented demand for the book in big bookshops in Tehran .
García Márquez reacted to the news by sharing on his Facebook page a blogpost about the episode by an Iranian reporter .
Supporters of Mousavi have also launched a Facebook page , called "" News of a Kidnapping , the status of a president in captivity "" , where readers have posted sections of the book .
Some websites have put the Farsi translation of the book online for free download .
Supporters of Mousavi and Karroubi describe their status as "" an abduction "" and have called on the UN to investigate their disappearances .
They believe Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , was directly involved in them being placed under house arrest without any judicial ruling ."
2011-09-21,"With many former Middle East strongmen finding themselves indisposed after the Arab spring , all UN eyes on Friday will be fixed on Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iranian president , diplomatic headache and effortless controversialist .
In all his addresses to the general assembly in New York , Ahmadinejad has demonstrated an undeniable knack for making an impression and propelling audience heads into hands .
At his first appearance six years ago , he launched a barely veiled attack on the US , telling delegates : "" State terrorism is being supported by those who claim to fight terrorism . ""
A few weeks later , he informed a conference titled The World
Without Zionism that "" the regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time "" .
In 2006 , Ahmadinejad took to the UN podium to lambast the US 's "" hegemonic power "" and influence over the UN and to pose the question : "" If the governments of the US or the UK , who are permanent members of the security council , commit aggression , occupation and violation of international law , which of the organs of the UN can take them to account ? ""
The next year , his request to visit Ground Zero to lay a wreath to commemorate the September 11 attacks was turned down .
In 2008 , he accused Israel of manipulating the US presidential race , suggesting that "" a small but deceitful minority of Zionists are playing with the American public "" .
His presence at the general assembly in September 2009 provoked a series of diplomatic walkouts after he again attacked Israel , accusing it of genocide , barbarism and racism .
Ahmadinejad upped the ante still further last year — and prompted another exodus from the chamber — when he claimed most nations believed the September 11 attacks were the work of the US government .
He told the assembly that there was a theory "" that some segments within the US government orchestrated the attack to reverse the declining American economy , and its grips on the Middle East , in order to save the Zionist regime "" .
In slightly more measured terms , President Barack Obama described the accusations as "" hateful , offensive and inexcusable "" ."
2011-09-22,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the Iranian president , has launched a stinging attack at the United Nations on the US and other major powers as militarist , imperialist and unfit to dominate global governance .
Ahmadinejad 's verbal assault on the west and Israel promoted walkouts by diplomatic delegations .
US diplomats were the first to leave , when Ahmadinejad referred to the "" mysterious September 11 incident "" as a pretext to attack Afghanistan and Iraq .
Later , he criticised the US for killing Osama bin Laden and burying his body at sea , saying the al - Qaida leader should have been brought to trial .
Other delegations , including those from the UK and France , walked out later when the Iranian leader said that if European countries were still paying a "" fine or ransom to the Zionists "" because of the Holocaust , they should also pay reparations for slavery .
In other parts of his speech he spoke of Zionists being responsible for "" mass murder and terror against the Palestinians "" , and said the US and west "" view Zionism as a sacred notion and ideology "" .
The Israeli delegation had decided not to attend .
Ahmadinejad , apparently in an attempt to strengthen his political position in Iran , dedicated much of what is likely to be judged as one of his most controversial speeches to asking rhetorical questions about who was responsible for slavery , colonialism and wars over the generations .
He also asked which countries ' economies relied on military spending ; who provoked Saddam Hussein to attack Iran ; and "" who used the atomic bomb against defenceless people ? ""
Ahmadinejad accused Nato of occupying Afghanistan and of sanctioning drug trafficking , claiming that narcotics production has risen since the US - led invasion a decade ago .
Later , he accused the US and its allies of targeting Iran , which is under sanction over its nuclear programme , because it has challenged orthodoxy . ""
By using their imperialistic media network which is under the influence of colonialism , they threaten anyone who questions the Holocaust and the September 11 event with sanctions and military actions , "" he said .
The Iranian leader said this made the US and its allies unfit to dominate the international system , and called for change to the structure of the UN security council .
But he made no direct reference to the issue that has dominated diplomatic wrangling in New York this week – the Palestinian request for statehood to the security council .
The Palestinian leader , Mahmoud Abbas , is expected to lay out his case for going to the security council in a speech to the UN on Friday , while insisting it is not meant as an alternative to negotiations .
Abbas is also expected to say that the move is not a threat to Israel .
That is not how the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , sees it .
He may use his speech , later in the day on Friday , to repeat his assertion that the security council move is destabilising , could result in false expectations and violence , and undermines the negotiating process .
The tone of the two leaders ' speeches will be set in part by Barack Obama 's address on Wednesday , which was strongly praised by Israel but has been met with widespread criticism among UN delegations , many of whom regard it as a piece of electioneering as the US president seeks to defuse Republican criticism that he has not backed Israel strongly enough .
Critics said the tone of the American president 's remarks , and his failure to speak directly about occupation or mention the continued construction of Jewish settlements , added weight to a call by the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , for an end to US domination of mediation in the conflict .
Abbas is expected to submit the request to the security council after his speech , but the Palestinians have backed away from pressing for an immediate vote , under intense pressure – particularly from Europe – to avoid forcing the US to carry out a threat to veto the move and to give a breathing space to try and relaunch peace negotiations .
The Palestinians also have reason to pause , because it is not certain that they have enough votes to win in the security council whether or not the US vetoes the request .
Abbas needs the support of nine of the 15 members , but not all have publicly declared their position .
Some of those thought to be sympathetic to the Palestinian position – notably Bosnia and Gabon – are under intense pressure from the US to abstain .
However , while Netanyahu received strong backing from the White House , the Israeli prime minister was warned by his predecessor , Ehud Olmert , that he is facing his last chance to make peace , and he should not be wasting political capital opposing the Palestinian request to the security council . ""
As tensions grow , I can not but feel that we in the region are on the verge of missing an opportunity – one that we can not afford to miss , "" Olmert wrote in an article for the New York Times . ""
The Israeli prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , has declared publicly that he believes in the two - state solution , but he is expending all of his political effort to block Mr Abbas 's bid for statehood by rallying domestic support and appealing to other countries .
This is not the wisest step Mr Netanyahu can take . ""
Olmert said the Arab spring is changing the political dynamic in the Middle East , and that it is important for Israel to cement existing peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan , as well as reaching a deal with the Palestinians .
"" We Israelis simply do not have the luxury of spending more time postponing a solution .
A further delay will only help extremists on both sides who seek to sabotage any prospect of a peaceful , negotiated two - state solution , "" Olmert said ."
2011-09-22,"All eyes are once again on the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
He is expected , again , to exploit the high - profile iglobal platform given to him during his speech to the UN general assembly .
Unlike last year , however , when he sought to grab international headlines , Ahmadinejad is likely to play to a domestic audience in an attempt to bolster his leadership and quash suggestions that he has become a lame - duck president two years before his term ends in 2013 .
Last week , in the latest confrontation with conservatives close to the country 's spiritual leader and highest authority , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , he failed to fulfil a pledge to release the US hikers held in Iran accused of spying .
Ahmadinejad had been hoping the release would take place before his visit to New York , so he would win any credit following the release .
Instead , he was embarrassed by the judiciary , which contradicted his remarks and insisted they would make the final decision on the fate of the Americans , Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal .
But Ahmadinejad 's dilemma back in Iran is more complex than the controversy around the release of two westerners .
After publicly challenging Khamenei over a cabinet appointment in April , Ahmadinejad abruptly lost his position as the protege of the Ayatollah .
Since then he has become increasingly isolated , with only a handful of reliable supporters .
He has also lost the support of the elite Revolutionary Guards and the majority of his backers in parliament and the wider establishment .
Aside from these continuing feuds , Ahmadinejad and his team – in particular his chief of staff and close confidant , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , and deputy , Hamid Baghaei – who have accompanied him on his visit to New York - are facing some of the most serious accusations at home .
Supporters of Khamenei are worried about the influence of Ahmadinejad 's regime on Iranian politics , accusing it of everything from revolutionary deviancy to financial corruption and even sorcery .
Mashaei , who is often referred to as the head of a "" deviant current "" within the president 's inner circle and viewed as Iran 's "" real "" president , is the focus of criticism due to his relatively liberal views .
He is accused of trying to undermine clerical power and seeking to appeal to younger Iranians by advocating a freer society .
Mashaei has also been accused of involvement in a $ 2.6bn ( £ 1.7bn ) banking scam , described as Iran 's biggest ever financial fraud .
Ahmadinejad and Mashaei , whose many allies have been arrested in recent months , face a serious challenge in Iran .
It seems that Khamenei has chosen to tolerate them until the end of Ahmadinejad 's term to avoid major public confrontation before parliamentary elections in 2012 and presidential elections in 2013 .
Ahmadinejad 's troubles were further highlighted when it emerged that speculation is rife among Iranian MPs that there will be a move to bring back the position of prime minister , thus replacing the current system of presidency .
If this turns out to be the case , it would constitute an attempt by MPs to take power , as any prime minister would be appointed by them , unlike a president , who is elected by the people .
Speaking at the UN will give Ahmadinejad a good opportunity to fight back against his opponents .
During his stay in New York he has been bombarded by interview requests from US media and may be viewing this as a chance to distract attention from his poor record in Iran , especially the appalling violations of human rights .
Ironically , Ahmadinejad is not receiving the attention he needs at home , with even semi - official media giving scant coverage to his visit to the UN .
To ensure domestic publicity , Ahmadinejad is likely to discuss one of the biggest global controversies of them all – Palestinian statehood and Barack Obama 's apparent support for the Israelis .
He may also wish to bring up the US and Britain 's apparent lack of interest in uprisings in Bahrain and Yemen ."
2011-09-27,"Two - time Oscar - winner Sean Penn was involved in the release of the two American hikers held in Iran on espionage charges , according to Reuters .
Penn flew to Venezuela in the hope of convincing President Hugo Chávez to approach Tehran .
Chávez is close to Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , while Penn has met the Venezuelan president on a number of occasions .
Venezuela 's deputy foreign minister , Temir Porras , told Reuters last week that an "" American intellectual "" had spoken to Chávez about the case of Joshua Fattal and Shane Bauer , who were freed on Wednesday after two years in custody .
Penn 's spokesman later confirmed that the intellectual in question was the star , who won Oscars for Mystic River and Milk .
A source told Reuters : "" Penn was very committed to the case …
He flew to Caracas several months ago to raise it with Chávez and he kept on it . ""
Fattal and Bauer were arrested in July 2009 on the border with Iraq , where they said they had been hiking .
Penn is well known for his political activism and has spent time in both Venezuela and Cuba visiting Chávez and Raúl Castro .
He was a fierce critic of George W Bush during the latter 's time in office .
He made a visit to Iran just before the 2005 presidential election as a journalist on an assignment for the San Francisco Chronicle ."
2011-09-28,"Al - Qaida has sent a message to the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , asking him to stop spreading conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attacks .
Iranian media on Wednesday reported quotes from what appears to be an article published in the latest issue of the al - Qaida English language magazine , Inspire , which described Ahmadinejad 's remarks over the 11 September attacks as "" ridiculous "" .
In his UN general assembly speech last week , Ahmadinejad cast doubt over the official version of the 2001 attacks .
"" The Iranian government has professed on the tongue of its president Ahmadinejad that it does not believe that al - Qaida was behind 9/11 but rather , the US government , "" the article said , according to Iranian media . ""
So we may ask the question : why would Iran ascribe to such a ridiculous belief that stands in the face of all logic and evidence ? ""
Ahmadinejad said in New York that the "" mysterious September 11 incident "" had been used as a pretext to attack Afghanistan and Iraq .
He had also previously expressed scepticism at the US version of events . ""
By using their imperialistic media network which is under the influence of colonialism , they threaten anyone who questions the Holocaust and the September 11 event with sanctions and military actions , "" said Ahmadinejad .
The al - Qaida article insisted it had been behind the attacks and criticised the Iranian president for discrediting the terrorist group . ""
For them , al - Qaida was a competitor for the hearts and minds of the disenfranchised Muslims around the world , "" said the article published in the Inspire magazine . ""
Al - Qaida … succeeded in what Iran could n't .
Therefore it was necessary for the Iranians to discredit 9/11 and what better way to do so ?
Conspiracy theories . ""
Al - Qaida also accused Iran of hypocrisy over its "" anti - Americanism "" .
The article said : "" For Iran , anti - Americanism is merely a game of politics .
It is anti - America when it suits it
and it is a collaborator with the US when it suits it , as we have seen in the shameful assistance Iran gave to the US in its invasion of Afghanistan and in the Shia of Iraq , backed by Iran , bringing the American forces into the country and welcoming them with open arms . ""
During his visit to New York , Ahmadinejad also changed his position on gay people in Iran .
He had previously famously said : "" We do n't have homosexuals [ in Iran ] like you do in your country .
This does not exist in our country . ""
But according to the American news website the Daily Beast , in a meeting with a number of journalists last week , he said : "" In Iran , homosexuality is seen as an ugly act …
There may be some people who are homosexuals who are in touch with you .
But in Iranian society they 're ashamed to announce it so they 're not known .
This is an act against God and his prophets .
But we as the government ca n't go out and stop people . """
2011-10-07,"The European Union has been criticised for lifting travel bans on three senior Iranian officials after they were promoted .
Iran 's foreign minister , Ali Akbar Salehi , the nuclear chief , Fereidoun Abbasi - Davani , and the oil minister , Rostam Ghasemi , were all previously subject to EU travel bans but have had their restrictions completely or temporarily lifted .
When Salehi , a former head of Iran 's atomic energy organisation , was appointed by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as the country 's foreign minister in January , questions were raised about his ability to engage with the international community .
But the EU foreign policy chief , Catherine Ashton , soon signalled that Salehi 's travel ban could be lifted in hope of an agreement with Iran over its nuclear programme .
In May , the EU suspended his travel ban to let him carry out his role as an "" interlocutor "" with other countries .
The move came after Germany 's gay foreign minister , Guido Westerwelle , made an unprecedented visit to Tehran , meeting Ahmadinejad , to secure the release of two German reporters held in Iran for illegally working without a press visa .
Few top western diplomats have visited Iran since Ahmadinejad , who is well known for anti - gay comments , took office in 2005 .
Abbasi - Davani , a nuclear scientist who survived an assassination attempt last November that killed one of his colleagues , was given Salehi 's previous job .
Abbasi - Davani was allowed to travel to Vienna in September .
In August , Rostam Ghasemi , a former commander of the elite Revolutionary Guards , an organisation believed to be responsible for the killings and arrests of protesters in the aftermath of Iran 's 2009 elections , took over the presidency of Opec after he became Iran 's oil minister .
Iran currently holds the presidency of the oil cartel .
Ghasemi is expected to appear at an Opec meeting in Vienna in December .
Shadi Sadr , a prominent Iranian activist and lawyer based in London who campaigned for travel restrictions for Iranian officials , said the EU decision would "" make a mockery of travel bans "" .
"" Activists are deeply disappointed by these decisions and think their attempts have been futile , "" she said .
"" What is the point of putting individuals on travel ban if they can get away with it with a job promotion ? ""
She added : "" For activists , the function of imposing travel bans is to name and shame officials involved in suppressing human rights in Iran .
All these three officials are not only involved in Iran 's nuclear programme but also serious violation of rights .
The travel ban is there to make disruption in their official activities .
If not , why is it there ? ""
Barbara Lochbihler , an MEP and the former chair of the Iran delegation at the EU , said the Abbasi - Davani and Ghasemi travel bans had been temporarily lifted so that "" both could take part in international meetings in Vienna "" .
The Foreign Office said the three officials were under nuclear sanctions unconnected to human rights .
The British foreign secretary , William Hague , met Salehi at the UN in September .
The UK has been criticised for not naming the Iranian officials targeted in its new round of travel restrictions .
In recent weeks the Iranian media has suggested Ghasemi 's name had been taken off the travel ban list but a spokesperson for Ashton rejected the claim and said he would be able to travel only to the Opec meeting .
EU regulations say sanctions should not apply "" to cases where a state member is bound by an obligation of international law "" .
Activists believe the EU has not been transparent enough about recent decisions over Iran travel bans and say there is a lack of consistency within the EU over decisions .
"" Some of the EU countries , especially Italy and Germany , have invested in Iran in the past and obviously are reluctant about the bans , "" said a commentator who asked not to be named .
The US is believed to be unhappy about the lifting of bans .
"" I would have preferred to be informed at an earlier stage , in the same way as the public opinion should be instructed on the exact reasons for such decisions , "" said Lochbihler .
"" The EU would make a huge mistake if it decided to isolate Iran completely . ""
Marietje Schaake , an MEP , said : "" The comprehensive package of economic sanctions that were imposed by the international community actually fit quite well to the politics of self - isolation the Iranian regime has pursued . ""
The EU might have eased travel restrictions on Iranian officials in order to secure a future visit to Tehran by a group of MEPs , a diplomatic source told the Guardian .
Meanwhile , the former managing director of Iran 's biggest bank , Mahmoud Reza Khavari , has apparently fled to Canada after being accused of involvement in a $ 2.6bn financial scam .
Sadr said : "" He has dual citizenship .
Officials related to this regime have found their ways to get past international restrictions .
Wealthy officials invest in other countries and get a double citizenship and travel more easily . """
2011-10-09,"An Iranian student activist has been lashed 74 times for insulting President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Peyman Aref , a student of political science at Tehran University , was sentenced in March 2010 to a year in jail after being found guilty of propaganda against the regime for speaking to foreign media .
Aref , who was initially arrested in the aftermath of Iran 's disputed presidential elections in 2009 , was also sentenced to 74 lashes for writing an "" insulting "" letter to Ahmadinejad and given a lifetime ban on working as a journalist or membership of any political parties .
His jail sentence came to an end on Sunday but , hours before his release from Tehran 's notorious Evin prison , Aref was told the lashing would be carried out .
A masked prison guard carried out the lashing in presence of Aref 's wife and officials from Iran 's judiciary .
News of the lashing come only a few weeks after Somayeh Tohidlou , a female Iranian blogger and campaigner for former presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi , was sentenced to a "" symbolic "" lashing for the same crime .
Unlike Tohidlou 's symbolic punishment – designed to humiliate rather than harm –
Aref was indeed whipped .
Pictures taken after his release show his bloodied back covered in wounds .
"" Lashing people sentenced to various charges such as those caught drinking alcohol is common in Iran but political activists are usually lashed for ambiguous charges such as desecrating Islam or prophets , "" said an Iranian journalist based in Tehran who asked not to be named .
"" Lashing Aref for insulting Ahmadinejad is shocking and unprecedented . ""
In a letter to the president during his 2009 election campaign , Aref attacked Ahmadinejad for his crackdown on students who had been politically active at university and barred from continuing with their studies .
Undergraduates and students who had criticised the government were given up to three "" penalty points "" , according to the potential threat they were said to pose .
Aref was among the "" three - starred "" MA students who were not not allowed to continue their studies .
About 150 were starred .
Speaking to the website Rahesabz , Aref said after his release : "" Whenever Ahmadinejad goes to New York [ for UN general assembly ] , he boasts that Iran is the world 's freest country but I was brutally flogged in my country for insulting him . ""
He added : "" [ My crime ] was that I wrote an open letter to Ahmadinejad and reminded him of what he did to the universities . ""
Authorities apparently have taken offence because Aref refused to begin his letter with the formal greeting "" Salam "" as a sign of protest .
Iran 's online community reacted with shock to Aref 's lashing with many people sharing pictures of his back covered in blood on social networking websites .
In a separate incident in Tehran last week , four journalists were arrested .
They have been identified as Ali Akarami , Mehdi Afsharnik , Mohmmad Heydari and Mohsen Hakimi .
Iran 's embassy in London could not be reached on Sunday for comment ."
2011-10-10,"There is a growing chorus of approval among US experts for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's offer of a new uranium deal .
So far the enthusiasm has failed to catch on inside the Obama administration or among the rest of the six - nation group that handles nuclear negotiations with Iran .
But that could change as the months go by and the Iranian government builds up its stockpile of low enriched and medium ( 20 % ) enriched uranium .
Ahmadinejad made this latest offer in the press , first with an interview with the Washington Post in mid - September , and then with the New York Times a week or so later .
The essence of the deal , the Iranian president told the Times ' Nicholas Kristof , was : "" If they give us the 20 % enriched uranium this very week , we will cease the domestic enrichment of uranium of up to 20 percent this very week . ""
The offer is a variant on a series of proposals and counter - proposals on the supply of fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor ( TRR ) , for the production of medical isotopes .
The first version involved Iran shipping out of its low enriched uranium ( LEU ) in return for the 20 % enriched uranium required for the TRR .
Ahmadinejad seemed to back the deal but it crashed on the reefs of internal Iranian politics .
It resurfaced in May 2010 in a proposal brokered by Turkey and Brazil which was rejected by the West when it became clear that Iran intended to continue making 20 % uranium at home .
This was crucial as mastery of 20 % uranium production is said to be 90 % of the way to making weapons - grade ( 90 % enriched ) uranium in terms of technical difficulty .
In this latest reincarnation of the proposal , Ahmadinejad is saying Iran will stop 20 % production .
For that reason , the Washington - based Institute for Science and International Security , argued that it would be wise to pursue the deal , on a temporary trial basis : To test out Ahmadinejad 's offer , the United States could suggest that it would arrange the sale of two - year 's worth of TRR fuel in exchange for a two - year halt to any production of uranium enriched over five percent .
TRR targets for medical isotope production could also be offered for sale to increase interest in the deal .
The idea has been seconded by Ali Faez and Charles Ferguson of the Federation of American Scientists , who suggest supplying Iran with 50 kg of fuel for the TRR unconditionally .
They argue it would be seen as a humanitarian people - to - people gesture , helping 850,000 Iranian cancer patients receive treatment , with the strategic benefit of removing "" Iran 's rationale for refining uranium to more than 3.5 percent "" .
Faez and Ferguson wave away the risk that Ahmadinejad might not have the regime 's full backing for this gambit , as proved to be the case two years ago .
They say Ahmadinejad has "" repeated the offer often enough , and with confirmation from the foreign minister , that it must have the backing of the Iranian political elite , including Khamenei . ""
That argument is debatable .
Some Ahmadinejad watchers counter that he says lots of things without the Supreme Leader 's backing .
The bigger problem is that it easier for academics to take these kind of gambles than leaders .
Obama is in election mode and all foreign policy decisions are being subjected to a sniff test by his political advisors .
Giving Ahmadinejad the benefit of the doubt once more will not sit well in a presidential debate against his eventual Republican challenger .
The rest of the 5 + 1 group ( the P5 and Germany ) have had little to say about the offer , holding fire until there is internal cohesion among the six , but if Iran continues to increase 20 % U production at the present rate , and Israel shows signs of contemplating military action once more , desperation may take the upper hand and the Obama administration will be under increasingly heavy international pressure to take the risk ."
2011-10-12,"Adam Werritty personally arranged a meeting between Liam Fox and a senior Iranian lobbyist with close links to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's regime , the Guardian has learned .
The Iranian lobbyist visited Fox in May 2009 at Portcullis House .
Werritty met him at the entrance of the parliamentary building and escorted him up to Fox 's office , sitting in for half a meeting on Iran . ""
I thought Werritty 's was Fox 's assistant , "" the lobbyist – who declined to be named – told the Guardian . ""
Werritty was the main contact for meeting Fox .
He was the person who arranged the time of the meeting .
He collected me at the gate of Portcullis House and took me up to Fox 's office . ""
There was a meeting between the three of us .
Werritty was n't introduced to me .
I did n't get the impression that Werritty was an especial expert on Iran .
I did n't know who he was but thought he was either an official or Fox 's assistant . ""
The lobbyist declined to reveal what was discussed .
He described Werritty as "" a very pleasant , sociable guy "" .
He said he met Fox briefly twice after he became defence secretary , with others present .
The revelation is nevertheless likely to add to claims not only that Werritty masqueraded as Fox 's international fixer but that he was running a shadow foreign policy on Iran – a policy more hawkish than the official government position .
David Cameron is said to have been annoyed by some of Fox 's more neo - con pronouncements on the subject .
In February , Werritty and Fox flew to Israel for a high - profile strategic conference on regional security .
Fox called for stronger sanctions to compel Iran to give up its nuclear weapons programme .
He warned the Commons during the same period that it was "" entirely possible "" Iran could have a nuclear weapon by 2012 .
Werritty also arranged and attended a dinner at the conference with Fox and Matthew Gould , Britain 's ambassador to Israel .
Other top political figures also attended .
The Independent reported that senior Israeli diplomats were under the impression that Werritty was an official adviser to the defence secretary .
It is not clear why Werritty , rather than Foreign Office officials , organised the dinner .
Werritty attended the same conference in February 2009 as an "" expert "" on Iran .
He was a guest of a UK - based pro - Israeli lobbying organisation .
The British Israel Communications and Research Centre ( Bicom ) paid for his flight and hotel bill .
Lorna Fitzsimmons , Bicom 's chief executive , said : "" We have only ever done two things with Adam Werritty in the five years I have been at Bicom .
We funded him to go to the Herzliya conference in 2009 to talk on a panel on Iran and I accepted an invitation from him to talk to a panel on Iran at an event in London in 2009 or 2010 .
"" It 's unclear , however , how deep Werritty 's Iranian connections are , and on what basis he is a specialist on the region .
Richard Dalton , Britain 's ambassador in Tehran between 2003 - 2006 , said : he had not come across Werritty , either during his time in Iran and subsequently . ""
He has n't broken the surface of Iran expert circles .
I 've never read anything written [ on Iran ] by him . ""
One Iranian exile said that he had met Werritty in London to discuss Iranian politics .
"" We met over coffee several times "" , he said .
"" He [ Werritty ] even spoke a few words of Persian , "" the exile recalled .
A second Iranian exile added that Werritty was a regular participant at seminars on Iran held by Chatham House , the foreign affairs thinktank , and the Royal United Services Institute .
The source said that Werritty had visited Iran once back in 1997 and the Iranian chamber of commerce .
He said that when he met Werritty in 2005 - 2006 he described himself as "" someone very close to Liam Fox "" .
The source added : "" I heard recently from Arab colleagues that Werritty had called himself an adviser to Fox .
I did n't get the impression he was an Iran expert .
He could talk convincingly but I did n't see any depth in his Iran information .
"" It is understood that Bicom paid less than £ 1,000 for Werritty to fly to Israel to attend the 2009 conference , an annual event organised by academics and former luminaries of the country 's intelligence and security establishment to discuss strategic and Middle Eastern issues and promote Israel 's view of them .
Werritty was invited to attend by one of its organisers , Tommy Steiner , a Nato and international relations expert who served as the executive director of the Atlantic Forum of Israel , a network - based policy organization that promoted "" Israel 's relations with the Euro - Atlantic Community "" .
Steiner was unavailable for comment .
Werrity is described in the list of 2009 Herzliya participants as "" Dr Adam Werritty , Advisor , Office of Shadow Defense Secretary ; UK Executive Director , The Atlantic Bridge "" but is not listed as speaking on Iran or anything else .
He does not appear in the list of 2011 participants .
In his speech in February Fox spoke of the need to resolve the Palestinian issue as way of undercutting Iran 's ability to cause trouble in the Middle East .
The 2009 conference was held just weeks after the end of Israel 's Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip , in which 1,400 Palestinians were killed ."
2011-10-16,"After a week in which the Liam Fox scandal has dominated the media it is not surprising that most of today 's papers have various angles about it on their front pages .
So let us start with an exclusive from the Independent on Sunday , which claims that Fox 's friend and unofficial adviser "" plotted with Mossad to target Iran "" .
Adam Werritty , goes the story , has been involved in an "" audacious plot "" to bring down the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and has visited Iran on several occasions .
He has also , according to the report , met Iranian opposition groups in Washington and London .
This allegation will form part of the O'Donnell inquiry .
The plot thickens .
Now to the ruck between Ryan Giggs and his sister - in - law , Natasha , which is dominating the front page of the Sunday Mirror .
Last week Giggs and his wife , Stacey , bumped into Natasha in the high street in Manchester .
During the first meeting since Natasha kissed and told all about the affair she alleges she had with the footballer , insults were thrown backwards and forwards , doubtless to the delight of passers - by .
Now Natasha has once again decided to speak out , with the story running over two pages inside , "" revealing "" that "" [ Giggs ] has this image of being nice , quiet , well - mannered and polite .
In reality he 's just vile and thinks he 's invincible . ""
The Sunday Times ( page two ) has a shocking story about elderly people going hungry in hospitals and care homes .

It found that some patients were dangerously underweight , with one resident found to be eating only two pieces of toast a day despite being prescribed a high calorie diet .
The director of the CQC is threatening legal action against one nursing home .
The story raises the uncomfortable truth yet again about our oft disgraceful attitude towards older and vulnerable people in the UK .
The Observer 's front page leads with an accusation that Cameron has allowed close links between members of his cabinet with US neocons .
Fox 's now defunct charity , Atlantic Bridge , had formed a partnership with the American Legislative Exchange Council , supposedly a lobbying organisation and funded by Charles G Koch , one of the largest donors to the Tea Party .
Koch has , according to Greenpeace , given substantial amounts of money to climate change deniers .
These allegations of cabinet members cosying up to virulent rightwingers , including Eurosceptics , are an embarrassment for a prime minister who wishes to portray himself as green and fair .
Over to the Sunday Telegraph and a front - page photograph of the Queen at Ascot .
The story inside is about Her Majesty backing plans to reform the primogeniture law requiring that male heirs supersede older sisters in the line to succession .
This would mean that if Kate and William 's first - born were female , she would one day be the monarch .
Apparently the Queen has "" let it be known "" that she approves of the change to Cameron , who is currently trying to get the consent of 15 Commonwealth countries to go ahead with the reform .
Back to the IoS , and just in case you are thinking that feminism has won the war , a story about short skirts catches my eye .
On reading this I thought I had fallen asleep and woken up in an episode of Life on Mars .
The headteacher at a secondary school in Kent is warning parents that girls could be "" putting themselves at risk "" by "" sending out the wrong message "" if their skirts are too short , and the girls may be "" forced to wear trousers "" .
I thought the days where the wearing of short skirts was blamed for sexual assault , as opposed to the actual perpetrators , were over .
Not so .
The deputy director of children 's charity Kidscape is the voice of reason in this story .
"" Records of attacks on women and girls over the years have not followed hemlines , up or down , "" he said .
Quite right ."
2011-11-01,"An Iranian delegation is expected to turn up in Istanbul over the next 24 hours for an international conference on Afghanistan despite the dramatic downturn in Turkish - Iranian relations of recent weeks .
The warm relationship between Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of a couple of years ago , which culminated in an ill - fated proposal over an uranium exchange last year , is now distinctly frosty .
The split is particularly apparent over Syria where the two countries ' interests are directly opposed .
Turkish officials tell me they are certain that Iranian revolutionary guards have played an active role in suppressing the Syrian unrest , while Turkey has decisively taken the side of the revolt , holding formal talks with the Syrian opposition and reportedly providing haven for the rebel Free Syrian Army .
Nonetheless , the Iranian press agency ISNA is reporting that the deputy foreign minister for Asia , Mohammad Ali Fathollahi , is on the way to Istanbul , and Turkish officials say he is still on the list of attendees .
That should make for some interesting body language with Hillary Clinton , who will also be at the meeting , but who will be anxious to avoid any joint photo opps in the wake of the Washington bomb plot .
More importantly , Iran is expected to try to sabotage any outcome in Istanbul that could further the US goal of stabilising Afghanistan prior to the withdrawal of combat troops by the end of 2014 .
Turkish officials also believe the Iranian delegation will do its utmost to block Ankara 's emergence as a centre of gravity for regional diplomacy .
In the run - up to the Istanbul conference , I am told , Iran asked to take part in today 's preliminary trilateral summit meeting between Turkey , Afghanistan and Pakistan , but that bid was rejected by Ankara .
As for tomorrow 's international conference , Turkish officials say that Tehran is focused exclusively on the complete and immediate withdrawal of foreign troops and has indicated it would not endorse any regional agreement on Afghanistan 's future if that undertaking is not forthcoming .
Consequently , the final statement tomorrow , if there is one , is likely to be so diluted it has no practical meaning .
That , in turn , is yet more bad news for the German organisers of the Bonn conference of Afghanistan on December 5 , which was supposed to benefit from the ' momentum ' generated in Istanbul .
The Turkish meeting is more likely to have the opposite effect .
Little wonder that expectations of political progress in Afghanistan are being ratcheting down with every passing day ."
2011-11-04,"The elections that gave Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a second term as president of Iran in 2009 caused so much turmoil that finding a way to prevent a repetition has become essential for the Islamic republic .
Two years from the next vote in 2013 – when Ahmadinejad would not be able to run for a third term according to the constitution – some Iranian politicians have come up with a rather radical solution : to abolish the presidency itself .
Initial thoughts on such a move came from a member of parliament , Hamidreza Katouzian , who was quoted by local news agencies as saying : "" A notion has been recently discussed among the country 's political commentators , that in a country blessed with the supreme leader , there is no need for a president . ""
Katouzian , a Tehran MP , even went as far as elaborating on the new political system : "" As for the head of the government , the country can have a prime minister appointed by the parliament .
"" Iran has not had a prime minister since 1989 , but scrapping the post of directly elected president and instead restoring that of prime minister – appointed by the parliament rather than directly elected – would kill two birds with one stone .
First , the regime would be able to avert any possible recurrence of the unrest that challenged the legitimacy of the Islamic republic following the disputed presidential election in 2009 .
The regime 's fear of such a repeat is exacerbated by the current atmosphere of the Arab countries .
Secondly , in the wake of a bitter top - level power struggle between the president and the supreme leader , Ali Khamenei , such a decision will give Khamenei and his supporters in parliament – who have an absolute majority – the chance to clip Ahmadinejad 's wings , and prevent him from influencing the choice of his successor .
Katouzian 's comments were not initially taken seriously .
They were viewed only as a warning in the latest spat between president and parliament – a relationship that has already been damaged by threats from MPs to impeach Ahmadinejad over his refusal to comply with parliamentary legislation .
But Katouzian 's comments were later echoed by several other politicians , until the supreme leader himself hinted that he had "" no problem "" with plans to scrap the post of president and introduce a new political system .
This appears to be a major setback for Ahmadinejad in his confrontation with Khamenei . ""
Presently , the country 's ruling political system is a presidential one in which the president is directly elected by the people , making this a good and effective method , "" Khamenei told a group of academics in the western province of Kermanshah . ""
However , if one day , probably in the distant future , it is deemed that the parliamentary system is more appropriate for the election of officials holding executive power , there would be no problem in altering the current structure , "" he added .
Khamenei 's comments took the debate to a national level .
Iranian media have since devoted significant space to discussing the consequences of such a move .
Supporters of Khamenei see it as an opportunity to get rid of Ahmadinejad – and therefore appear to be supporting it .
Opponents of the move consist of various groups , in which supporters of Ahmadinejad see it as an excuse to prevent the president 's allies taking power .
Others argue that eliminating the presidency would undermine or even destroy the republican element of the Islamic republic , according to its constitution .
Influential politicians such as Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , the former president and the current head of the expediency council , which has a mediatory role , have come forward to speak against the move – in defiance of what Khamenei suggested .
Since Ahmadinejad stepped into the presidential office for the first time in 2005 he has brought pain upon many people affected by his power – primarily human rights activists , women 's rights campaigners , journalists , student activists , dissidents , bloggers , trade unionists and lawyers .
But Ahmadinejad has bitten the hand that fed him too .
He has alienated many of his supporters in various bodies throughout the country , members of parliament and , most importantly , the supreme leader himself who had regarded the president as his protege until recently , when an extraordinary rift between them began to develop .
Regardless of the problems with the current incumbent , abolishing the presidency in Iran would be a blow against democracy , not because switching from a presidential to a prime ministerial system is necessarily a bad thing , but because Iranian leaders , instead of addressing the real questions they face , are simply trying to erase the questions ."

2011-11-17,"Revoking a smoking ban may seem an unlikely way to boost election turnouts .
But in Iran , authorities are hopeful that allowing the traditional hubble - bubble , or water pipes , back into tea houses could encourage reluctant voters to go to the polls .
The government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has signed into law a bill that removes tea houses from the list of places where smoking tobacco is prohibited , Iranian newspapers reported on Thursday .
The move comes only two weeks after Iran 's court of administrative justice , a judicial body independent of the government , banned the smoking of all sorts of tobacco in traditional restaurants and tea houses .
Iranians were allowed only to smoke certain types – perceived to be less dangerous – in the past .
Since Ahmadinejad first took the office in 2005 , water pipes have intermittently been banned from , then allowed , in tea houses .
In his early years in power , Ahmadinejad came under pressure from conservatives to curb water pipe smoking , which had become a popular pastime for the young people but was seen as culturally decadent by the regime , despite being an integral part of the Persian culture for centuries .
A smoking ban was eventually passed in October 2006 but was lifted later to allow certain kinds of tobacco .
In July this year , Hossein Sajedinia , the Tehran police chief , announced a new restriction , prohibiting women from entering tea houses and traditional restaurants where water pipes , known as ghalyan in Persian , were served .
The new reprieve , which appears to be only for men , has already met with criticism .
Etemaad , the reformist newspaper , quoted Hosseinali Shahriari , the head of the parliamentary committee on health and treatment , as saying that the government 's decision was against the law .
The swift repeal of a ban after just two weeks highlights the extent of a power struggle between the president and his supporters on one side , and the conservatives of the judiciary and the parliament on the other side , fighting with each other for the next parliamentary elections due in March 2012 and the presidential vote in 2013 .
Under Iranian law , Ahmadinejad is limited to two terms and can not run in 2013 , but conservatives close to the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , are worried that the president is trying to preserve his dwindling power by helping his allies win as many seats as possible in the next parliament or grooming one of his confidants as his successor .
In response , the conservatives have come up with a radical solution : scrapping the post of directly elected president and restoring that of prime minister appointed by the parliament .
But Mohammad Javad Larijani , a top aide to Khamenei , told Reuters on Wednesday that the idea is "" still at the level of contemplation "" and that Iran will have at least one more president ."
2011-11-21,"Judicial authorities in Iran have attempted to arrest a close ally of the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , in what is widely being viewed as the latest twist in the struggle for power at the top of the Iranian regime .
A group of officials raided the offices of the daily government newspaper Iran on Monday in order to arrest Ali Akbar Javanfekr , the president 's media adviser .
Javanfekr is also the head of the state news agency , Irna .
At the weekend , a court in Tehran had sentenced him to one year in jail and a three - year ban on working for the press after "" publishing materials contrary to Islamic norms "" .
According to the semi - official Mehr news agency , Javanfekr was handcuffed but his arrest was "" temporarily halted "" after government officials intervened .
Mehr did not specify who had stepped into the dispute , but some accounts attributed the intervention to Ahmadinejad .
Javanfekr was reportedly conducting a press conference when the judiciary officials tried to detain him .
The conservative website Tabnak said the newspaper 's staff gathered in his office and tried to prevent the president 's top media aide being led away in handcuffs .
The officials used teargas to disperse the staff and arrested about 30 of them . ""
The judicial authorities threw teargas and tried to force their way into the [ newspaper 's ] building , "" Javanfekr told Isna news agency following the incident . ""
They arrested some of our reporters and took them away and hit one of my colleagues with an electric baton .
"" My colleagues were traumatised , some of them were hurt …
I 'm a representative of the government and the president 's adviser …
If they had summoned me , I would have gone to them .
They did not need to do these kind of actions . ""
Ahmadinejad fell foul of conservatives with Iran after a series of public confrontations with the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has the ultimate power in Iran .
Since then , the president has lost a degree of influence in Iranian politics , particularly in the parliament and the judiciary which are both under influence of Khamenei .
In the wake of the power struggle , many of Ahmadinejad 's supporters have distanced themselves from him , but a handful , including Javanfekr , have stood firm .
Javanfekr was put on trial after the publication of a series of articles about the chador , a garment that Iranian women wear to cover them from head to toe .
In one article , Ahmadinejad 's former media adviser , Mehdi Kalhor , criticised the black colour of Iranian chadors , saying they did not originate from the Persian culture but were rather imported from the west .
Javanfekr also gave an interview to an Iranian reformist newspaper , Etemaad , on Saturday which led to its temporary closure for two months .
In the interview , he criticised opponents of the president and supported Ahmadinejad 's chief of staff , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , whom the conservatives have accused of revolutionary deviancy and corruption .
In response to one of Etemaad 's questions about the recent power struggle , Javanfekr said the president has come "" to serve the people "" and "" will stay till the end , till martyrdom "" .
He also criticised the judiciary for arresting Ahmadinejad 's allies in recent months and shed light on some of the unseen dimensions of Iran 's internal power struggle .
The parliamentary elections in March 2012 and presidential vote in 2013 have escalated the rift between Ahmadinejad and his supporters on one side and the conservatives close to Khamenei on the other side , fighting with each other for more influence over Iranian politics ."
2011-11-27,"Iran 's parliament has voted to expel the British ambassador in Tehran in retaliation against economic sanctions imposed by the west over the Islamic republic 's disputed nuclear programme .
Iranian MPs on Sunday passed a bill that in effect gave President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's government two weeks to expel the ambassador , Dominick Chilcott .
The bill , which also requires Iran 's economic and trade links with the UK to be reduced , has yet to be approved by the Guardian Council , the powerful body of clerics and lawyers that vets parliamentary activity .
If the bill comes into effect , diplomatic relations between Tehran and London will be downgraded from ambassadorial level to that of chargé d'affaires and Chilcott – who took up his post only a few weeks ago – will have to leave Tehran .
Iran 's embassy in London had been operating without an ambassador for several months .
The UK Foreign Office vowed to react "" robustly "" if Iran expels Chilcott . ""
The Iranian parliament 's vote to expel our ambassador is regrettable , "" a statement said .
"" This unwarranted move will do nothing to help the regime address their growing isolation or international concerns about their nuclear programme and human rights record .
If the Iranian government acts on this , we will respond robustly in consultation with our international partners . ""
Last week , the chancellor , George Osborne , announced fresh punitive measures targeting Iranian financial sectors , including the Central Bank of Iran ( CBI ) , in the wake of a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , which said the Islamic regime had been engaged in nuclear activities with military applications .
Iran denied the claims , saying the UN report had been fabricated .
Iran 's oil industry relies heavily on the CBI for most of its banking transactions .
Sanctioning the CBI would have drastic consequences for the country 's economy , but the largest buyers of Iran 's crude oil such as China , Japan and India are unlikely to follow Britain 's path .
Italy and Spain , which are the largest buyers of Iran 's oil in Europe , are also believed to be opposed to targeting the CBI .
In Sunday 's vote at the Iranian parliament , 179 MPs voted in favour of the motion , four opposed and 11 abstained , local agencies reported , which shows a significant number of MPs were absent from the 290-seat parliament .
The semi - official Fars news agency said the four who voted against the motion complained the bill was not tough enough and demanded a complete cut in diplomatic ties with the UK .
The parliamentary speaker , Ali Larijani , said the vote was "" the beginning of the road "" .
Mehdi Kuchakzadeh , a Tehran MP , suggested that Iranians might raid the British embassy , implying a possible recurrence of the 1979 US hostage crisis in Iran . ""
The British government should know that if they insist on their evil stances the Iranian people will punch them in the mouth , exactly as happened against America 's den of spies , before it was approved by officials , "" said Kuchakzadeh .
"" Den of spies "" was first used to describe the US embassy in Tehran in 1979 .
The US currently does not have an embassy in Iran .
"" We must lock the British embassy and ignore them until they come begging like the Americans , "" said another MP , Mahmoud Ahmadi Bighash , in quotes carried by Borna news agency .
Despite the vote , it is too early to say that the British ambassador will be expelled .
Some analysts have interpreted the vote as part of a power struggle between parliament and government and believe that Iran 's foreign ministry might choose to ignore the decision of the MPs , especially because the parliamentary term will end in March .
By voting to expel Chilcott , some observers believe MPs might be trying to please the establishment in order to secure their candidacy for another term , which needs to be approved the Guardian Council .
The parliament 's decision is seen by pro - Ahmadinejad supporters as an attempt to hamper the government 's efforts to reduce tensions with the international community .
Iran 's state - run Press TV reported that Ahmadinejad said that Iran was ready to hold talks with the five permanent members of the UN security council – Britain , France , China , Russia , the US – plus Germany , a group known as P5 + 1 ."
2011-12-12,"Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has become the latest leader to find himself on the receiving end of that popular Middle Eastern method of protest – the thrown shoe .
Like George W Bush before him , Ahmadinejad found himself staring down the sole of a gentleman 's shoe when someone believed to be a recently laid - off textile worker decided to demonstrate his anger during an official ceremony in the north of the country .
Ahmadinejad was speaking in Sari , the capital of the Mazandaran province , when the man local agencies identified only by his first name , Rashid , threw his shoes at the president .
It would appear they missed their goal .
According to the Middle Eastern culture , throwing shoes is considered to be one of the strongest ways to show contempt .
Iranian media reported that Rashid , around 45 , had been discharged from a textile company after a year of not being paid by his employers .
"" One of the participants of the ceremony managed to reach the seats in the front row and threw his shoes at the president while criticising unemployment in the country , "" said Tabnak , a conservative news website close to the former revolutionary guards commander , Mohsen Rezaei .
Local agencies said the shoes did not hit Ahmadinejad due to "" his prompt reaction "" but hit the poster behind him .
Pictures of the incident were not immediately released .
The shoe - thrower is reported to have been wrestled to the floor by people attending the ceremony who shouted slogans in support of Ahmadinejad .
It was not clear wether he was arrested afterwards .
In 2008 , Bush was target of an Iraqi journalist , Muntadhar al - Zaidi , who threw his shoes at him during a Baghdad press conference .
Bush too showed quick reflexes in dodging the missiles .
In 2010 shoes were also thrown at the president of Pakistan , Asif Ali Zardari , in a conference in Birmingham .
Iran 's English - language state - run newspaper , Tehran Times , in September quoted the head of the country 's statistics centre as putting the unemployment rate at 13.5 % in the previous year of the Persian calender ( ending 20 March 20 2011 ) .
Many independent economists have questioned official figures and have put the rate much higher ."
2012-01-06,"The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , is due to touch down in Venezuela on Sunday on the first leg of a Latin American tour aimed at lifting his regime out of international isolation and bolstering its sanctions - hit economy .
Ahmadinejad , who is facing growing economic discontent at home and pressure from the west over Iran 's disputed nuclear programme , will also visit Nicaragua , Cuba , Ecuador and possibly Guatemala in a search for new and improved economic partnerships to reduce the impact of sanctions .
The five - day Latin America visit is scheduled to start in the Venezuelan capital , Caracas , with meetings with president Hugo Chávez , a long - time ally .
Ahmadinejad is then expected to travel to Managua for the swearing - in of the Nicaraguan president , Daniel Ortega , before travelling to Cuba and Ecuador .
Reports suggest he may also visit Guatemala .
The president 's entourage is expected to include the energy minister , Majid Namjoo , who has said the tour is aimed at promoting commercial ties with Latin American countries .
Analysts view Ahmadinejad 's excursion as a reaction to growing economic difficulties at home and political isolation abroad .
Michael Shifter , president of the Washington - based thinktank Inter - American Dialogue , said Iran had economic and geopolitical agendas in Latin America .
"" Iran has real economic difficulties and is isolated , so the trip makes sense in that context , "" he said .
"" Latin America , in contrast , is in pretty good economic shape and is increasingly active in global , diplomatic affairs . ""
Maria Teresa Romero , professor of international studies at the Universidad Central de Venezuela , said the trip was also intended as a warning signal to Washington .
"" That Iran 's president has chosen to visit the region – and only the more staunch political opponents to the US – at a moment when tensions between the US and Iran are escalating is a challenge , a threat , from the Iranian government to the US that sends a clear message : ' We can go to your backyard when we want to , ' "" she said .
Iran is grappling with a range of domestic and international problems .
Its currency , the rial , has plunged to a record low in recent weeks , causing mayhem at the Iranian stock market and prompting fears over the future effects of the sanctions on the economy .
High unemployment , political power struggles and fears of unrest before the parliamentary elections in March have made the domestic political atmosphere increasingly tense .
At an international level , Iran has resorted to sabre - rattling and threatening countries involved in a campaign to bring sanctions against its central bank and impose a ban on the import of its oil .
Iran raised the stakes , warningthe west it might close the strait of Hormuz , a strategically important passageway in the Gulf through which one fifth of the world 's oil is transported , should greater sanctions on its oil be imposed .
Latin America has become an increasing priority for Ahmadinejad since his election in 2005 .
New embassies have opened in six countries , while state - run Press TV has also been beefing up its presence in the region , with correspondents in Caracas and more recently Sao Paulo .
On the eve of Ahmadinejad 's visit , one Press TV report said : "" The promotion of all - out co - operation with Latin American countries is among the top priorities of the Islamic republic 's foreign policy . ""
But Shifter said Iran 's president should not hope for big advances during his tour .
Ahmadinejad will not visit Brazil , the regional economic powerhouse , as he did during his previous visit in 2009 – an indication that relations have cooled since Dilma Rousseff took over as president .
"" Iran should probably keep its expectations in check .
If Iran 's goal is to extend its influence , Latin America does not offer a hospitable environment .
It is telling that the larger , more significant countries are not part of Ahmadinejad 's itinerary .
These countries may want greater independence from Washington , and may be flexing their muscles a bit on the global stage , but they are not keen to be aligned strategically with Tehran , "" he said .
Romero said that in the case of Hugo Chávez , who faces a tricky presidential election in October , the visit could even backfire .
"" This is an electoral year in both the US and Venezuela , and I would be surprised if the Republicans do n't use this kind of event to exert more pressure on the Obama administration .
I think sanctions against Iran are likely to strengthen , but I also think they could be extended to Venezuela . """

2012-01-11,"The arrival of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the Venezuelan capital Caracas on Sunday was an interesting but minor item in the process of what has become known as "" south - south relations "" .
It will strengthen western myth - makers – the same ones who brought us Saddam Hussein 's weapons of mass destruction – on the story of Venezuela as a modern day
Cave of the 40 Thieves with Hugo Chávez cast as the wicked and wily Ali Baba .
For many in Washington and Whitehall , the Venezuelan leader had already shown his wiliness when in 2002 , he bounced back from a dreadfully incompetent plot to overthrow him staged by a local businessman with the backing of the Bush government .
Now , the myth - makers demonstrate that the evil Chávez is allying himself with the power in the Middle East that is pressing on with nuclear experiments that the west has decided only Israel is allowed to undertake .
The myth - makers will be underlining that he is not only wily – by refusing to align himself with US interests in the west while fighting a clearly serious dose of cancer – but uppity as well .
The blighter has been using his oil company in the US to distribute cut - price fuel to poor people in New England and the midwest .
Is there nothing , they expostulate in the state department , to which this upstart will not stoop ?
Beyond the clouds of poisonous incense , there are very good reasons for the two men to get together once again .
Iran and Venezuela have justifiably common interests .
In Baghdad in 1960 , along with Iraq , Kuwait and Saudi Arabia , they joined forces to found the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( Opec ) to ensure themselves better terms from foreign oil companies .
Venezuela 's oil minister , Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo , whom I got to know well in Caracas , was certainly at least as prominent as anyone else in its foundation and early years .
The Opec ties between the two countries are certainly more justified than those between the US and , say , Afghanistan or Greece in Nato .
Iran and Venezuela are demonised by Washington – Chávez for his uppityness , the Iranians because they reacted diplomatically in the face of western support and arming of the Shah dictatorship and his torturers in the Savak secret police .
The west 's attitude in toppling Iran 's popular leader Mohammad Mosaddegh for his crime of nationalising the oil companies in 1953 and putting back the brutal and ludicrous Shah was of a piece with western support of Latin American dictators .
These ranged from General Marcos Pérez Jiménez – an ally of Washington who scuttled off with sack - loads of cash from Venezuela to Franco 's Spain in the 1950s when his country could stand him no longer –
General Augusto Pinochet ( friend of Margaret Thatcher ) , General Leopoldo Galtieri , General Alfredo Stroessner of Paraguay ( a favourite of Dwight D Eisenhower ) and the Somoza of Nicaragua .
That there is mild surprise in the west about the visit of an Iranian leader to Venezuela when both are facing challenges at home and abroad is unremarkable .
But then when were western audience and readerships ever given much chance in their media to learn about Latin America since the death of Che Guevara and Carmen Miranda ?

2012-02-07,"The Iranian parliament has summoned the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , to answer a series of questions over the government 's handling of the economy and his personal judgments .
The move is unprecedented in the history of the Islamic republic .
After a year of internal debate and unsuccessful attempts to question or impeach the president , MPs secured enough signatures for an attempt to summon Ahmadinejad .
They succeeded in persuading the parliament 's presiding board to read the motion during Tuesday 's open session .
The move comes at a time of discontent at home owing to western economic sanctions and growing international isolation over Iran 's nuclear programme .
In recent weeks , fears of a major confrontation between Iran and the west have grown .
Within a month of receiving the summons , Ahmadinejad is required by law to appear in the parliament .
Otherwise , MPs may impeach him .
However , such a decision does not follow automatically either from his failing to attend the session or from his failing to give answers that satisfy parliament .
Local news agencies quoted the deputy head of the Iranian parliament , Mohammad Reza Bahonar , as saying : "" Ahmadinejad will be immediately informed about the decision ...
He has to appear in parliament a month after being officially informed .
"" Earlier this month , representatives of Ahmadinejad had met with MPs in an attempt to address their concerns about the president .
But Mostafa Reza Hosseini , a spokesman for the MPs , told the semi - official Mehr news agency that they "" had not been convinced by the answers "" , resulting in their summoning the president , in a motion signed by 79 of Iran 's 290 MPs .
This is the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution that the parliament has summoned the president for questioning .
Abdulhassan Banisadr , Iran 's first post - revolutionary president , was impeached in June 1981 and exiled for allegedly attempting to undermine clerical power in the country .
Previous attempts by Iranian MPs to question Ahmadinejad failed owing to apparent intervention by the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Khamenei , who holds the ultimate power in Iran .
Khamenei , who adopted Ahmadinejad as his protege in the past , does not appear to have stepped in this time .
Iranian agencies have published a list of 10 questions the MPs expect Ahmadinejad to answer when he appears in parliament .
These include questions about the government 's controversial plan to reform subsidies , his refusal to comply with parliamentary legislation , and about a period of time last year when Ahmadinejad stayed away from the presidential palace for 11 days in an apparent protest at Khamenei 's reinstatement of a minister he had asked to step down .
Last year , Ahmadinejad 's unprecedented disobedience of Khamenei and his many public confrontations with the parliament prompted harsh criticism from conservatives .
Ahmadinejad 's summoning comes less than a month before the country 's parliamentary elections , in March .
The vote will be the first national ballot since the 2009 disputed presidential poll , when popular uprisings against the results challenged the legitimacy of the regime .
Iran 's intelligence minister , Heidar Moslehi , has described the March vote as "" the most sensitive "" elections in the history of the Islamic republic "" .
Speaking to the Guardian , a former adviser to an Iranian president , who asked not to be named , said : "" The summoning has come at the worst time for Ahmadinejad .
It is a shock for the campaign of those of his supporters who are running in the parliamentary elections .
At the time when he should be campaigning for his allies , he has to sit in the position of the wrongdoer and defend himself . ""
With few weeks before the elections , on 2 March , Tehran 's leaders are acting to avert any possible recurrence of the 2009 unrest as calls for a widespread boycott of the vote gather pace among the opposition ."
2012-02-11,"Iran will soon reveal "" very big new achievements "" in its controversial nuclear programme , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has announced .
Speaking at a rally in Tehran to mark the 33rd anniversary of the Islamic revolution , Ahmadinejad also said Iran would never give up its uranium enrichment progamme . ""
In the coming days the world will witness Iran 's announcement of its very important and very major nuclear achievements , "" Ahmadinejad told a crowd at Tehran 's Azadi [ Freedom ] Square broadcast on state television .
Tens of thousands of Iranians joined state - organised rallies across the country to mark the anniversary of the overthrow of Shah , who was largely reviled as a US puppet by his opponents .
The US and its allies suspect Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons , while Iran insists its programme has only peaceful purposes .
The Islamic republic has said it is forced to manufacture nuclear fuel rods , which provide fuel for reactors , on its own since international sanctions ban it from buying them on foreign markets .
Tensions over Iran 's nuclear ambitions have risen sharply in recent weeks amid expectations of a military strike by Israel .
Earlier this week , US president Barack Obama ordered the freezing of Iranian government assets , including transactions by the Iranian Central Bank , in tightened sanctions over Tehran 's nuclear programme ."
2012-02-13,"Iran has been accused of misleading the international community by claiming to have abandoned the death penalty for juvenile offenders and execution by stoning for those convicted of adultery .
Local news agencies reported at the weekend that Iran 's guardian council , a body of clerics and lawyers in charge of approving parliamentary activities , had approved a new amendment to the country 's penal code which had been passed into law by the MPs .
The new penal code – which will come into effect after being signed by the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad – is believed to have been adopted in response to international criticism of Iran 's violations of human rights .
But experts who have studied the new code questioned claims that the country had fully abolished the death penalty for those convicted under the age of 18 or abandoned its use of stoning .
They also believe the amendments have complicated some other parts of the law , especially the punishment of homosexuality .
Sodomy for men was punishable by death for all individuals involved in consensual sexual intercourse , but under the new amendments the person who played an active role will be flogged 100 times if the sex was consensual and he was not married , but the one who played a passive role will still be put to death regardless of his marriage status .
Under the new code , the death sentence has been removed for juveniles only in crimes whose punishment can be administered at the discretion of the judge ( such as drug offences ) .
Under the same law , however , a death sentence may still be applied for a juvenile if he or she has committed crimes that are considered to be "" claims of God "" and therefore have mandatory sentences ( such as sodomy , rape , theft , fornication , apostasy and consumption of alcohol for the third time ) .
A decision on whether such a death sentence for a juvenile can be issued relies on the "" judge 's knowledge "" – a loophole that allows for subjective judicial rulings where no conclusive evidence is present .
Amnesty International 's Iran researcher Drewery Dyke said : "" Let 's not be fooled by this seeming suggestion of improvements to Iran 's penal code .
The penal code still allows for stoning to be carried out .
Child offenders are still at risk of being placed on death row , and men and women can still be convicted on grounds of consensual extramarital and same - sex relations . ""
"" These new amends to Iran 's penal code have done nothing to improve the country 's human rights record .
Shadi Sadr , a prominent Iranian human rights lawyer exiled in London , said : "" The amendments are flawed but it shows international pressure on Iran still works . ""
Sadr 's colleague , Nasrin Sotoudeh , who highlighted juvenile executions in the Islamic republic , remains in jail in the country .
Confusion over Iran 's definition of a juvenile has also added to the complexity of the issue , said Raha Bahreini , a fellow at Amnesty International Canada .
The country does not provide a clear distinction between the age of majority – when minors cease to legally be considered children – and the minimum age of criminal responsibility , which is 15 for boys and nine for girls under Iranian law .
"" Iran 's penal system has often taken the minimum age of criminal responsibility for the age of majority , "" she said , "" thus allowing individuals under the age of 18 to be treated and sentenced as adults as soon they reach the minimum age of criminal responsibility . ""
According to the old penal code , people convicted of having an "" illicit relationship outside marriage "" would be sentenced to death by stoning .
The new code , however , still considers "" adultery while married "" as a crime but has not designated any punishment for it , thus referring the judge to the fatwa of a reliable cleric ( the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , in this case ) for a decision .
Khamenei has not yet issued a fatwa for such a crime , but all other clerics in the country order stoning as its punishment .
It would be highly unlikely that Khamenei would contradict his fellow clerics .
"" It 's simply a trick , "" said Sadr .
"" They 've removed death by stoning from the penal code but in reality it remains in place . ""
The new penal code does not mention stoning as punishment for any crime but it does refer to it twice in a section about the criminal procedure rules and conditions under which such a punishment can be administered .
"" The fact that stoning has been mentioned in the criminal procedures of administrating the punishment – it shows they are truly expecting the method to be used in future , "" said Sadr , adding there were other discrepancies in the code .
In recent years , Iran has been criticised by human rights organisations for its escalating use of the capital punishment .
Recently , an international outcry over the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani , a 44-year - old mother of two , highlighted the plight of at least a dozen Iranians behind bars who are awaiting death by stoning ."
2012-02-15,"Iran has stepped up its defiance against the west over Tehran 's nuclear programme , claiming to have built faster uranium enrichment centrifuges and have loaded domestically made fuel plates into a reactor .
The move comes amid an escalation of the rhetoric between Iran and Israel over allegations made by officials in the two countries about bomb attacks in Tehran and other capitals including Delhi and Tbilisi as well as Tuesday 's blasts in Bangkok .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad unveiled on Wednesday what he described as a "" very big new achievement "" in Iran 's disputed nuclear programme in a ceremony at Tehran 's research reactor , the semi - official Fars news agency reported .
Nuclear fuel rods that Iran says have been manufactured domestically and enriched to 20 % are reported to have been inserted into Tehran 's reactor , Fars said .
Other people present at the ceremony included the foreign minister , Ali Akbar Salehi , Iran 's nuclear chief , Fereydoun Abbasi Davani , and the son of an Iranian nuclear scientist , Majid Shahriari , who was assassinated in Tehran in November 2010 in what is widely being seen as a campaign against the regime 's nuclear activities .
The Tehran water research reactor , which is under the surveillance of the UN nuclear agency inspectors , produces radioisotopes for use in medical treatments and agriculture .
State television also announced development of a new generation of centrifuges for use in uranium enrichment facilities that it claimed were faster and produce less waste .
"" The fourth generation of domestically made centrifuges have a higher speed and production capacity , "" it said .
Iran 's students ' news agency , Isna , reported that Ahmadinejad unveiled the "" advanced "" centrifuges in a video conference with the Natanz uranium enrichment site which , according to Fars , will now be named after Mostafa Ahmadi - Roshan , one of the Iranian nuclear scientists assassinated in recent years ( the Fordow nuclear site , which is under a mountain near the holy city of Qom , is to now be named after Masoud Ali - Mohammadi ) .
In a live television broadcast , Ahmadinejad said : "" The era of bullying nations has passed .
The arrogant powers can not monopolise nuclear technology .
They tried to prevent us by issuing sanctions and resolutions but failed ... our nuclear path will continue . ""
According to Iranian claims , the "" fourth generation "" centrifuge would be able to enrich uranium three times faster than the previous capability .
Iran 's English - language television station , Press TV , said Tehran added 3,000 new centrifuges to its Natanz enrichment facility , increasing the total number of Iran 's active centrifuges to 9,000 .
Experts , however , have questioned Iran 's ability to make such sophisticated machines in industrial quantity .
Sergei Ryabkov , the Russian deputy foreign minister , told a news agency that Moscow was concerned about Iran 's nuclear progress but urged the west to resume negotiations with Tehran .
Talks came to a standstill last year after several unsuccessful attempts to reach agreement on an agenda .
He called on the west to "" search for compromises and the proposal of a solution scheme that could interest the Iranian side . ""
He said western sanctions against the regime had "" zero "" effect on forcing Iran to comply with its international obligations .
Speaking to the journal Security Index , Ryabkov said : "" We have no smoking gun confirming the presence of a military component and a military aspect of the Iranian nuclear programme . ""
France and Britain added their concerns to Wednesday 's reported nuclear progress in Iran . ""
These statements are an extra concern for the international community , "" said French deputy foreign ministry spokesman Romain Nadal .
"" The Iranian military nuclear programme constitutes one of the most serious threats to peace not only in the world but in the region .
We are convinced that Iran continues to develop this programme .
[ These ] announcements reinforce that conviction . ""
A Foreign Office spokesman said : "" [ This ] does not give any confidence that Iran is ready to engage meaningfully on the international community 's well - founded concerns about its nuclear programme .
Until it does so , we 'll only increase peaceful and legitimate pressure on Iran to return to negotiations . ""
Iranian news agencies reported on Sunday that a senior diplomat from China 's foreign ministry , Ma Zhaoxu , was in Tehran to discuss Iran 's nuclear programme .
Despite raising the stakes with the west by announcing new advances , Iran 's state - run Arabic - language television , al - Alam , said a letter from Tehran had been sent to the EU foreign policy chief , Catherine Ashton , expressing readiness for fresh nuclear talks with the world 's major powers , including the US , France , Germany , China , Russia and Britain , the group known as P5 + 1 .
In recent years , Iran 's nuclear programme has experienced a series of dramatic setbacks : Stuxnet , a computer worm believed to have been designed by the opponents of the regime , caused damage to its nuclear programme and four of Iran 's nuclear scientists have been assassinated in the past two years .
Another scientist , who was wounded in an assassination attempt , was later promoted to become the country 's nuclear chief .
The Iranian authorities say the nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes but many western governments believe it has military applications .
Tensions have escalated since a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency in November led to an oil embargo against Iran by the US and its European allies .
In response to western sanctions which have recently begun to bite , Iran has resorted to sabre - rattling and threats of closing the strait of Hormuz .
In recent weeks , fears of a major confrontation between Iran and Israel have grown .
Meanwhile , Iran warned that it could cut off oil exports to six European countries in retaliation for the latest sanctions imposed on the regime .
The announcement caused turmoil in the world 's crude market ."
2012-02-16,"Iranian censors have blocked access to a number of news websites sympathetic to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , adding further fuel to a high - level power struggle at the heart of the Islamic regime .
Authorities in charge of online censorship in Iran , who are believed to be close to the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and his powerful Revolutionary Guards , have in the past few days filtered a series of websites and blogs which were operating in support of Ahmadinejad and his allies .
The move comes ahead of parliamentary elections in March , described as the most sensitive in the history of the Islamic republic .
Digarban , an opposition website which monitors the activities of conservatives inside the regime , has identified a list of pro - Ahmadinejad websites blocked recently , including mahramane.com and www.rahapress.com .
Last year , it emerged that a rift had developed between Khamenei and his supporters on one side and Ahmadinejad and his allies on the other , each fighting for greater share of power over Iranian politics .
Opponents of Ahmadinejad accused him and his close confidant and chief of staff , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , of attempting to undermine the clerical power and supremacy of Khamenei by advocating nationalistic causes in order to appeal to a larger number of Iranians .
Dozens of Ahmadinejad 's allies have been arrested in recent months and media adviser Ali Akbar Javanfekr , one of his top aides , this week lost an appeal against a six - month jail term .
But Iran 's parliamentary elections , scheduled for 2 March , are seen as an opportunity for Ahmadinejad to fight back .
The current parliament , which is dominated by Khamenei 's people , has been critical of Ahmadinejad and has repeatedly threatened him with impeachment .
In an unprecedented move , the parliament last week summoned Ahmadinejad to answer a series of questions over the government 's handling of the economy and his personal judgments .
Ahmadinejad has one month to appear before the parliament .
Iran 's opposition and reformists have largely boycotted the coming poll , which will be the country 's first elections since 2009 , leaving it open for Ahmadinejad 's team to oppose pro - Khamenei conservatives .
The Guardian Council , which vets all candidates before any election , has not yet announced the final list of those allowed to run but many analysts believe Ahmadinejad 's allies are likely to hide their allegiances in order to avoid being barred .
The council has delayed its announcement of the final list of approved candidates in an apparent move to allow little time for opponents to voice discontent .
The March vote , described by Iran 's intelligence minister , Heidar Moslehi , as "" the most sensitive "" in the history of the Islamic republic , comes at a time when the regime is facing economic discontent at home and increasing international isolation because of western sanctions imposed after a dispute over the country 's controversial nuclear activities .
The rhetoric between Iran and Israel has escalated over allegations about bomb attacks in capitals including Delhi , Tbilisi and Bangkok .
Many analysts doubt that Tehran 's foreign policy is controlled by Ahmadinejad 's government and attribute it to Khamenei and his elite Revolutionary Guards .
Iran launched a fresh clampdown on web users last month , with draconian rules on cybercafes .
In the past week , Iran has reacted to calls for fresh street protests over the house arrest of opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi by reducing internet speeds significantly and temporarily blocking access to emails ."
2012-03-02,"Iranians are voting today to elect a parliament , and both the country 's leaders and the world media are obsessed with turnout .
Iran 's top clerics , for their part , are desperate to report a vigorous vote to project an image of strength and stability as their showdown with the west fast approaches .
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , whose supporters are involved in a face off with allies of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for control of parliament , called on Iranians to turnout and "" smack the face "" of the nation 's enemies .
For days , the state media has broadcast a steady beat of nationalistic encouragement , suggesting to Iranians that not voting is akin to laying down a red carpet for foreign invasion .
Even in the poll 's early hours , state - run news websites were running breathless headlines about stations running out of ballot papers .
The world 's attention is similarly fixed on whether Iranians can be coaxed out to vote .
Analysts and news stories note that reasonable turnout will boost the regime 's confidence , showing it to be – despite the increasing toll of sanctions – still adept at marshalling supporters and shaping public opinion .
The regime has successfully convinced Iranians to blame the United States and Israel for sanctions , the thinking goes , and decent voter participation may underscore just how much goodwill the west has lost in Iran .
But this preoccupation with turnout is wrong - minded .
To start with , the authorities ' tight restrictions on reporting are preventing journalists from openly gauging the scale of participation .
Journalists are being bussed into selected polling stations .
Stories written by resident correspondents are worded so cautiously as to be virtually meaningless .
Of course the regime 's staunch supporters will turn out and regale reporters with why it 's their duty to vote , and people in the provinces will honestly admit to voting to ensure further state handouts .
But what about the silent near - majority – the millions and millions of apathetic middle class , urban voters ?
The reality is that we have no real reported sense of what is transpiring in Iran today .
That leaves us with the government 's numbers .
Back when the regime 's threshold for vote manipulation was not quite so high , the world took its turnout numbers at face value .
When Iranians turned out in astonishing numbers to elect the reformist Mohammad Khatami in 1997 and again in 2001 ( turnout for his first victory was nearly 90 % ) , their participation was taken as fact even in the halls of the US state department .
The figures were remarkable , and Iran soon came to be regarded as a fledgling experiment in Islamic democracy .
None of that plausibility applies to Iran today .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's contested 2009 election – when allegations of vote rigging led millions of Iranians into the street to demand "" Where is my vote ?
"" – has forever tainted confidence in Iran 's electoral process .
Regardless of whether the interior ministry , which runs the elections , announces turnout to be 60 or even 70 % , will those figures reflect anything true or illuminating about Iran ?
Iranian politicians used to mock Hosni Mubarak , Egypt 's former president , for his farcical 99.9 % victories .
But today they are becoming the smoke and mirrors leaders of the Middle East , forever staging productions before a weary people .
We would all like to gauge where Iran is headed , and make better sense of what Iranians think .
Do they blame their government for their deteriorating quality of life , or do they resent the west for the sanctions it is inflicting ?
Do they feel besieged as Iranians , or believe there is anything their leaders can do to steer the nation away from conflict ?
As Iran 's confrontation with the world grows more protracted and grave by the day , it is tempting to look to numbers and election results as a barometer of something .
But it would be a mistake to read anything into whatever turnout figures
Tehran releases today .
They will offer us , at best , a shaded and partial truth .

2012-03-03,"Conservative rivals of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad are leading in the race for Iranian parliament seats , according to early election results .
In a huge embarrassment , Parvin Ahmadinejad , a younger sister of the president , was defeated by a conservative rival in their hometown of Garmsar .
The conservatives ' lead was expected as the elections boiled down to a contest between conservatives supporting and opposing Ahmadinejad .
Early returns on Saturday in the capital , Tehran , showed loyalists to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , were pulling ahead .
Partial results from provincial towns showed conservative Ahmadinejad rivals elected in many constituencies .
The results indicate Ahmadinejad may face a more hostile parliament in the nearly two years remaining of his second term in office .
The authorities in Tehran attempted to portray a country united amid threats of war and western economic sanctions as Iranians went to the polls on Friday for the first time since the bitterly contested elections of 2009 .
Iran 's state television broadcast rolling coverage of the parliamentary elections , which began at 8 am local time , showing hundreds of people queuing up in polling stations across the country to cast their ballots in what has been described as the most sensitive vote in the history of the Islamic republic .
Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , whose authority as the man with the ultimate power in the country was challenged by the protests that followed the allegedly rigged results in 2009 , was one of the first people to vote before television cameras .
"" Whenever there has been more enmity towards Iran the importance of the elections has been greater , "" he said .
"" The arrogant powers are bullying us to maintain their prestige .
A high turnout will be better for our nation … and for preserving security . ""
The ayatollah described voting as a religious "" responsibility "" like that of Namaz , the Muslim practice of prayer five times a day .
With political discontent at home and international pressure making the regime vulnerable , turnout will be a litmus test for the legitimacy of its leaders .
Iran 's opposition , crushed in recent years and banned from running in the elections , largely called for a countrywide boycott of the vote .
Many activists sympathetic to the Green movement took to social networking websites to urge Iranians to embarrass the regime by staying at home .
Some distributed leaflets reading "" I wo n't vote "" .
For the opposition it was a non - event , although some Iranian politicians affiliated to the opposition , including former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , participated .
Some believe they were forced to . ""
In the past few decades I have always participated in elections held in this country despite my hatred for the regime , because I always believed in reform , "" a member of the Iranian opposition told the Guardian from Tehran , asking not to be named for fear of reprisal . ""
But after the events in 2009 I finally gave up and sat at home this time . ""
Human Rights Watch , a New - York based organisation that has closely monitored the situation of activists and campaigners in Iran , issued a statement on Thursday , warning that a fair vote was impossible in the country .
"" Iran 's parliamentary elections … will be grossly unfair , "" HRW said .
"" [ It ] follows the disqualification of hundreds of candidates based on vague and ill - defined criteria , and opposition leaders are either barred from participating , serving unjust prison sentences , or refusing to participate in what they consider sham elections .
"" The opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi were placed under house arrest in February 2011 .
Despite the boycott , reports from Iran suggested many people , especially those in small and conservative cities , participated in the vote .
Since 2010 the Iranian government has run a scheme of direct monthly payments to families in compensation for a cut in subsidies .
Although the money ( almost $ 37 ) does not catch the eyes of middle - class Iranians , it has been popular with poorer families who are believed to have voted in relatively large numbers .
"" It was a quiet day in Tehran , even from the state television 's broadcast you could see that only old people were voting , "" said Hamed , a Tehran resident . ""
However , I think people in small cities who have little access to information and are pleased with the government 's payments would vote , although I think the turnout would be less than 30 % .
"" Iran 's interior minister , Mostafa Mohammad - Najjar , was quick to predict a high turnout and Tehran 's governor , Morteza Tamadon , said there was a record vote in the capital .
In the runup to the elections Ayatollah Makarem Shirazi , an influential cleric , issued a religious ruling that to not vote would be a sin .
The wife of an assassinated nuclear scientist also urged people to vote .
Iran 's leaders warned that they would consider any attempt to encourage an electoral boycott as a crime .
In the absence of the opposition , Friday 's parliamentary vote was a battlefield for factions within the establishment , fighting each other for a greater share of power .
It could also be decisive for the future of a power struggle between supporters of the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , on one side and conservatives close to Khamenei on the other .
Some observers believe that the results will only consolidate Khamenei 's power more than ever in the parliament , making an already lame - duck president more isolated .
Ahmadinejad 's term ends in 2013 .
Foreign media were largely not allowed into Iran to cover the elections and those in the country could not operate freely .
"" This is the 1st election I 've covered anywhere in the world where authorities ordered reporters on buses to cover vote , "" Ivan Watson of CNN tweeted .
"" Visiting foreign journalists covering the election in Tehran have all been sent back to their hotels and told to stay put , "" tweeted another journalist , Jason Rezaian .
More than 48 million Iranians are eligible to vote in the Majlis elections ."
2012-03-03,"Conservative rivals of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appear on course to gain firm control of the Iranian parliament , according to early election results .
In a huge embarrassment to the president , his younger sister Parvin Ahmadinejad was defeated by a conservative rival in their hometown of Garmsar .
Of 197 winners declared by midday Saturday , at least 102 were conservatives who turned against Ahmadinejad after he openly challenged the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Among the prominent anti - Ahmadinejad victors were Gholam Ali Haddad Adel , whose daughter is married to Khamenei 's son , and parliament speaker Ali Larijani , Iran 's former nuclear negotiator .
Six independent candidates opposed to the president have also been elected so far .
The remaining seats were split between Ahmadinejad supporters and centrists .
At least 15 races will have to be decided in runoffs .
The results indicate Ahmadinejad may face a more hostile parliament in his final 18 months in office and give the ruling clerics a clear path to ensure his successor is a Khamenei loyalist .
The conservatives ' lead was expected as the elections boiled down to a contest between conservatives supporting and opposing Ahmadinejad .
Reformists were virtually absent from the ballot , showing the crushing force of crackdowns on the opposition .
Instead , Friday 's elections became a referendum on Ahmadinejad 's political stature after he tried to challenge the near - total authority of Khamenei to decide critical government policies such as intelligence and foreign affairs .
The apparent setbacks for Ahmadinejad 's backers , according to early results , could signal a decisive blow in the internal political conflicts and give hard - liners an even stronger say over Iran 's nuclear programme .
"" It appears that the era of ' Ahmadinejadism ' in Iran 's political history is gradually coming to an end , "" said Davoud Hermidas Bavand , a Tehran - based political analyst .
Khamenei said on Friday that Iran was moving into a "" sensitive period "" in the confrontation over Tehran 's nuclear programme , which Iran claims is peaceful but the US and its allies fear could lead to atomic weapons .
The US president , Barack Obama , is scheduled to hold talks on Monday at the White House with Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu , who is seeking US backing for a possible military action against Iran , but has signalled that Israel is ready to go alone .
In advance of the meeting , Obama stepped up his warnings that it was "" unacceptable "" for Iran to become a nuclear - armed state .
Yet even before all the final election result , which is expected at the earliest on Sunday , some Iranian officials were calling for a tougher response to the growing international pressure on the Islamic regime .
"" Under the present cold war we are in , this election will increase our national security .
It will make the US and the west change its tone toward us , "" said Muhammad Reza Bahanor , a hardliner seeking re - election .
He predicted that 80 % of the new parliament will belong to a group known as the ultraconservative Motahed , or United Front , which is the main anti - Ahmadinejad group .
Iran 's opposition , crushed in recent years and banned from running in the elections , largely called for a countrywide boycott of the vote .
The opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi were placed under house arrest in February 2011 .
Despite the boycott , reports from Iran suggested many people , especially those in small and conservative cities , participated in the vote .
More than 48 m Iranians are eligible to vote in the Majlis elections ."
2012-03-14,"It was the day opponents of Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , had long been waiting for - to see him called to account before the parliament .
But for those who are familiar with Ahmadinejad 's many tactics of evading questions , it came as no surprise that the president did not take the session seriously and adopted a sarcastic tone .
In an unprecedented move , the parliament last month summoned Ahmadinejad to answer a series of questions about the government 's handling of the economy and his personal judgments .
No Iranian president in the history of the Islamic republic has ever been summoned to parliament for questioning , though Abdulhassan Banisadr , Iran 's first post - revolutionary president , was impeached in June 1981 and exiled for allegedly attempting to undermine clerical power in the country .
In this case , the questioning will not automatically lead to his impeachment but it could prepare the ground for such a decision .
Ahmadinejad attempted to answer a list of 10 questions provided to him beforehand , which included queries about the government 's controversial plan to reform subsidies , and his refusal to comply with parliamentary legislation .
But among the most controversial issues , Ahmadinejad was asked to give explanation about a period last year when he stayed away from the presidential palace for 11 days in apparent protest at the supreme leader Ali Khamenei 's reinstatement of a minister he had asked to step down .
Speaking at the parliament , he said : "" This is one of those things .
Ahmadinejad staying home and resting .
Some of my friends have repeatedly told me to rest .
In this government , work has never stopped - even for a day . ""
Since his alleged walkout from the presidential office , a rift has developed between the president and Khamenei .
Supporters of the supreme leader publicly accused Ahmadinejad and his close confident and chief of staff , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , of being connected to a "" deviant current "" aimed at undermining Islamic values as well as the authority of Khamenei .
At the end of the session , Ahmadinejad appeared satisfied with his own answers .
"" It was not a very difficult quiz , "" he joked . ""
To me , those who designed the questions were from among those who got a master 's degree by just pushing a button .
If you had consulted us , better questions could have been drawn up , "" he said , adding he expected to be given a top score in the parliament 's "" quiz "" .
Ahmadinejad 's comments - his closing statements in particular - sparked uproar among MPs , who accused him of being impolite to parliament . ""
Here is not a place to share jokes .
This is the parliament .
The president has no right to insult the legislature , "" said an angry Iranian MP , Mohammad Reza Khabbaz .
Another MP , Mostafa Reza Hossein , said : "" The president 's language was insulting during his entire speech .
He escaped answering the questions .
As predicted , we did n't receive any logical answer from the president . ""
The semi - official Mehr news agency reported after the session that the MPs were not convinced by the president 's answers and were due to issue a statement .
Today 's questioning was the result of a year - long internal debate and unsuccessful attempts to question or impeach the president , only coming when MPs finally secured enough signatures to summon him .
There were unconfirmed reports of of a clash between supporters and opponents of Ahmadinejad as he spoke .
In a separate incident today , Khamenei reinstated a prominent cleric , Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , as the head of Iran 's expediency council , which mediates between the parliament and the Guardian Council .
The Guardian Council is in charge of vetting all candidates before any elections and also approving parliamentary legislations .
Hashemi Rafsanjani who has enjoyed significant influence over Iranian politics in the past , has seen his power diminish in recent years because of his support for the opposition and a series of spats with supporters of both Ahmadinejad and Khamenei ."
2012-03-28,"Turkish prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , is in Tehran for talks on the regime 's nuclear programme and the Syrian crisis .
Erdogan will hold meetings with senior Iranian officials including the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and the parliamentary speaker , Ali Larijani , during his two - day visit to the Iranian capital , local agencies report .
Welcoming Erdogan , Iran 's foreign minister , Ali Akbar Salehi , said fresh nuclear talks with the world 's major powers , including the US , France , Germany , China , Russia and Britain - the group known as P5 + 1 - were expected to be held on 13 April . ""
Istanbul has expressed its readiness to host these talks and is still one of the probable options for hosting these negotiations , "" Salehi said in quotes carried by the website of the state English - language television , Press TV .
"" I personally believe that Istanbul is the better option for hosting the negotiations , "" he said , adding that the EU foreign policy chief , Catherine Ashton , had also sought assistance from Turkey in choosing a venue for the talks .
"" We hope the venue for the talks will be determined within the next few days . ""
Before his Tehran visit , Erdogan was in South Korea , where he took part in a nuclear security summit and held talks with US president , Barack Obama .
There have been unconfirmed reports that Erdogan is carrying a message to Iran from Obama .
At the same time , Saledi said Kofi Annan , the former UN secretary general and UN / Arab League envoy , was expected to visit Tehran next week to discuss Syria with Iranian officials , the Irna state news agency reported .
Though they are close allies , Turkey and Iran hold opposite views on Syria .
Iran has sided with the Bashar al - Assad regime , backing him publicly on international platforms ; Turkey has played host to the Syrian opposition and its refugees , as well as voicing strong criticism of Assad 's handling of the crisis .
The Turkish English - language newspaper Today 's Zaman , quoted unnamed officials as saying : "" Erdogan is expected to press Tehran to accept that regime change is inevitable in Syria and to reverse its steadfast support of President Bashar al - Assad . ""
According to Today 's Zaman , Erdogan will also express concerns over reports of an Iranian transfer of weapons to Syria via Iraqi air space . ""
Iraqi authorities have not been fully able to control the country 's air space in the aftermath of the US withdrawal .
For Ankara , it is unacceptable that Iran sees this as an opportunity to transfer weapons to the Syrian regime , "" the newspaper reported .
Iran has repeatedly denied allegations it has supported the Assad regime militarily .

2012-03-29,"The Turkish prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , has met Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Tehran ahead of fresh nuclear talks between Iran and world 's major powers .
The meeting with the Iranian president was held behind closed doors , but the regime 's nuclear programme and the Syrian crisis are believed to be among the issues discussed between the two leaders .
During a two - day visit to the Iranian capital , Erdogan also met with other senior officials , including the vice president , Mohammad Reza Rahimi , and the parliamentary speaker , Ali Larijani .
Iranian media reported that Erdogan spoke against pressure on countries with peaceful nuclear activities in a joint press conference with Rahimi .
"" Nobody has the right to oppose peaceful nuclear activities , and Turkey is against any pressure over peaceful nuclear activities , "" Iran 's English - language newspaper , Tehran Times , quoted Erdogan as saying .
"" Any wise person is against nuclear weapons and approves of the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes . ""
Iran 's foreign minister , Ali Akbar Salehi , announced on Wednesday that fresh nuclear talks with the world 's major powers , including the US , France , Germany , China , Russia and Britain - the group known as P5 + 1 - were expected to be held on 13 April , although a venue for the negotiations has not yet been designated .
"" We had made a proposal to hold the nuclear meeting in Istanbul .
The Iranian foreign minister had expressed a desire to hold the nuclear negotiations in Istanbul .
We are waiting for the decision of the P5 + 1 , "" Erdogan said in quotes carried by the Turkish newspaper , Hurriyet Daily News .
Before his Tehran visit , Erdogan was in South Korea , where he took part in a nuclear security summit and held talks with US president , Barack Obama .
That has led to speculations that the Turkish leader is playing a mediatory role between Tehran and the west over the regime 's nuclear standoff .
The Turkish newspaper Zamanreported on Thursday the venue for the future talks is still unclear and that the P5 + 1 is more willing to hold the negotiations in a European capital than in Turkey .
Iran and Turkey are close allies in the Middle East but hold opposite views on Syria .
Little is known about Erdogan 's negotiations with Iranian officials about the Syrian crisis , but Turkish media reports saidt he was due to press Iran on its support for the Assad regime .
Many analysts , however , are sceptical about the outcome of the Turkish leader 's negotiations with Iran over Syria .
Writing in the Hurriyet Daily News , Turkish journalist Mehmet Ali Birand said a change in Iran 's stance on Syria was impossible .
In the mid or long term , the fall of al - Assad would cause Iran to lose its influence in the region to a great extent .
It would also lose its influence in Lebanon and it would be impossible for the ' Shiite corridor ' , which it is trying to form through alliances with Syria and Iraq , to access to the Mediterranean Saledi had announced yesterday that the UN / Arab League peace envoy , Kofi Annan , was scheduled to visit Tehran for talks on Syria next week but a spokesman for the former UN secretary general has denied the remarks made by the Iranian foreign minister .

2012-04-19,"When Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took office in 2005 , he pledged to visit all 31 Iranian provinces at least twice during his presidential term .
The plan drew criticism from the beginning ; the opposition accused him of populism by trying to promote his own profile , and said he was wasting money and time .
But many people loved it .
Pictures of thousands of people in provinces waiting for the presidential motorcade , desperately running after his car to catch a glimpse or shake a hand and , as it became popular later , to hand him a letter of request , became familiar in state TV 's rolling coverage of his visits .
When it became apparent that Ahmadinejad 's office actually responded to many of the letters – often requests for grants or loans – more and more people turned out to greet him .
Agency pictures showed a hardworking Ahmadinejad taking a nap on the floor on tour and a documentary was even made called Letters to the President .
But as his popularity dwindled , especially in the aftermath of the 2009 disputed presidential elections , his provincial visits became less triumphant : pictures ( such as this image from the western city of Tabriz ) showed humiliatingly small crowds turning out to greet him .
This week , a dramatic video was posted on YouTube showing a young woman jumping on to Ahmadinejad 's car .
The footage drew a great deal of attention , with the Times describing the woman as a "" motorcade heroine "" .
Elsewhere , the Telegraph said Ahmadinejad had been mobbed by "" hungry protesters "" .
Watching the video , it 's impossible to make out what the woman is actually saying to the president , but there is nothing to suggest the incident was any different from previous occasions in which petitioners have mobbed Ahmadinejad .
A similar incident happened earlier this year in Hormozgan province , in which another woman sat on his car .
A longer film of the incident shows an elderly man repeatedly shouting , "" Ahmadinejad , I 'm hungry , "" to the dismay of the presidential bodyguards .
Ahmadinejad 's visit to southern Iran triggered another controversy last week when he visited the disputed island of Abu - Musa , which the United Arab Emirates claims is Arab territory occupied by Iran .
The UAE officials ' criticism of the visit were echoed by other Persian Gulf states ."
2012-04-29,"Time for a quiz question .
Last week , who said Binyamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak –
Israel 's prime minister and defence minister – "" are misleading the public on the Iran issue "" and making decisions "" based on messianic feelings "" ?
Was it ( a ) Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ;
( b ) the Stop the War Coalition president , Tony Benn ; or
( c ) the former Israeli spymaster Yuval Diskin ?
It was ( c ) .
At a public meeting on Friday Diskin , former head of Shin Bet ( Israel 's MI5 ) , described Netanyahu and Barak as "" not fit to hold the steering wheel of power "" .
He went on : "" I have observed them from up close …
They are not people who I , on a personal level , trust to lead Israel to an event on that scale and carry it off …
They tell the public that if Israel acts , Iran wo n't have a nuclear bomb .
This is misleading .
Actually , many experts say that an Israeli attack would accelerate the Iranian nuclear race . ""
Diskin joins a long list of eminent members of the Israeli security establishment who have publicly voiced criticism of , and opposition to , their government 's ultra - hawkish line on Iran .
In fact , his astonishing attack on his former bosses came just 48 hours after the head of Israel 's military , Lieutenant General Benny Gantz , declared that the Iranian leadership had not yet made a decision to build nuclear weapons , that it was unlikely to go this "" extra mile "" , and was composed of "" very rational people "" .
"" Decisions must be made carefully out of historic responsibility but without hysteria , "" added Gantz in a not - too - subtle dig at his political masters .
Last month , in an unprecedented move , Meir Dagan , the former head of the Mossad – Israel 's foreign intelligence service – took to the airwaves in the US , using an interview with CBS to tell his American audience how a war with Iran would be "" devastating "" for Israelis because it would "" ignite , at least from my point of view , a regional war "" .
( He had earlier described an Israeli attack on Iran as "" the stupidest idea I 've ever heard "" . )
Meanwhile , Dagan 's predecessor , Efraim Halevy , has said "" it is not in the power of Iran to destroy the state of Israel "" , and that "" the growing Haredi radicalisation poses a bigger risk than Ahmadinejad "" .
Then there is the current head of the Mossad , Tamir Pardo , who is said to have told an audience of Israeli diplomats in December that a nuclear - armed Iran would not constitute an "" existential threat "" to Israel .
But this is n't just about spymasters or generals .
There is no consensus favouring military action against Iran within Israel 's political establishment either .
Recent media reports have suggested Netanyahu and Barak are isolated within their own cabinet ; Daniel Ben - Simon , a Labour party member of the Israeli parliament , has called them "" a two - man show "" – or , as a recent headline in the New York Times put it , "" Two Israeli leaders make the Iran issue their own "" .
Shaul Mofaz , the opposition leader – of the Kadima party and a former head of the Israeli army – has objected to Netanyahu 's obsession with attacking Iran . ""
The greatest threat to the state of Israel is not nuclear Iran , "" Mofaz said in an interview earlier this month , citing the unresolved conflict with the Palestinians as a much more pressing issue .
The Israeli president , Shimon Peres , told CNN in November that he preferred a "" moral "" attack on Iran , not a military one .
Oh , and guess what ?
The Israeli public is far from gung - ho .
According to a poll released last month by the Israeli Democracy Institute and Tel Aviv University , 63 % of Israelis oppose a unilateral Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities .
An earlier poll , for the University of Maryland in February , revealed only a fifth of Israelis favoured a strike on Iran without the support of the United States .
There is an important lesson here for the west 's hawks and doves alike .
The hawks in the Commons and Congress who invoke Israel 's national security as the chief justification for a pre - emptive attack on Iran are ignoring the expert opinions of Israel 's own military and intelligence chiefs , both past and present .
Meanwhile , the doves who take to the streets with anti - war placards that blame the Jewish state for exaggerating the threat from Iran should consider replacing the word "" Israel "" with "" Netanyahu "" .
It is the cynical and belligerent "" Bibi "" who takes every opportunity to fear - monger about a Nazi - like threat from Iran .
In a speech this month to mark the Holocaust , he proclaimed : "" People who refuse to see the Iranian threat have learned nothing from the Shoah [ Holocaust ] . ""
And last month in the US , he compared bombing Iran to bombing Auschwitz .
But Netanyahu is n't Israel – a nation of 7.8 million people , including 1.6 million Arabs .
Those of us opposed to another catastrophic conflict in the Middle East should not allow his alarmist and messianic rhetoric to drown out the voices of Israel 's doves : those critics of military action , who , ironically , are far more numerous and outspoken than the doves on Capitol Hill or in Westminster , and have far better credentials .
Just as it is wrong to reduce Iran to Ahmadinejad , or the US to George Bush , it is wrong , and counter - productive , to reduce Israel to Netanyahu .
Its ordinary citizens do n't want war with Iran , and the country 's top spooks and soldiers are queueing up to tell us why .

2012-05-05,"Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has suffered a major setback after his supporters fared badly in Iranian parliamentary elections .
Supporters of the populist president were relegated to a small fraction of the parliament , hugely outnumbered by the conservatives closely linked with the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Results announced by the Interior Ministry showed the United Principilist Front , closely linked with Khamenei and critical of Ahmadinejad , in the lead , with the hardline Resistance Front of the Islamic Revolution close behind .
The Resistance Front also backs Khamenei but some of its members have served under Ahmadinejad and still support him .
Of 65 seats for grabs in Friday 's runoff election , Ahmadinejad 's final results are expected later on Saturday .
As in the first round , parties directly aligned with Ahmadinejad did not fare well .
His opponents won 20 while the president 's supporters won only eight seats .
Independents had a strong showing , winning 11 seats so far , which may help the president in what is expected to be a tough final year in office .
Results for the rest , including the capital Tehran are expected later on Saturday .
About nine Ahmadinejad supporters are likely to win seats in Tehran where they were in a neck - and - neck race .
The president 's opponents are almost certain to win the remaining 16 seats .
The conservatives had previously backed Ahmadinejad , but then turned against him after he was perceived to challenge the authority of senior clerics .
His allies are likely to be ousted from key posts , and his economic policies challenged .
Ahmadinejad 's opponents had already won an outright majority in the 290-member legislature in the first round of voting in March .
Iran 's major reformist parties , who oppose both Ahmadinejad and the conservatives , mostly did not field candidates .
The new parliament will begin its sessions in late May.
It has no direct control over major policy matters such as Iran 's nuclear programme , but it can influence the runup to the election of Ahmadinejad 's successor in 2013 .
Iran has touted the turnout for Friday 's elections as a show of support for the country 's religious leadership in their confrontation with the west over Tehran 's controversial nuclear programme . ""
Mass turnout in runoff parliamentary elections , "" declared a front - page headline in the government - run Iran Daily . ""
The vote is support for the ruling system as it faces the US and its allies over the nuclear programme ...
The vote also means that tensions will increase between Ahmadinejad and his opponents in the incoming parliament , "" said political analyst Ali Reza Khamesian .
Ahmadinejad saw his political fortunes decline sharply after he was perceived to have defied Khamenei in April 2011 over the appointment of an intelligence chief and trying to expand the authority of the presidency ."
2012-05-17,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has said he would like to come to the London Olympics but will not be attending because Britain has "" a problem "" with him .
His decision to stay away highlights a dilemma for the British government , which faces an unprecedented influx of leaders from unsavoury regimes for the opening ceremony on 27 July .
Ahmadinejad did not give details of the "" problem "" but made it clear he had been keen to travel to London to support Iran 's Olympic team .
Speaking at Tehran 's Azadi sports complex , he told a group of athletes : "" I would like to go .
But unfortunately they have a problem with my presence .
Otherwise I would have liked to have participated in the Olympics , and to have applauded our dear youth . ""
Iran 's state media this week speculated that Ahmadinejad was unwilling to submit to the fingerprinting necessary to obtain a British visa – seeing this as an unacceptable and humiliating procedure .
The Iranian leader is not subject to an EU travel ban and , theoretically , could have entered the UK to join other world leaders .
Britain is in a standoff with Iran over the country 's nuclear programme , and closed its embassy last year after pro - government protesters ransacked it .
Ahmadinejad asserted that "" the enemies "" did not want Iran 's sportsmen to win medals but said they would bring pride to the nation like the mythical Persian hero Arash .
Downing Street will privately be relieved that Ahmadinejad is staying away .
But others heads of state from controversial regimes will be coming to London , in what is turning into a growing public relations headache for David Cameron .
Some 120 heads of state have said they will attend the opening ceremony .
It will be the largest top - level international gathering in diplomatic history , the Foreign Office believes .
The number far exceeds the 87 leaders who travelled to Beijing in 2008 .
The foreign secretary , William Hague , has refused to disclose the guest list , as campaigners this week called on Britain to withdraw invitations to "" dictators "" from countries with poor human - rights records .
Several are already on an EU blacklist ; they include Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe , Syria 's Bashar al - Assad , and Belarus 's Alexander Lukashenko .
But other authoritarian leaders not on the list are likely to travel to London .
Uzbekistan 's despotic leader Islam Karimov and his Turkmen counterpart Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov both visited the Beijing Olympics in 2008 .
According to Hugh Williamson , director of Human Rights Watch 's Europe and central Asia division , the two post - Soviet republics are "" absolutely in the category of the worst dictatorships in the world and the worst abusers of human rights "" .
Williamson said he was not in favour of banning anyone from attending the Games .
But he said Cameron should send a "" very clear signal "" on human rights by refusing to meet either Karimov and Berdymukhamedov in London , and denying them the "" legitimacy "" of being at the event .
The prime minister should also raise the treatment of opposition demonstrators in Russia and the situation in the North Caucasus with Russia 's president Vladimir Putin , he said .
It remains unclear if Putin will actually come to London .
Moscow is sending more than 400 athletes to the Games and is hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi .
But Putin is displeased with Britain for granting asylum to Kremlin critics and has refused to attend this weekend 's G8 summit hosted in the US by Barack Obama .
The former Europe minister Denis MacShane this week asked Hague to clarify who had not been "" invited "" .
Hague has yet to reply .
MacShane – a critic of the coalition 's business - focused foreign policy – said the list of heads of state not welcome at the Games should be extended to include Bahrain , Syria , China , Zimbabwe and Saudi Arabia .
Putin and Ukraine 's leader Viktor Yanukovych should also be discouraged unless they did better on human rights , he said .
Germany 's chancellor , Angela Merkel , has announced she will not travel to Ukraine for next month 's 2012 European football championship unless Yanukovych frees the jailed opposition leader , Yulia Tymoshenko .
Ukraine is co - hosting the tournament with Poland .
There is also a campaign to move the 2014 world ice hockey championship out of Belarus .
Downing Street , however , has been reluctant to take a strong stand on human rights during the Olympics .
Speaking 100 days before the Games , the culture secretary , Jeremy Hunt , said Britain did not intend to use the event to "" preach about our values "" , arguing : "" There are many other forums where that can happen .
"" On Thursday MacShane said that Downing Street should "" take the lead on human rights "" and reject the mantra "" sport über alles "" . ""
Hunt 's judgment has enough question marks against it without him pretending that egregious human rights violations can be ignored in the interests of the money men who control international sport , "" he said .
"" An awful lot of viewers around the world will wonder why the red carpet is being rolled out for people who do such terrible things in their own countries .
Maybe William Hague could ask Sacha Baron Cohen to represent all these dictators .
He [ Baron Cohen ] could wear a nice uniform , lots of medals , a beard , and carry on his private torture case . ""
The Foreign Office is wrestling with the problem of what to do about Olympic representatives from Syria and Bahrain .
General Mowaffak Joumaa , head of Syria 's Olympic committee , has signalled he intends to come .
Joumaa has close links with Syria 's president , Bashar al - Assad , but is not subject to a travel ban .
Ricken Patel , executive director of the global campaign group Avaaz , told the Guardian : "" General Joumaa is a senior member of the brutal Syrian regime which is killing and torturing innocent civilians .
Allowing a member of Assad 's armed forces to lead Syria into the world 's biggest sporting event is a direct affront to the thousands of Syrians who have lost their lives over the past year .
If the British government is serious about clamping down on this regime and ending the bloodshed , Assad 's generals must be barred from enjoying the bright lights of the London Olympics . ""
Sheikh Nasser bin Hamad Al Khalifa of Bahrain – a country that has also dealt brutally with opposition protesters – wants to attend too ."
2012-05-29,"Do the Olympics mark an unmissable opportunity for twentysomething North Korean leader Kim Jong - un ?
Not for a visit , you understand –
Kim Jong - un is one of those leaders with whom , in the insouciant words of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the 2012 organisers "" have a problem "" .
But the imagination is stirred by reports that Kim recently toured a bullet factory and shooting range to offer guidance as to how his country 's sporting marksmen could become more successful .
Such a fascinating detail forces a call to the North Korean embassy – based in a detached house in leafy Ealing – where I ask an attache whether Kim will be offering formal coaching to Team DPRK .
After all , the coach of North Korea 's 2010 World Cup squad claimed the late Kim Jong - il was directing the side via an "" invisible mobile phone "" of his own invention .
There is a long pause .
"" I could n't speak about this . ""
Is Kim the athlete his father was ?
( You 'll recall the Dear Leader 's first round of golf featured five holes in one and he finished 38 under par . )
"" Well , we are not sure , "" comes the diplomat 's apparently less than diplomatic response , suggesting whispers of Kim 's sporting genius have yet to percolate down to his dominion 's more suburban outposts .
Either way , the Games may offer the North Korean regime the chance to cement its position as purveyor of the finest excuses for disappointing athletic performance .
At the 2010 World Cup ( where North Korea posted an eminently respectable 2 - 1 loss to Brazil ) , the national coach blamed their opening defeat on the fact that "" most "" of the players had been struck by lightning a month before during training .
And only a year before , state media had announced the entire side had been poisoned before a World Cup qualifier on the personal orders of the South Korean president .
Exciting developments , meanwhile , in this column 's search for an Olympic - appropriate sponsor .
A partnership with Chicken Cottage is looking likely , but that could all change if we get the nod from longtime London favourite Kenssy Fried Chicken , whose name and logo have always stood as two greasy fingers to the trademark of Kentucky Fried Chicken magnate Colonel Sanders .
We 'll know more by Friday .
Speaking of The Colonel , it is well known among the cognoscenti that the world is in fact run by a secret society of the five richest individuals or entities , called the Pentaverate – which included Colonel Sanders before he went tits up , as well as the Queen , the Vatican , the Gettys , and the Rothschilds …
but if you want your eyes opened , then YouTube Mike Myers 's Pentaverate speech from So I Married An Axe Murderer .
And so to London 2012 's burgeoning conspiracy culture .
Now , you may be one of those benighted folk convinced the "" conspiracy "" is visible in broad daylight – namely , the decision to quadruple the original budget at the same time as allowing the IOC and its corporate partners to override all manner of laws and freedoms .
I 'm afraid you could n't be more wrong .
Type London 2012 into YouTube , and two of the 10 most popular searches include "" the Illuminati "" .
Our doughty truthseekers do n't always agree , but on 2012 there 's quite the consensus .
I 'm afraid I 'm too stupid to understand a lot of it , but the upshot seems to be the prediction of an imminent false flag attack – a terrorist assault during the Games that will be blamed on some 13th fairy like Ahmadinejad , but will actually be the work of the Illuminati .
Evidence ?
Well , take a look at the triangular floodlights in the Olympic stadium , and just try telling the conspiracists that they are n't specifically modelled after the Great Seal , the eye - topped pyramid on the US dollar bill which sits above the motto "" Novis ordo seclorum "" that is so often mistranslated as New World Order ( see above ) .
Do note David Cameron posing just underneath one of these floodlight structures .
Why ?
Because he 's one of them .
They ALL are .
Incidentally , conspiracy theorists moved to email me between one and several hundred times tonight – or to post screeds of comments – may care to know that all these are literally printed out and shredded into the false snow which hides the entrance to the Rothschilds ' fortress of solitude in the Canadian Rockies .
So work out whether you want to be part of the problem or part of the solution .
However , exemption will be granted for claims that those wishing to take over the stadium post - Games are Illuminati operatives .
I ca n't see Leyton Orient 's Barry Hearn making the cut , but if the two Davids , Sullivan and Gold , of West Ham are the Official Bongo Partner of the New World Order , then I want to hear about it ."

Ties are not the only objectionable part of western culture – Iran 's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad strongly objected to Paul the soothsaying octopus .

2012-06-07,"If the last round of Iranian nuclear talks in Baghdad were preceded by what turned out to be excessive optimism , the next round , due to take place in Moscow starting June 17 , is suffering from the other extreme .
Expectations are so low , the talks are in danger of not happening at all .
Iran has gone on a media offensive in the past few days , with both President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the chief negotiator ,
Saeed Jalili blaming the EU foreign policy chief , Catherine Ashton , of failing to make adequate preparations for the Moscow round .
According to the Mehr news agency , Jalili wrote to Ashton yesterday to complain about ' dithering ' : The other side 's delay in holding meetings between deputies and experts put into question their determination to hold positive negotiations in Moscow .
The Islamic Republic of Iran , with a clear logic and definite initiatives , is ready to engage in forward - looking negotiations for cooperation .
European officials say they are ready to talk on the highest level , as long as it is about substance rather than mere protocol and process , and that Helga Schmid , Ashton 's deputy tasked with arranging the talks , spelled this out in a letter to her Iranian counterpart , Ali Bagheri , in reply his initial message suggesting talks .
But Bagheri wrote a second time , not acknowledging Schmid 's letter , repeating his earlier language .
A European official said : Basically we have said to the Iranians we are ready to meet at whatever level required to talk about substance .
We do n't think it 's necessary to have a meeting to talk about protocol and process .
We are pushing for a Bagheri - Schmid call today and we have been offering direct contact between Jalili - Ashton for about a week .
The lesson we learned in Baghdad is that we ca n't allow all the discussion to get taken up by protocol and process so that there is no time left for substance
The worrying signs here are that Tehran is going public with its gripes and not engaging directly with Ashton 's office , which acts as convenor for a six - nation group representing the international community ( US , UK , France , Germany , China and Russia ) .
The tone of the Bagheri and Jalili letters is apparently quite declaratory , as if intended primarily for publication rather than negotiation .
When things were going well , the Iranians kept the exchanges between Schmid and Bagheri secret , to the point , and businesslike .
This could mean that Tehran sees no future in the talks if a recognition of its right to enrich uranium and sanctions relief are not on the table as part of an initial deal .
The six - nation group said in Baghdad that such issues would have to be part of a final settlement and have no place in an initial confidence - building agreement .
The flurry of Iranian letters looks like an attempt to apportion blame in expectation of a breakdown .
European diplomats are hoping that it is no more than gamesmanship and that Iran has too much at stake in the talks to walk out , not least the risk of angering the Russian hosts ."

2012-06-28,"Conflicting reports have emerged over the brief detention of the Iranian foreign minister , by an anti - terror unit at Larnaca International Airport on his official visit to Cyprus .
Both Iranian and Cyprus governments denied media reports that Salehi was arrested temporarily because his name was listed on an outdated EU travel ban targeting Iranian officials including those involved in the country 's controversial nuclear programme .
Salehi , a former head of the Iranian atomic energy organisation , was previously banned from entering EU countries but restrictions on him were lifted when president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad promoted him to foreign minister in December 2010 .
The Turkish media organisation , TRT , reported on the website of its Persian language service that Salehi was arrested but shortly released by anti - terrorism police in the airport .
Some Twitter users posted a photo they said was from Salehi in handcuffs but its authenticity has since been questioned .
But , speaking to Cyprus Mail , an English language newspaper published in the country , justice minister , Loucas Louca , said Salehi was "" delayed "" because of miscommunication between the police and the foreign ministry about his current travel situation . ""
Despite his visit being planned in advance , on arrival at the old Larnaca airport ( where the VIP hall stands ) , airport police found themselves in a brief quandary as to what to do , after discovering that the visiting dignitary 's name was on the stop list , "" reported Cyprus Mail , an English language newspaper published in Cyprus .
The Cyprus government vehemently denied that there had been a "" diplomatic incident "" involving the Iranian foreign minister .
Speaking to the Guardian , the government spokesman Stefanos Stefanou said any suggestion that Ali Akbar Salehi had been arraigned while visiting the island in an official capacity earlier this week was "" simply not true . ""
"" Nothing happened during his visit .
It 's simply not true that the foreign minister was arrested , "" Stefanou said .
"" There was no diplomatic incident as Politis [ a local newspaper ] reported .
The story was based on misinformation .
I have no idea where the minister is now
but it is certain he is not in Cyprus . ""
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman , Ramin Mehmanparast , also denied the media reports .
Last week , president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad faced domestic embarrassment after being declared persona non grata in Brazil , snubbed by his Brazilian counterpart , Dilma Rousseff , and ending up posing pictures with airport bodyguards"
2012-07-13,"When Israeli pop superstar Rita Jahanforuz told her friends she wanted to record an album in Farsi , they thought she must have gone mad .
The 50-year - old Iranian - born , Jewish singer , who is usually known just by her first name , recalled : "" ' They all said , ' You want to record an album in the language of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ?
Who will listen to it ? '
I did n't know why I had to do it , I just did .
It 's like someone lit a match .
What 's happening now is beyond what I ever imagined .
"" What 's happening now is the rarest of musical occurrences – an album that is a big hit simultaneously in both Israel and Iran .
My Joys – composed of popular Iranian ballads sung in Farsi – went gold in Israel within three weeks of its release .
Sales figures from Iran are harder to come by , though reports indicate it has flown off the shelves of those music shops that covertly sold the CD with a blank cover .
Determined Iranian fans are using sophisticated software to bypass the Islamic regime 's tight internet controls and download the album and playing it at weddings and underground nightclubs across Tehran .
Admiring anything Israeli , let alone a sexy female singer , is risky in Iran .
Women are forbidden from performing in public .
Female musicians that do perform give clandestine concerts in the basements of private homes . ""
Music from Israel is interesting because it comes from the epitome of evil – people are curious , "" said Liora Hendelmann - Baavur , expert in Iranian popular culture at Tel Aviv University .
Officials in Tehran were not impressed .
While the Washington Post has hailed her as an "" anti - war spokesperson "" , Fars , a news agency affiliated with Iran 's government , accused Rita of being Israel 's "" latest plot in a soft war "" .
Rita finds this idea hilarious .
In response , she flicked through her iPhone , searching for an email she considered much more significant than the opinion of the military guard .
"" I 'm from Iran .
I do n't know you
but I would like to express my feelings about you
…
I love you ,
I love you , I love you .
God bless you and your country , "" she said , reading out the email .
She then exclaimed triumphantly : "" These are the real people !
They understand that I am trying to show Iran 's real culture , it 's true beautiful self , which has become lost to the outside world because of its government .
"" There are 250,000 Iranian Jews living in Israel , of which Rita is probably the most famous and well - loved .
She was named the country 's "" top female singer of the past 60 years "" during anniversary celebrations in 2010 .
She clings to her Iranian roots but is proudly Israeli .
Her family moved to Israel in 1970 when she was eight but Rita remembers her childhood in Iran with fond nostalgia .
Her earliest memories are of her mother singing and dancing through the house , songs she has revisited on this album .
A tribute to this early inspiration , the diva invited her 72-year - old mother to sing the album 's final track .
Rita remembers seeing her father sitting , glued to the radio , smoking cigarette after cigarette .
When she asked what was wrong , she remembers her mother telling her that there was a war in Israel – the six - day war of 1967 .
"" I could n't understand the idea of war .
I could grasp one person or a couple of people being angry with each other but how could a whole country of people be angry at exactly the same time with a whole other country of people ?
"" she asked . ""
In the end , what matters is not the few people at the top , it is us , the people .
The reaction to this album has convinced me that love is the only reasonable action in the world . ""

2012-07-18,"Three human rights organisations have called on the Iranian authorities to "" immediately and unconditionally "" release an ailing Kurdish journalist and activist whose health conditions "" have drastically deteriorated "" after staging lengthy hunger strikes .
Mohammad Seddigh Kaboudvand , 50 , is currently serving a 10-and - a - half - year prison term in Tehran 's Evin prison after being found guilty of "" acting against the national security "" for establishing the Human Rights Organisation of Kurdistan and proposing a campaign to boycott the 9th presidential election which brought Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to office in 2005 .
Amnesty International , the International Federation for Human Rights ( FIDH ) , and its affiliate , the Iranian League for the Defence of Human Rights ( LDDHI ) said in a joint statement that "" the Iranian authorities are responsible for any risks "" to Mohammad Seddigh Kaboudvand as a result of his ongoing hunger strike .
Kaboudvand who was named the international journalist of the year at the British Press Awards in 2009 , is on hunger strike since May in protest at the Iranian authorities ' refusal to grant him permission to visit his sick son .
Kaboudvand 's son , Pejman , was diagnosed with a rare blood condition and has been "" gravely ill "" in a Tehran hospital for five months , putting the family under immense emotional and financial pressure . ""
Mohammad Sadiq Kabudvand is a prisoner of conscience , held solely for his journalistic and human rights work and the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression .
He should never have been arrested in the first place , and must be released immediately and unconditionally so that he is free to be with his family at this distressing time , "" said Ann Harrison , the deputy director of Amnesty International 's Middle East and North Africa Programme .
Her comments were echoed by Karim Lahidji , the vice president of the FIDH and President of the LDDHI who warned that the responsibility for Kaboudvand 's health rest on the hands of the Iranian authorities .
"" The Iranian authorities are responsible for any possible risks to Mohammad Sadiq Kaboudvand 's life as a result of his continuing hunger strike and his deteriorating conditions , "" he said .
"" Under the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners , the Iranian authorities are obliged to take immediate action to provide urgent medical care to Mohammad Sadiq Kaboudvand .
They must stop further tormenting a father by denying him the right to visit his ailing son . ""
In an open letter sent from inside jail in May , Kaboudvand described the reasons behind his hunger strike as : "" The Prosecutor and the security apparatuses continue to deny [ prison ] leave because of their enmity , grudge and malice towards me as a human rights activist ; this despite my having served half of my illegal and unjust prison sentence and my son 's incurable diseases and acute emergency situation ...
Therefore , to protest the illegal and inhumane behaviour of these judicial and security officials , I launch an indefinite hunger strike as of 9 PM , Saturday 26 May 2012 "" .
In the latest round of harassment against Kaboudvand 's family , activists said that security officials have recently prevented his family 's access to the media by disconnecting their house landline and his wife 's mobile .
Before being imprisoned , Kaboudvand was the editor of the weekly magazine Payam - e Mardom ( Message of the People ) and co - founded the Human Rights Organization of Kurdistan with other activists which documented and publicised widespread rights ' abuses committed by the government security forces in the Kurdish areas in western Iran .
His commitment to the protection of human rights earned him international recognition from organisations such as New York - based Human Rights Watch ."
2012-08-07,"The visit of the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , to Saudi Arabia comes at a crucial time for the conflict in Syria .
Few observers can be optimistic about the chances for diplomacy , with the Annan plan abandoned and the quieter efforts at reaching a US - Russia deal stalled .
Most analysts predict that Syria 's uprising against dictatorship – which began as a peaceful cross - sectarian movement calling for basic freedoms – will increasingly mutate into a sectarian civil war .
Much of the western policy debate is moving on to the risks of prolonged state failure in a post - Assad future .
Within the Arab world , the debate over Syria is increasingly becoming polarised along ideological and sectarian lines , as the country 's strategic importance to the region 's great powers seems to be obscuring the commonalities between the basic demands of the Syrian protesters and their counterparts in other Arab countries .
Any efforts to draw back from the brink – and to stop the Syrian uprising against dictatorship being derailed by a sectarian regional proxy war – deserve attention .
Ahmadinejad 's visit , which an aide has said will go ahead , is a rare one .
He last visited Saudi Arabia in 2007 , at a time when the Gulf states were trying so hard to reach out to Iran that Qatar even invited him to join in the annual summit of the Gulf Co - operation Council ( the regional organisation representing the six Gulf Arab monarchies , which was founded in 1981 partly in response to the perceived threat of the Iranian revolution ) .
Although there is a long history of rivalry and competition between the Gulf Arab countries and Iran , relations have not always been so conflicted .
Back in 2008 , Ahmadinejad visited Bahrain and signed an agreement for Iran to supply Bahrain with natural gas .
The deal , which seems almost unthinkable today , never materialised .
By contrast , Ahmadinejad 's most recent foray to the other side of the Gulf was in April , when he toured Abu Musa , an island occupied by Iran but claimed by the UAE .
This prompted fury in the Gulf monarchies , where rulers saw it as a sign of Iranian expansionist tendencies , and were frustrated by the lack of reaction from their western allies ( who were preparing for talks with Iran over the nuclear issue and who are not deeply engaged on the islands issue ) .
It is in Syria that the Saudi - Iranian confrontation has become the most pronounced and dangerous , but the two are competing for influence in the wider region .
They back rival camps in Iraq , Lebanon , and to some extent Yemen and the Palestinian territories ( though Hamas has always had some support in the Gulf and is now distancing itself from both Iran and Syria ) .
They are also at odds over the treatment of Shia protesters in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia 's own eastern province .
Saudi officials routinely suggest that Iran is fomenting the protests in both cases .
For its part , Iran 's interests seem to be best served by giving only moral support to the protesters , so it can sit back and watch its rivals challenged from within , without the kind of direct involvement that could spark retaliation .
Both Iran and Saudi Arabia are effective exploiters of "" soft power "" , making use of their various media channels and religious networks to try to discredit the other .
One of the disadvantages of this approach is that it is never quite clear how centralised the control of foreign policy really is .
Another problem is that the Middle Eastern media are becoming increasingly sectarian – a trend that is worrying many people in the ethnically and religiously diverse countries of the Gulf .
Now , with the collapse of Kofi Annan 's mission to Syria , the Gulf Arab monarchies are becoming more open about their support for the Syrian opposition , including the armed Free Syrian Army .
Saudi Arabia has hosted a variety of Syrian opposition visitors , from members of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood to Assad 's estranged uncle , Rifaat al - Assad and Manaf Tlass , a senior Syrian military officer who defected just a few weeks ago .
The latter visitors illustrate that Saudi Arabia is not only supporting the Islamist opposition ; it has its own concerns about the rising regional influence of the Muslim Brotherhood , whose focus on electoral politics represents a major challenge to the Saudi model of partnership between clerics and hereditary rulers .
The UAE is also pursuing a delicate balancing act , as it is home to a number of Syrian National Council activists – who recently announced the defection of the Syrian ambassador to the UAE – but is extremely wary of the role the Muslim Brotherhood could play in its own territory , and is investigating around 50 imprisoned Islamist political activists who are accused of conspiring with foreign organisations .
Even before the Annan mission collapsed , the Saudi and UAE foreign ministers were expressing extreme frustration with what they see as international inaction over Syria .
Saudi Arabia has never seemed particularly convinced by western diplomatic efforts ; Kofi Annan did not visit Riyadh during his Syria mediation efforts , and neither Saudi Arabia nor Iran was included in the last "" Friends of Syria "" meeting .
Most indications point to further conflict rather than a diplomatic resolution .
But in the highly personalised realm of Saudi politics , a personal invitation from the king is symbolically important .
In Lebanon , in 2008 and 2009 , the confrontation between the Saudi - backed 14 March alliance and the Iranian - backed 8 March alliance occasionally looked like it could lead to renewed civil conflict .
But there , the rival factions stepped back from the brink , negotiating power - sharing agreements before and after the 2009 elections .
This would be far harder to achieve in Syria , with its daily bloodshed and its asymmetry of forces , but the cost of conflict is high enough for any remaining diplomatic options to be worth exploring ."
2012-08-17,"The faultlines among Israel 's leaders over whether to take unilateral military action against Iran 's nuclear capability have deepened , with a prime ministerial aide launching a stinging public rebuke to President Shimon Peres after he said that the country should not act alone . ""
Shimon Peres forgets what the role of the president of Israel is , "" an official from Binyamin Netanyahu 's office was quoted in the Israeli media as saying .
The row – a stark example of the sharp disagreements at the heart of Israel 's political , military and intelligence establishment over the issue – came as Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , said Israel 's existence was "" an insult to all humanity "" .
In a speech to mark al - Quds Day on the last Friday of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan , Ahmadinejad told a rally in Tehran that "" the Zionist regime and the Zionists are a cancerous tumour "" and warned against "" one cell of them [ being ] left in one inch of [ Palestinian ] land in the future "" .
He added : "" The nations of the region will soon finish off the usurper Zionists in the Palestinian land … A new Middle East will definitely be formed .
With the grace of God and help of the nations , in the new Middle East there will be no trace of the Americans and Zionists . ""
The Iranian president has traditionally used al - Quds Day , on which rallies in support of the Palestinian people are held in many Muslim countries , to deliver invective against Israel .
His words will inevitably be used to bolster arguments in favour of military action to prevent a nuclear - armed Iran .
Speculation has intensified recently that Netanyahu and defence minister Ehud Barak are considering launching action this autumn , before the US presidential election .
In an interview on Israeli television , Peres said : "" It is clear to us we can not do it on our own .
We can only delay [ Iran 's progress ] .
Thus it 's clear to us that we need to go together with America .
There are questions of co - operation and timetables , but as severe as the danger is , at least this time we 're not alone . ""
He said he was confident that the US would take action , but added : "" My estimate is that they will not do this before the elections , which are more than 80 days away . ""
Following the remarks , Netanyahu 's office openly attacked the president 's judgment , suggesting three previous occasions when it had been wrong .
The first , according to an aide quoted in the Israeli media , was after the Oslo accords were signed in 1993 , when Peres "" thought there would be a new Middle East "" .
The second was following Israel 's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005 when "" he thought there would be peace …
but in reality we got missiles "" .
The aide continued : "" But Peres 's biggest mistake was in 1981 when he opposed [ Israel 's ] bombing of the Iraqi reactor .
Luckily , prime minister Menachem Begin ignored him .
"" Peres later stood by his comments , saying : "" I say what is in my heart with a loud and clear voice . ""
The president 's views echoed those of many former and current military , intelligence and political figures in Israel .
US officials have also made repeated efforts to dissuade Netanyahu and Barak from unilateral action .
Earlier this week , the US chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , Martin Dempsey , said that Israel did not have the capacity to eliminate Iran 's nuclear programme .
"" I may not know about all of their capabilities .
But I think it 's a fair characterisation to say that they could delay but not destroy Iran 's nuclear capabilities , "" he told reporters .
Some observers believe that the current frenzied speculation about a possible Israeli strike this autumn is aimed at forcing an unequivocal public statement in the coming weeks from President Barack Obama on America 's willingness to take military action against Iran , should diplomacy and sanctions fail .
According to an opinion poll by the Israel Democracy Institute and Tel Aviv University , 60 % of Israeli Jews are against a strike on Iran without US co - operation .
Eleven per cent strongly support unilateral action by Israel ."
2012-08-29,"The UN secretary general , Ban Ki - moon , arrived in Tehran on Wednesday on a two - day visit for a summit of the Non - Aligned Movement and meeting with senior Iranian officials including the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and its president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Ban 's Tehran visit is a blow to western attempts to isolate the Islamic republic over its disputed nuclear programme and is made in defiance of Israeli and American calls to boycott the event .
Within hours of arriving in the Iranian capital , Ban met with the parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani and president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and was due to meet Khamenei .
He is expected to press Iran over its handling of its controversial nuclear dossier and urge Iranian leaders to comply with their human rights obligations .
As Tehran is trying to exploit Ban 's visit to show a country unaffected by sanctions and isolation , activists have called on the UN chief to meet with the opposition leaders who are under house arrest and highlight the plight of political prisoners who are held in a notorious prison not far from the summit 's venue in north of the capital .
Larijani is reported to have frowned when Ban expressed concerns over Iran 's human rights record .
"" We have discussed how United Nations can work together with Iran to improve the human rights situation in Iran .
We have our serious concerns on the human rights abuses and violations in this country , "" he said , according to the AP .
Several heads of state and government from the movement 's 120 nation will attend the summit , including Mohamed Morsi whose visit as the first Egyptian president to Tehran since the 1979 Islamic revolution will be a landmark between their bilateral relations .
Other high - profile figures include Manmohan Singh , the prime minister of India , a country that has not abide by the western economic sanctions on Tehran and has continued its bilateral trade despite pressure .
In Tehran , Singh is accompanied by a group of Indian businessmen trying to secure trade opportunities with their Iranian counterparts .
With Saudi Arabia , Qatar and Bahrain attending the summit despite their differences over the regional conflicts , the Syrian crisis is expected to be among the most contagious issues to be discussed .
Iran is among the staunch supporters of the Bashar al - Assad 's regime while Saudi Arabia and Qatar have publicly supported the rebels .
From Syria , the newly - appointed prime minister , Wael Nader al - Halqi , also arrived in Tehran on Wednesday and from Bahrain , the foreign minister Sheikh Khaled bin Ahmed al - Khalifa is attending the summit despite recent Tehran - Manama spat over the Bahraini protests .
During the summit , Iran 's deputy foreign minister , Hossein Amir Abdullahian , said on Wednesday that his country would be proposing a three - month ceasefire plan for the Syrian crisis .
"" Iran 's proposal to the meeting of members of the Non - Aligned Movement to solve the Syria issue is to recommend a ceasefire and the implementation of national reconciliation talks in the country , "" he said , according to the state - run Irna news agency .
Upon arrival in Tehran , Ban was quoted by Iranian media as saying that Iran can play a "" crucially important role in the resolution of the regional conflicts "" , a reference apparently to the conflict in Syria ."
2012-09-06,"As foreign diplomats in Tehran were packing their suitcases to return home after a summit of the Non - Aligned Movement at the weekend , Zhila Bani - Yaghoub was packing hers to head to Evin prison .
In Evin 's women wing , where she is expected to stay behind bars for one year as punishment for her work as a journalist , Bani - Yaghoub was reunited with some of her close friends and colleagues already in that very notorious prison , activists such as Nasrin Sotoudeh , Bahareh Hedayat and Mahsa Amrabadi .
In 2010 , the 42-year - old activist was sentenced to one year in prison on charges of "" spreading propaganda against the regime "" and "" insulting president [ Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ] "" because of the articles she wrote during the campaign period at the time of Iran 's 2009 presidential elections .
Bani - Yaghoub , the editor of a women 's rights website , Focus on Iranian Women , is additionally banned from media and journalistic work for 30 years , Amnesty International said .
In the aftermath of Iran 's post - election unrest , Bani - Yaghoub was arrested along with her husband , Bahman Ahmadi Amouie , who was the editor of the business daily paper Sarmayeh at the time .
Amouie is currently held in Rajai - Shahr prison , serving a five year and four months jail term for conviction on charges of "" gathering and colluding with intent to harm national security "" , "" spreading propaganda against the system "" , "" disrupting public security "" and "" insulting the president "" .
While Bani - Yaghoub and her friend Mahsa Amrabadi are kept in Tehran 's Evin prison , their husbands ( Amouie and Masoud Bastani ) remain behind bars in another prison in the city of Karaj .
Amnesty International has described Bani - Yaghoub as "" a prisoner of conscious "" and has urged Iran to "" immediately and unconditionally "" release her . ""
The Iranian authorities must immediately and unconditionally release Zhila Bani - Yaghoub , who is a prisoner of conscience held solely for peacefully exercising her rights to freedom of expression and allow her to resume her profession , "" said Amnesty 's deputy programme director for Middle East and North Africa , Ann Harrison . ""
Journalists in Iran face numerous restrictions on their legitimate work , including peaceful criticism of the authorities and reporting on human rights .
The Iranian authorities must relax unlawful restrictions on them and release all journalists held solely for their journalism and human rights work , "" she added .
Iran is one of the world 's worst jailers of journalists , according to the New York - based the the Committee to Protect Journalists ( CPJ ) .
Evin is home to some of the most respected Iranian journalists and activists including human rights lawyer Sotoudeh who has defended several political activists as well as juvenile offenders .
In jail , Sotoudeh has joined some her of own clients .
Tuesday marked the second anniversary of imprisoning Sotoudeh who is serving a six - year jail term .
Iranian human rights webiste Hrana also reported on Thursday that another activist , Shiva Nazar Ahari , has also gone to Evin to serve her sentence .
In January 2011 , a six - year jail sentence for Nazar Ahari , a 26-year - old women 's rights activist , was commuted to four years and 74 lashes in an appeals court for "" gathering and colluding against the national security "" , a vague charge used by Iran to convict several political prisoners in recent years ."
2012-09-07,"It might not be long until Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's presidential term comes to an end
but he does n't seem to believe it will finally happen .
During a recent interview on state television in which a journalist mentioned that his presidency would finish within a year , the president interjected , laughing : "" How do you know ? ""
Under Iranian law Ahmadinejad can not run for a third term , and on Friday officials announced the next election would be held on 14 June 2013 .
The last was in 2009 when Ahmadinejad took office for a second term amid allegations of fraud and unrest .
The president 's joking response prompted speculation that he planned to preserve his dwindling power by grooming someone in his inner circle as his possible successor .
Ahmadinejad 's opponents pointed the finger at his close confidant and chief of staff , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , as a likely candidate .
Mohammad Dehghan , who sits on the parliament 's executive board , criticised Ahmadinejad and accused him of pursuing a Putin / Medvedev - style reshuffle . ""
Ahmadinejad should know that Iran is not Russia and he is not Putin .
Ahmadinejad 's Medvedev [ a reference to Mashaei ] has no position among the public opinion and he will not have any position in future , "" he said , according to the semi - official Mehr news agency .
The president 's office denied suggestions that Mashaei would put his name forward for the presidency .
Mashaei fell foul of conservatives after a power struggle last year between supporters of Ahmadinejad and those close to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Khamenei 's supporters believe that the confrontation stemmed from the increasing influence of Mashaei , an opponent of greater involvement of clerics in politics , whom they described as the head of a "" deviant current "" within the president 's inner circle .
Speculation is rife about who will be Ahmadinejad 's successor .
Tehran 's mayor , Mohammad - Bagher Ghalibaf , is one name often mentioned .
Another is Saeed Jalili , the chief nuclear negotiator and a close ally of Khamenei .
Many also tip Ali Larijani , the parliamentary speaker .
One thing is clear : whoever takes the mandate , it will not be Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ."
2012-09-25,"An Iranian MP has criticised the country 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , for taking more than a hundred people with him to the UN general assembly in New York , saying the large entourage had travelled there for "" a picnic "" .
At a time when many Iranians are struggling with economic hardship because of sanctions , almost 140 people have joined their president in his final visit to New York .
Most of them are staying at the city 's luxurious Warwick hotel , where suites can cost up to £ 1,000 a night .
The president is expected to address the general assembly on Wednesday in a speech that is highly anticipated by both his opponents in Iran and those watching him for any hint about the country 's disputed nuclear programme or Tehran 's support for Bashar al - Assad 's regime in Syria .
Initially , visas had been requested for some 160 people , but the semi - official Fars news agency reported that about 20 applications were turned down , including those for members of his cabinet and two ministers .
Other Iranian sources , however , have put the numbers of those banned from US trip as high as 60 .
Ahmadinejad 's chief of staff and close confidant , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , who is despised by the rival conservatives as the head of a "" deviant current "" within the president 's inner circle , and the foreign minister Ali Akbar Salehi are accompanying him for the UN visit .
In recent days , Iranian parliamentarians and media have spoken against the number of people travelling along with Ahmadinejad to the US , a country Iranian leaders depict as their sworn enemy .
"" Many of [ the people accompanying the president ] have only travelled there for a picnic , "" protested the deputy head of the parliamentary committee on national security , Mansour Haghighatpour , according to the semi - official Ilna news agency .
It is not the first time Ahmadinejad has come under fire for taking many of his allies to such a high - profile visit .
He has faced criticism in previous years for having his staff 's families along with him abroad .
A prominent Iranian cartoonist , Touka Neyestani , reacted by publishing a cartoon on the website of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran , depicting Ahmadinejad wearing an "" I love New York "" T - shirt .
On Tuesday , a video showing Ahmadinejad reacting to the uproar about his companions while passing through gates at the UN also fuelled controversy .
Many web users who shared the video on social networking websites said the president had sworn at his opponents while others insisted his words were , in fact , not clear .
Ahmadinejad is in his final year of office and under the current Iranian law can not run for a third term .
After a series of setbacks in a power struggle with conservatives , especially over his staunch support for Mashaei , the president has lost a great deal of influence over Iranian politics , prompting many to view him as an increasingly lame duck , but despite his dwindling power at home , he is still grabbing headlines outside .
While in New York , the Iranian president gave interviews to the American media , including CNN 's Piers Morgan , and invited a group of journalists for a breakfast meeting which the New Yorker 's David Remnick said was promoted as an exchange of ideas but turned out "" to be a group interview "" .
In response to Morgan 's questions about his views on homosexuality , Ahmadinejad said : "" I 'm sorry .
Let me ask you this .
Do you believe that anyone is giving birth through homosexuality ?
Homosexuality ceases procreation .
Who has said that if you like or believe in doing something ugly , and others do not accept your behaviour , that they 're denying your freedom ? ""
In reaction to Ahmadinejad 's comments , the Iranian journalist Omid Memarian tweeted : "" # Ahmadinejad 's response to # gay issue was not much different than what Romney or Santorum might h[ave ] said .
"" Reacting to Remnick 's question about an Iranian institute recently raising the bounty on the head of Salman Rushdie amid controversy over an anti - Islam film , Ahmadinejad responded : "" Salman Rushdie , where is he now ?
…
There is no news of him .
Is he in the United States ?
If he is in the US , you should n't broadcast that , for his own safety . ""
Ahmadinejad 's visit to New York has also sparked demonstrations in front of his hotel and the UN headquarters ."
2012-09-26,"Based on past form , the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who is due to address the UN general assembly on Wednesday , will unleash a tirade against global governance sprinkled with theological lessons , insist on his country 's nuclear rights , denounce sanctions and make incendiary statements on Israel .
No matter how familiar his themes might sound , he can be confident that he still has the capacity to grab international headlines and stage an event that will cause both outrage and possibly some amusement in western circles .
In his final year in office , the 56-year - old president has increasingly become a lame duck .
And Wednesday 's speech will probably be his last chance to exploit a high - profile international platform .
Under Iranian law , Ahmadinejad can not run for a third term and is due to stand down in June 2013 .
He appears to have surpassed himself with preparations , taking more than 100 people with him to the US , a move that has infuriated his critics back home and even caused uproar among the country 's parliamentarians .
Iranian MP Mansour Haghighatpour has criticised the president for his large entourage , saying that many have accompanied him to New York for "" a picnic "" .
Ahmadinejad 's opponents in Iran are closely watching him in New York , wary of any impact his words might have on the future of their country , which is suffering from financial stringency owing to international isolation over Tehran 's disputed nuclear programme .
Conservatives suspect Ahmadinejad might use his UN appearance to bolster his political status in Iran by portraying a president still much in control .
After suffering a series of setbacks in a power struggle , Ahmadinejad and his team have lost a great deal of influence over Iranian politics .
The opposition is worried the president 's UN speech might exacerbate the country 's political and financial situation .
Those watching outside have their eyes on any hint of a change in policy over Tehran 's nuclear activities or its unwavering support for Syria 's Bashar al - Assad 's regime , subjects that are likely to be mentioned in his speech .
On the nuclear issue , Ahmadinejad may choose to highlight the recent assassinations of a handful of Iranian scientists , attempting to portray Iran as a victim of a western - led campaign against his country 's advances in science and technology .
Last year , Ahmadinejad caused uproar and provoked a diplomatic walkout by referring to 9/11 as a "" mysterious "" incident that he said was used by the US as a pretext to attack Afghanistan and Iraq .
At the time , he also reprimanded the US for killing Osama bin Laden without putting him on trial and then burying his body at sea . ""
By using their imperialistic media network , which is under the influence of colonialism , they threaten anyone who questions the Holocaust and the September 11 event with sanctions and military actions , "" he said then .
Ahmadinejad 's earlier remarks in New York this week , which can hint at the range of subjects he might touch on in his speech , include issues such as the country 's nuclear negotiations , the threat of an Israeli military strike , Syria and an Islamophobic film that has triggered protests across the Muslim world .
On the threat of war from Israel , Ahmadinejad said his country did not take them seriously .
"" We have all the defensive means at our disposal and we are ready to defend ourselves , "" he said .
Despite a plea this week by the UN secretary general , Ban Ki - moon , who warned the Iranian president recently to avoid "" incendiary rhetoric "" , Ahmadinejad has again used his New York visit to make strongly worded statements about Israel , saying the country had no roots in the Middle East and would be "" eliminated "" .
A White House spokesman reacted by describing his comments as "" characteristically disgusting , offensive and outrageous "" .
Ahmadinejad gave an interview with AP on Tuesday in which he spoke of a world where a "" new order "" would inevitably replace the era of what he called US bullying .
Earlier in his trip , in an interview with CNN 's Piers Morgan , he was questioned on his views on homosexuality .
Ahmadinejad said : "" I 'm sorry .
Let me ask you this .
Do you believe that anyone is giving birth through homosexuality ?
Homosexuality ceases procreation .
Who has said that if you like or believe in doing something ugly , and others do not accept your behaviour , that they 're denying your freedom ? ""
In another interview , when asked about an Iranian institute raising the bounty on Salman Rushdie , Ahmadinejad responded : "" Salman Rushdie , where is he now ?
…
There is no news of him .
Is he in the United States ?
If he is in the US , you should n't broadcast that , for his own safety .
"" It is perhaps unsurprising then that also accompanying Ahmadinejad 's visit to New York have been near - constant demonstrations in front of his hotel and at the UN headquarters ."
2012-09-26,"David Cameron has launched his strongest attack on the United Nations over its inaction on Syria , declaring that the blood of young children is a "" terrible stain "" on its reputation .
In a display of Britain 's impatience with Russia and China , which have blocked a series of UN security resolutions on Syria , the prime minister declared that "" no one of conscience "" could ignore the suffering .
Cameron , who was speaking to the UN general assembly shortly after the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , cited a recent report by Save the Children which said that schools were being used as torture centres .
The prime minister said : "" The blood of these young children is a terrible stain on the reputation of this United Nations .
And in particular , a stain on those who have failed to stand up to these atrocities and in some cases aided and abetted Assad 's reign of terror .
"" If the United Nations charter is to have any value in the 21st century we must now join together to support a rapid political transition .
And at the same time no one of conscience can turn a deaf ear to the voices of suffering . ""
The prime minister was not aiming his criticisms at the UN secretary general , Ban Ki - moon , who warned on Tuesday that the security council 's failure to act on Syria could lead to "" a regional calamity with global ramifications "" .
British officials said that on the diplomatic level the prime minister had in mind Russia and China , which have blocked attempts by Britain to agree tough UN security council resolutions condemning the regime of Bashar al - Assad .
Tehran has a longstanding alliance with Assad while Britain recently stopped a Russian ship carrying helicopters to Syria by cancelling its insurance .
The prime minister , who called for the removal of Assad , said that his defenders were wrong to blame the Arab spring for the bloodshed . ""
Those who look at Syria today and blame the Arab spring have got it the wrong way round .
You can not blame the people for the behaviour of a brutal dictator .
The responsibility lies with the dictator . ""
He said people who invested great hope in the Arab spring were also wrong to give up even in light of the bloodshed in Syria and the political uncertainty after the election of Islamist leaders in countries such as Egypt .
Libya showed the mixed picture , the prime minister said , as he condemned the murder of the US ambassador Chris Stephens in a "" despicable act of terrorism "" while hailing elections to a new congress .
The prime minister said : "" One year on , some believe that the Arab spring is in danger of becoming an Arab winter .
They point to the riots on the streets , Syria 's descent into a bloody civil war , the frustration at the lack of economic progress and the emergence of newly elected Islamist - led governments across the region . ""
But they are in danger of drawing the wrong conclusion .
Today is not the time to turn back , but to keep the faith and redouble our support for open societies , and for people 's demands for a job and a voice . ""
Cameron won important support when Mohamed Morsi , the new Egyptian president , agreed with him on the need to step up pressure on China and Russia to secure a new UN security council resolution on Syria .
In their first meeting Morsi told Cameron a new resolution should focus on sanctions , with the aim of isolating the Assad regime , because military action would worsen the crisis .
Cameron , who held his first meeting in New York with Morsi , believes that the performance of the first elected leader of the world 's largest Arab country shows the progress made in the Arab spring .
Morsi upset Iran when he used an appearance at the non - aligned conference in Tehran to criticise Ahmadinejad for taking the wrong side in Syria .
The prime minister used the example of Morsi to criticise former world leaders who wrongly tolerated dictators on the grounds that they guaranteed stability .
"" The fact is that for decades , too many were prepared to tolerate dictators like Gaddafi and Assad on the basis that they would both keep their people safe at home and promote stability in the region and the wider world .
In fact , neither was true .
Not only were these dictators repressing their people , ruling by control not by consent , plundering the national wealth and denying people their basic rights and freedoms , they were funding terrorism overseas as well . ""
Cameron did not name any former leaders .
But Tony Blair embraced Muammar Gaddafi when he abandoned Libya 's programme of weapons of mass destruction and was humiliated by Assad when he tried to reach out to Damascus in the wake of the 9/11 attacks .
In a dig at Blair and George W Bush , who had hoped that removing Saddam Hussein would unleash a new democratic Iraq , Cameron said his own approach was not "" naive "" .
He said : "" I am not naive in believing that democracy alone has some magical healing power .
I am a liberal Conservative , not a neoconservative . ""
The prime minister 's tough language on Syria reflects Britain 's exasperation with China and Russia , which are using their vetoes as permanent members of the UN security council to block new resolutions .
Britain believes there is no hope of Moscow and Beijing giving any ground at the moment .
Officials talk of a "" logjam "" because the process launched by Kofi Annan , the former UN secretary general , has failed .
The prime minister believes there are two parallel processes under way in Syria – moves , led by the likes of Annan , to encourage a political transition at the top and a bloody revolution bubbling from below that will take some time to lead to a political transition at the top .
Cameron would like the security council to agree to a new resolution under chapter seven of the UN charter , which authorises the use of force .
This would provide legal authority for non - military intervention in Syria and could provide legal cover for military intervention at a later stage .
The prime minister believes that , in the highly unlikely event of a new security council resolution , military action would be unrealistic .
No - fly zones and safe zones would involve military force that could not be delivered .
In his speech the prime minster announced that Britain was to provide £ 3 m for a Unicef fund to help 500,000 refugees in Syria , more than half of whom are children , as winter approaches ."
2012-09-27,"Judicial officials in Iran have jailed the press adviser to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and issued an arrest warrant for the managing director of Shargh , a reformist newspaper shut down over a cartoon deemed insulting .
Ali Akbar Javanfekr , a close ally of the Iranian president and the head of the state Irna news agency , was taken to prison on Wednesday to serve a six - month prison term as Ahmadinejad was addressing the UN general assembly in New York , local agencies reported .
The president 's top aide was put on trial last year as the publisher of "" materials contrary to Islamic norms "" , a reference to a series of articles about the chador , the full - length cloak worn by Iranian women .
The judiciary 's move against Javanfekr is seen as the latest setback for Ahmadinejad and his team in an extraordinary power struggle at the top of the Iranian regime between conservatives close to the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and those supporting the president .
Previous attempts to arrest Javanfekr had failed owing to what is believed to be Ahmadinejad 's protection .
Last November , the authorities raided the daily government newspaper Iran and tried to force their way into the offices to arrest Javanfekr while he was conducting a press conference .
But direct intervention from the president prevented his arrest .
Ahmadinejad 's presence in New York is believed to have paved the way for Javanfekr 's jailing .
The controversy over Javanfekr is linked to the publication of an article in the Iran daily newspaper in which a former Ahmadinejad media adviser , Mehdi Kalhor , criticised the chadors , saying they did not originate from Persian culture but rather were imported from the west .
Analysts , however , link the arrest to the confrontation between Ahmadinejad 's inner circle , including Javanfekr , and their conservative rivals in parliament and the judiciary .
Ahmadinejad 's allies , such as his controversial chief of staff and close confidant , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , are accused of attempting to undermine clerical power , especially Khamenei 's supremacy , and favouring cultural openness and nationalism .
Meanwhile , the authorities closed down the reformist daily Shargh on Wednesday for publishing a cartoon that hardliners suspect mocked the Iranian soldiers who fought the eight - year war between Iran and Iraq in the 1980s .
Hadi Heidari , a leading cartoonist , is reported to have been summoned for questioning over his drawing of a queue of men following each other wearing blindfolds .
Hardliners took offence , claiming the cartoon mocked Iran 's martyrs and former soldiers with what they said was its reference to the headbands worn by Iranian fighters .
On Wednesday conservatives and , in particular , the semi - official Fars news agency , which is affiliated to the elite revolutionary guards , started a campaign against Shargh , calling on the authorities to close it down .
MPs were reported to have signed a petition against the newspaper and the minister for culture and Islamic guidance , Mohammad Hosseini , stepped into the controversy by saying the cartoon "" insulted the values of the revolution "" .
A warrant for the arrest of Shargh 's managing director , Mehdi Rahmanian , has been issued and local agencies reported that he was due to be taken to Evin prison in Tehran .
It is not the first time that Shargh has fallen foul of the Iranian authorities for publishing a cartoon and the daily has been shut down numerous times over recent years .
Many of Shargh 's journalists have also been subjected to state intimidation and arrest in recent years .
Earlier this year , another Iranian cartoonist , Mahmoud Shokraye , was sentenced to 25 lashes for a caricature of a local MP but widespread condemnation of his conviction forced the MP to withdraw his complaint ."
2012-09-28,"So the white , rural gun - toting conspiracy theorists were right .
Put a secret Muslim president in the White House and next thing you know America 's in bed with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Except , according to Tehran 's Fars news agency , it is white rural Americans who are big fans of the Iranian president .
They like him much more than Barack Obama .
In an article which has now been removed from the Fars feed , the news agency reported that 77 % of rural white US voters said they 'd rather have a beer or go to a baseball game with the anti - Semitic Iranian leader than their own president .
"" I like him better , "" Fars reported West Virginia resident Dale Swiderski as saying .
"" He takes national defense seriously , and he 'd never let some gay protesters tell him how to run his country like Obama does . ""
Fars also reported that according to the same Gallup poll , 60 % of rural whites said they at least respected that Ahmadinejad does n't try to hide the fact that he 's Muslim .
Fars does n't say where it got its story
but it seems to have missed out the equally exciting reports alongside the original :
"" George W Bush Returns To America
After Spending 4 Years In The Himalayas "" , "" Neil Armstrong 's Wife Glad
To Finally Get Rid Of All The Space Hobby Crap "" and "" DC Residents Can Remember Exactly Who They Were Murdering When Nationals Clinched First Ever Playoff Berth "" .
For the Fars report is almost word for word copied from the satirical magazine The Onion .
But then , if you 're sitting in Tehran reporting the pronouncements of the Holocaust - denying Iranian leadership , George Bush hiding in the Himalayas may not seem so far - fetched ."
2012-10-01,"' Help , help , help ! ""
screams a cartoon Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , dropping his watering can and running for dear life as a giant dollar sign totters alarmingly and threatens to crush him .
Attacks like these are multiplying as criticism mounts over the mismanagement of Iran 's worsening economic plight .
With the rial plummeting against the dollar , accusations that the president is deliberately manipulating Iran 's foreign currency reserves – hence the watering can – reflect discontent among ordinary people who can no longer afford staple foods or find decent jobs .
Ahmadinejad has been mired in controversy from his election in 2005 , a populist figure who has been both publicly backed and privately vilified by the Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and the Islamic republic 's hardline clerical establishment .
Only last week , as Ahmadinejad was addressing the UN general assembly , his own media adviser was arrested .
He also faced angry criticism over the 140-strong entourage that accompanied him to the UN .
But his speech in New York lacked the familiar fireworks , and an interview with one US newspaper sounded almost conciliatory on the burning question of Iran 's nuclear programme – the reason for some of the toughest international sanctions ever imposed .
Economists agree that the currency crisis has been triggered by financial sanctions which , on top of a huge reduction in oil revenues from the EU , make it harder for Iran to carry on injecting petrodollars into markets to keep exchange rates down .
"" What is making it worse is that the country is plagued by a power struggle between Ahmadinejad and Khamenei , "" says one Iranian analyst , "" so instead of handling the crisis the president is preoccupied by the arrest of his press adviser and the central bank seems completely undecided and shifts from one policy to another . ""
Ahmadinejad , banned from standing for a third term , is widely seen as yesterday 's man .
Mir - Hossein Mousavi , who claimed victory in 2009 , remains under house arrest .
In March 's majlis elections , Khamenei loyalists swept the board .
The president has severe image problems in the west , especially when he excoriates "" Zionists "" or hails the "" hidden imam "" of Shia Muslim tradition , but he has been more pragmatic than Khamenei on the need to ease tensions with the west .
No surprise that he is at loggerheads with the Revolutionary Guards , who seem to welcome an attack by Israel or the US .
Western governments appear to be hoping that the sanctions will encourage popular unrest and a policy shift .
But repression has been successful – far more than in Syria – and there seems little appetite for mass protests .
Media outlets have been officially ordered to avoid "" bleak "" reporting about the economy and to robustly defend the Islamic Revolution . ""
What is happening now is that anyone who is unhappy with the economy and resorts to protests can be easily labelled as damaging national security , "" warns a veteran Tehran - watcher . ""
So this tactic by the big powers of encouraging a popular uprising effectively forces Iranians to shut up . ""
Ali Ansari of the University of St Andrews argues that the Iranian government has now lost all credibility on economic management with its people , not least because there are no independent means of accounting and auditing . ""
Iranian politicians have been quite lucky – especially Ahmadinejad , "" he says .
"" But all of a sudden there are no more miracles around the corner – unless you think that the hidden imam is about to come . """
2012-10-02,"In the Washington Post today , Richard Cohen expresses surprise that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is "" starting to make some sense "" and "" wax rationally "" .
Cohen specifically cites this statement from the Iranian president last week : "" Let 's even imagine that we have an atomic weapon , a nuclear weapon .
What would we do with it ?
What intelligent person would fight 5,000 American bombs with one bomb ? ""
Cohen 's surprise notwithstanding , numerous Iranian leaders , including Ahmadinejad , have long made the same point .
And it 's a point so obvious it should not even need to be made .
No rational person takes seriously the claim that Iran , even if it did obtain a nuclear weapon , would commit instant and guaranteed national suicide by using it to attack a nation that has a huge nuclear stockpile , which happens to include both the US and Israel .
One can locate nothing in the actions of Iran 's regime that even suggests irrationality on that level , let alone suicidal impulses .
That Iran will use its nuclear weapons against the US and Israel is rather obviously the centerpiece of the fear - mongering campaign against Tehran , to build popular support for threats to launch an aggressive attack in order to prevent them from acquiring that weapon .
So what , then , is the real reason that so many people in both the US and Israeli governments are so desperate to stop Iranian proliferation ?
Every now and then , they reveal the real reason : Iranian nuclear weapons would prevent the US from attacking Iran at will , and that is what is intolerable .
The latest person to unwittingly reveal the real reason for viewing an Iranian nuclear capacity as unacceptable was GOP Senator Lindsey Graham , one of the US 's most reliable and bloodthirsty warmongers .
On Monday , Graham spoke in North Augusta , South Carolina , and was asked about the way in which sanctions were harming ordinary Iranians .
Ayman Hossam Fadel was present and recorded the exchange .
Answering that question , Graham praised President Obama for threatening Iran with war over nuclear weapons , decreed that "" the Iranian people should be willing to suffer now for a better future , "" and
then – invoking the trite neocon script that is hauled out whenever new wars are being justified – analogized Iranian nukes to Hitler in the 1930s .
But in the middle of his answer , he explained the real reason Iranian nuclear weapons should be feared : "" They have two goals : one , regime survival .
The best way for the regime surviving , in their mind , is having a nuclear weapon , because when you have a nuclear weapon , nobody attacks you . ""
Graham added that the second regime goal is "" influence "" , that "" people listen to you "" when you have a nuclear weapon .
In other words , we can not let Iran acquire nuclear weapons because if they get them , we can no longer attack them when we want to and can no longer bully them in their own region .
Graham 's answer is consistent with what various American policy elites have said over the years about America 's enemies generally and Iran specifically : the true threat of nuclear proliferation is that it can deter American aggression .
Thomas Donnelly of the American Enterprise Institute and the New American Century Project has long been crystal clear that this is the real reason for opposing Iranian nuclear capability [ my emphasis ] :
"" When their missiles are tipped with warheads carrying nuclear , biological , or chemical weapons , even weak regional powers have a credible deterrent regardless of the balance of conventional forces …
In the post cold war era , America and its allies , rather than the Soviet Union , have become the primary objects of deterrence and it is states like Iraq , Iran and North Korea who most wish to develop deterrent capabilities . ""
He added : "" The surest deterrent to American action is a functioning nuclear arsenal … "" To be sure , the prospect of a nuclear Iran is a nightmare .
But it is less a nightmare because of the high likelihood that Tehran would employ its weapons or pass them on to terrorist groups – although that is not beyond the realm of possibility – and more because of the constraining effect it threatens to impose upon US strategy for the greater Middle East .
The danger is that Iran will ' extend ' its deterrence , either directly or de facto , to a variety of states and other actors throughout the region .
This would be an ironic echo of the extended deterrence thought to apply to US allies during the cold war . ""
As Jonathan Schwarz has extensively documented , this is what US policy elites have said over and over .
In 2001 , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld warned : "" Several of these [ small enemy nations ] are intensely hostile to the United States and are arming to deter us from bringing our conventional or nuclear power to bear in a regional crisis . ""
In 2002 , State Department official Philip Zelikow said that if Iraq were permitted to keep its WMDs , "" they now can deter us from attacking them , because they really can retaliate against us . ""
In 2008 , Democratic Senator Chuck Robb and GOP Senator Dan Coates wrote an incredibly hawkish Washington Post op - ed all but demanding an attack on Iran , and wrote : "" [ A]n Islamic Republic of Iran with nuclear weapons capability would be strategically untenable .
It would threaten U.S. national security …
While a nuclear attack is the worst - case scenario , Iran would not need to employ a nuclear arsenal to threaten US interests .
Simply obtaining the ability to quickly assemble a nuclear weapon would effectively give Iran a nuclear deterrent .
"" The No 1 concern of American national security planners appears to be that countries may be able to prevent the US from attacking them at will , whether to change their regimes or achieve other objectives .
In other words , Iranian nuclear weapons could be used to prevent wars – ones started by the US – and that , above all , is what we must fear .
( Graham 's questioner said that she believed Iran was not committed to developing a nuclear weapon , and Graham responded that Israeli leaders had reached the opposite conclusion .
That is simply false . )
Whatever one thinks of Iran , the signal the US has sent to the world is unmistakable : any rational government should acquire nuclear weapons .
The Iranians undoubtedly watched the US treatment of two dictators who gave up their quest for nuclear weapons –
Iraq 's Saddam Hussein and Libya 's Muammar Gaddafi – and drew the only reasoned lesson : the only way a country can protect itself from US attack , other than full - scale obeisance , is to acquire nuclear weapons .
That is precisely why the US and Israel are so eager to ensure they do not ."

2012-10-03,"Hundreds of demonstrators in the Iranian capital clashed with riot police on Wednesday , during protests against the crisis over the country 's currency .
Police used batons and teargas to try to disperse the crowds .
The day after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appealed to the market to restore calm , the Grand Bazaar – the heartbeat of Tehran 's economy – went on strike , with various businesses shutting down and owners gathering in scattered groups chanting anti - government slogans in reaction to the plummeting value of the rial , which has hit an all - time low this week . ""
Mahmoud [ Ahmadinejad ] the traitor … leave politics , "" shouted some protesters , according to witnesses who spoke to the Guardian .
Other slogans were "" Leave Syria alone , instead think of us , "" said opposition website Kaleme.com .
Iran 's alleged financial and military support for the regime of Bashar al - Assad appears to have infuriated protesters in the wake of the country 's worst financial crisis since the Iran - Iraq war in the 1980s .
Angry protesters and foreign exchange dealers were demonstrating near the bazaar in the south of the capital , where many exchange bureaux are located .
"" The Bazaaris shouted ' Allahu Akbar ' [ God is great ] as they closed down their shops in the morning , "" said a witness .
"" It 's impossible to do business in the current situation . ""
Amateur videos posted on YouTube which appeared to have been taken from Wednesday 's protests , showed demonstrators encouraging Bazaaris to close down shops in solidarity .
Security forces were soon sent to quell the protests .
"" They used teargas to disperse demonstrators in Ferdowsi Street and also blocked the streets close to the protests in order to prevent people joining them , "" said another witness , who asked to remain anonymous . ""
Some shop windows in that area have been smashed and dustbins set on fire .
"" A number of demonstrators had been arrested , according to Kaleme .
A bazaar official , Ahmad Karimi Esfahani , denied that the "" turbulences "" were linked to the business owners , claiming said shops were closed for security reasons and not as part of a strike . ""
The bazaar will open tomorrow as normal , "" he told the semi - official Ilna news agency .
A conservative website , Baztab , described the clashes as "" suspicious "" , denying Bazaaris were involved .
The devaluation of the rial and soaring prices of staple goods are the latest signs that western sanctions – targeting the regime 's nuclear programme – and government mismanagement are compounding the country 's economic woes .
On Wednesday , many foreign exchange dealers and bureaux across the country refused to trade dollars and some currency - monitoring websites refused to announce exchange rates .
Some Iranians expressed anger on social networking websites over the national TV blackout of the protests , saying it discussed the European financial crisis with little if any coverage of Tehran 's unrest .
The authorities were also reported to have jammed signals of the BBC 's Persian service as the protest unfolded .
The government has failed to bring the rial under control despite several attempts .
It has lost 57 % of its value in the past three months and 75 % in comparison with the end of last year .
The dollar is now three times stronger than early last year .
The economy minister , Shamseddin Hosseini , said the government planned to "" gather up "" the unofficial currency market in the latest desperate ditch to curb the crisis .
On Tuesday Iranian authorities announced they would send security services to calm the market but Wednesday 's developments appear to show that the move has backfired .
Ahmadinejad was bombarded with questions about the currency crisis on Tuesday as he spoke to reporters in a press conference but the embattled president , who is under fire from his conservative rivals , rejected the suggestion that it was the result of his economic policies or government incompetence .
Instead , he blamed the rial 's slump on his enemies abroad and opponents at home , saying his government was the victim of a "" psychological war "" .
Ahmadinejad acknowledged western sanctions have contributed to the crisis .
An opinion poll posted on a conservative website , Khabaronline.ir , showed that more than 90 % of those participated were not convinced with Ahmadinejad 's responses on Tuesday .
Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , speaking to elites on Wednesday , said the country was under pressure because "" it did not yield to the demands of tyrannies "" .
Iran is one of the world 's largest oil producers and relies on crude sales as the main source of its the foreign currency reserves .
The latest US and EU embargo on the imports of Iranian oil has affected that reserve , sending the rial tailspinning and making the dollar hard to come by .
Commenting on Iran 's currency slump , the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said that sanctions could be "" remedied "" swiftly if Tehran were cooperating with the international community to address the questions about its disputed nuclear programme .
"" They have made their own government decisions - having nothing to do with the sanctions - that have had an impact on the economic conditions inside of the country , "" Clinton told reporters .
"" Of course the sanctions have had an impact as well , but those could be remedied in short order if the Iranian government were willing to work with the P5 + 1 [ the five security council members plus Germany ] and the rest of the international community in a sincere manner , "" she added ."
2012-10-05,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has survived many crises during his seven years in office , both at home and abroad .
But fears over the country 's crumbling economy , which have exposed the extent of internal divisions at the top of the Islamic republic , could signal the beginning of the end .
Ahmadinejad has been left increasingly marginalised as the country 's currency has plummeted , with analysts speculating that he is being used by his former allies as a scapegoat for the regime 's problems .
With the rial reaching an all - time low this week , Ahmadinejad has been roundly rebuffed by his opponents , who blame his government for mismanagement and economic incompetence .
The currency has lost a third of its value in a week , with the dollar now three times stronger against it than early last year .
At a press conference in Tehran this week , Ahmadinejad made a speech which highlighted the power struggle between his supporters and his conservative rivals in the parliament and the judiciary .
The president defended his economic policies and blamed the plummeting value of the rial both on western sanctions and a "" propaganda campaign "" perpetrated by his opponents at home .
Ahmadinejad 's words widened the internal rift , prompting many of his parliamentary rivals – who form an overwhelming majority – to launch the strongest attack on him by regime insiders so far .
Abbas Rajaei , an MP for the central city of Arak , accused the president of "" lying vividly to the people "" , and Kamalodin Pirmoazen , another parliamentarian , said he was inciting discontent among Iranians towards their officials .
The influential MP Ali Motahari , an outspoken critic of Ahmadinejad , has also recently said that the president should not remain in presidential office "" even for another single day "" .
These remarks echoed what the Iranian opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , both currently under house arrest , said in 2009 when Ahmadinejad took office for a second term amid unrest and allegations of fraud .
They are the latest signs that Ahmadinejad , who has suffered a series of setbacks in his ongoing feud with the conservatives , has lost a great deal of his influence in the country – although he is still able to grab headlines abroad .
Last week , while he was addressing the UN general assembly , his media adviser , Ali Akbar Javanfekr , was taken to Tehran 's Evin prison .
Ahmadinejad suggested this week that he wanted to inspect the prison , but authorities signalled that he would not be welcome .
It did not help that Tehran 's Grand Bazaar , the heartbeat of the capital 's economy , also went on strike and hundreds of protesters took to the streets , chanting anti - government slogans that described the president as a traitor "" .
Iranian state TV , which rarely reflects public anger about the regime , reported the closure of the bazaar and the discontent about the devaluation of currency .
Analysts saw it as a sign that pressure is mounting on the president .
Sadegh Zibakalam , a professor of political science at Tehran University , said Ahmadinejad was increasingly becoming a "" lame duck "" .
Zibakalam said Ahmadinejad was being used as a scapegoat by many of the same people who were his supporters in the past . ""
Ahmadinejad 's economic policies are not new .
They have been in place from the beginning .
If there 's a failure , it 's not limited to Ahmadinejad .
The leadership of fundamentalists should be held responsible too . ""
Fundamentalists , who are believed to be close to the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , have accused Ahmadinejad and his allies , including his controversial chief of staff , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , of attempting to undermine clerical power and advocating nationalism and greater cultural openness . ""
Ahmadinejad and Mashaei do n't think they need to obey clerical power .
They both have not been loyal enough to the supreme leader , "" said Zibakalam .
He predicted that Ahmadinejad , who can not run for a third time under Iranian law , would not be able to ensure the election of one of his allies in the 2013 vote .
Hamid Dabashi , a professor of Iranian studies at Columbia University , said that some of the slogans used by protesters this week showed that the crisis was "" much more deep - rooted "" and had wider political implications .
"" Now the endemic factionalism [ in Iran ] will try to ride on this crisis , as the Islamic Republic is gearing up for the next presidential election .
The conservatives will happily blame Ahmadinejad for everything , "" he said .
"" And if [ the former president Mohammad ]
Khatami plays his historic role of warming up the otherwise depleted political energy of the Islamic Republic , they may actually manage to regenerate some political legitimacy for the ruling regime . """
2012-10-22,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has lambasted the country 's judiciary for not allowing him to visit Tehran 's notorious Evin prison , where his media adviser is currently held behind bars .
Ahmadinejad on Monday wrote an unprecedented letter to Sadeq Larijani , the head of the judicial system , protesting that his constitutional right and duty required him to inspect the prison although officials have signalled he would not be welcome .
The letter , published on the president 's government website , disclosed that Larijani had previously dispatched a "" top secret "" communique , warning that the request to visit Evin was not in the best interests of the country .
Evin , situated in the north of the Iranian capital , is home to the country 's many political prisoners as well as some of its most respected human rights activists and journalists , including the prominent lawyer Nasrin Sotodueh .
At the time of the Islamic revolution in 1979 , Iranian revolutionaries who seized Evin vowed to convert it into a museum to show the injustice under the late Shah , unaware that it was soon to be re - opened and used as a notorious prison where thousands of leftwingers were massacred in the 1980s .
"" You have twice insisted that inspecting Evin prison is not in the best interests of the country and you have said that you disapprove of it , "" he wrote . ""
But the constitution does not require any permission or approval from the judiciary for the president in administering his legal duties . ""
Ahmadinejad 's opponents in the parliament and the judiciary have speculated that the president intended to visit Evin in order to highlight the case of his close ally and top aide Ali Akbar Javanfekr , who is serving a six - month prison term there .
Javanfekr was put on trial last year as the publisher of "" materials contrary to Islamic norms "" , a reference to a series of articles about the chador , the full - length cloak worn by Iranian women .
He was arrested in late September while Ahmadinejad was addressing the UN general assembly in New York , a sign that the president 's influence over Iranian politics is dwindling .
In his letter , Ahmadinejad insinuated that his visit was not aimed at meeting Javanfekr but to make sure the law was being justly administered by prison officials .
"" How come that administering the constitution is not in the best interests of the country ? "" he asked .
"" If that kind of view prevails in the judiciary , ca n't we assume that some of the constitutional laws and basic human rights are being violated or neglected – or sacrificed for the best interests of individuals in the judiciary ? ""
In a situation where the president , who is the representative of the people and administrator of the law , is being so easily accused by you , how can people of this country , who have no supporter except God , make sure they have judicial security ? ""
In recent years , Evin has also been frequented by many people who are or were working for the regime , including the son and daughter of the former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , who were arrested in September .
In Evin , Javanfekr and a number of the president 's allies are kept not far from many opposition protesters who were arrested in the aftermath of the country 's 2009 disputed presidential election which saw Ahmadinejad taking the office for a second term amid unrest and allegations of fraud .
It is the first time Ahmadinejad has used such a strongly worded statement against the country 's judiciary , which is one of Iran 's main political institutions along with the parliament and the presidency .
Some activists said it was hypocritical of Ahmadinejad not to have requested such a visit in 2009 , amid allegations that prisoners faced torture .
However , Ali Motahari , an influential MP and an outspoken critic of the president , said that he should be allowed to inspect Evin , urging him to meet other prisoners , too .
On Sunday , Iran 's prosecutor general , Gholam - Hossein Mohseni - Ejei , embarrassed Ahmadinejad in public by saying that he could not go to Evin .
"" We must pay attention to major issues …
Visiting a prison in these circumstances is a minor issue , "" he said , according to the semi - official Mehr news agency .
"" If we have in mind the best interests of the nation , a [ prison ] visit in these circumstances is not appropriate . ""
The row is seen as the latest setback for Ahmadinejad and his team in an extraordinary power struggle at the top of the Iranian regime between conservatives close to the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and those supporting the president .
In light of the setbacks , Ahmadinejad has lost a great deal of his influence , becoming increasingly marginalised , with analysts speculating that he is being used by his former allies as a scapegoat for the regime 's problems ."
2012-11-04,"Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is moaning that missile strikes have n't hit Israel hard enough .
The Americans say they support Israel 's military attack on Iran the previous day , but wo n't actively engage in this war .
And the Israelis are counting their country 's civilian deaths and wondering if they should launch a second strike on Iranian nuclear facilities , to "" finish the job "" .
This is all part of a war simulation game staged by an Israeli thinktank last month , to which a British film crew were given sole access .
The result is a game - time enactment of what would happen if Israel does attack Iran .
For some time , Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu has been escalating talk of a military strike , to prevent Iran from building its first nuclear weapon .
The prospect of war , and recent disaster drills to prepare for it , have terrified his own people , and the rest of the world .
Israeli military and intelligence chiefs say a strike is a bad idea , while the Obama administration has told Israel to back off and wait for sanctions to work .
If Israel hit Iran 's nuclear facilities , would Hezbollah , Iran 's allies in Lebanon , join in to retaliate ?
Would America step in to help its best friend in the Middle East ?
This filmed simulation shows a group of Israeli ex - spooks , former politicians and military officials split into teams to role - play the consequences .
I have not seen the full film , but was in the cutting room for a couple of days helping with translation and the scenes I saw were compelling .
Team Israel , taking stock of Iranian missile attacks on civilian targets , makes the operational assumption that the situation wo n't spiral totally out of control .
Is that a reasonable prediction , or totally delusional ?
The documentary has an interview with an Iranian former nuclear negotiator and foreign policy adviser , who returns the simulated salvo by saying that Israel has grossly underestimated Iran 's capacity for retaliation .
Iran , he says , would assume American complicity in any Israeli attack and take aim at US targets in the Middle East .
When the US staged their own simulation of this same situation , in March , it predicted that an Israeli strike would lead to a wider regional war .
Now , the UK is thinking about putting warplanes in the Persian Gulf as tensions rise .
And American military commanders have warned Israel that an attack on Iran could stunt US action , by cutting off key logistics support from Gulf countries that host US bases .
Watching scenes from Nuclear War Games , the bit that struck me most was a clip in which the Israeli role - players , having achieved their attack goals , are talking about a UN resolution – wondering if they should launch a final strike before ceasefire , and whether the US can be persuaded to make the resolution state "" regret "" rather than "" condemnation "" over Israel 's actions .
Listening in , you ca n't help feeling that this conversation has played out before – in real wars ; in real life .

2013-01-10,"Six months ahead of a vote that will end to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's contentious presidency , talk of elections has already prompted top - level controversies in Tehran .
This week , Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , asked officials not to make statements insinuating that previous elections were not free .
The 73-year - old was speaking to a group of devout crowds from the holy city of Qom .
In his speech , Khamenei criticised senior politicians who have indirectly cast doubt on the fairness of Iran 's electoral record .
The Islamic republic does not tolerate criticism of its election process and the two main opposition leaders who claimed the 2009 presidential vote was rigged , Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , were put under house arrest .
Officials critical of the election process , therefore , tend to express misgivings opaquely .
In recent months , a number of leading figures have said the presidential election in June would only be competitive and lively if it were to be held "" freely "" .
Among the officials who are believed to be the target of Khamenei 's stern warning is Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , a former president and one of the country 's great political survivors .
He presides over Iran 's expediency council which mediates between the parliament and the guardian council , a body of clerics and jurists that vets candidates before any election .
In September , as public debate over the impact of international sanctions on Iran 's economy escalated , Rafsanjani said holding "" free elections "" would bring the country out of its current stalemate and avert threats of war that have been looming over the Islamic republic . ""
Holding elections that are free , transparent and in compliance with the constitution will solve a big part of the country 's problems , "" he said .
His comments have been echoed by other leading figures including the former reformist president Mohammad Khatami who have previously said that "" free elections "" would prevent international threats facing Iran .
In what is believed to be a response to remarks made by the likes of Rafanjani and Khatami , Khamenei said this week : "" They should not discourage the nation , they should not insist on saying that elections are not free . ""
He warned the public against making "" general recommendations "" that would "" serve the purpose of the enemy "" , adding : "" We 've held more than 30 elections since the [ 1979 ] Islamic revolution , which one was not free ?
In which country you can see elections freer than those held in Iran ? ""
Following the address , his representative in the Revolutionary Guards , Ali Saeedi , said the elite military force had "" a responsibility to engineer a rational and logical elections "" .
That triggered an immediate response by many Iranians on social networking websites who interpreted it as a sign of the guards ' interference in the upcoming elections .
The Revolutionary Guards soon attempted to clarify Saeedi 's remarks by saying he did not mean it would intervene but many critics , including Ahmadinejad , were not convinced .
"" Anyone who wants to direct Iranian people , Iranian people would direct him , "" an infuriated president said .
Back in 2005 , the Revolutionary Guards were among the staunch supporters of Ahmadinejad .
But internal divisions between the president and the supreme leader during his second term in office have created a wide gap between Ahmadinejad and his erstwhile patrons .
As sanctions have taken toll on Iran 's crumbing economy , he and the Revolutionary Guards have been engaged in a blame game , each trying to highlight the failures of the other side ."
2013-02-27,"One of the perennial glories of British journalism is the capacity to take old news and give it new life by discovering it all over again .
Such was the case on the front page of today 's Daily Telegraph , which claims to have found that "" Iran has activated the Arak heavy - water production plant "" that in fact started operations in 2004 , and was formally opened by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2006 .
Exhibit A in the Telegraph story is a satellite photo with a red ring superimposed on the middle which purports to show some steam escaping .
It reports : Western governments and the IAEA [ International Atomic Energy Agency ] have held information about activity at Arak for some time .
But today 's exclusive images are the first to put evidence of that activity into the public domain .
That is a pretty bold claim , given the wealth of reporting about the site over the years , since the existence of the Arak heavy water project was first reported in 2002 .
The picture above , dated October 2004 , has some much better steam .
The latest IAEA report on the Iranian programme , published earlier this month notes that "" Based on recent images , the plant appears to continue to be in operation .
"" This is what Olli Heinonen , the IAEA 's former chief inspector had to say : I really do not find news in this article .
As repeatedly pointed out in the IAEA reports , the heavy water plant has been operational during last few years .
The IAEA has used satellite imagery to confirm the operational status , but one can not conclude from those images the amount of heavy water produced .
The Telegraph report says the IAEA has not been able to visit the site since 2011 , but the Arak plant is not covered by Iran 's safeguard 's agreement .
It does not produce radioactive material but heavy water ( deuterium oxide , like water but with a heavier concentration of a certain hydrogen isotope , deuterium ) .
That which will be used to moderate uranium fission in a reactor under construction nearby , which is being visited by IAEA inspectors .
Spent fuel from the reactor could then be reprocessed to produce plutonium , which can in turn be used to make smaller , more powerful nuclear warheads than highly enriched uranium .
Hence the proliferation concern , but Iran is a long way from that point .
The Arak reactor is due to be ready next year , but some experts , including Heinonen , have doubts it will be operational on time .
IR-40 needs up to 90 tons of heavy water for the first load .
My Iranian sources tell me that they might still be short of that .
Mr. Abbasi Davani [ the head of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organisation ] has recently stated that the reactor will start operation in early 2014 , which might be optimistic in light of the heavy water production rate , and the fact that the actual fuel manufacturing has not yet started in Isfahan .
Isfahan has so far converted uranium , produced pellets , but only a prototype fuel element has been manufactured .
The new IAEA report notes that "" the installation of cooling and moderator circuit piping was almost complete "" at the Arak reactor , and that a prototype fuel assembly intended for the reactor was being subject to irradiation testing at the Tehran Research Reactor .
As Iran continues to move forward with the Arak reactor , in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions , there will inevitably be greater scrutiny of a possible plutonium route to a bomb .
Mark Fitzpatrick of the International Institute of Strategies Studies said : Iran has successfully moved the goalposts so that all we talk about is 20%-enriched uranium , taking attention away from all the other worrying things it is doing .
However , even if and when the Arak reactor starts working , the possible plutonium route to an Iranian bomb will far less immediate than the uranium route , as David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security points out : They would have to get the reactor to work and they would have to irradiate the fuel and then they would have to break their promise not to reprocess , which would be an enormous step , and then they would have to build the reprocessing plant .
Meanwhile , all the necessary material and machinery for making a uranium warhead is in place , should Iran make the decision it wants to make a bomb , and more of that machinery is being installed all the time .
Hence the focus on the uranium route .
The plutonium option hovers in the background , and will loom larger in the coming months , but it is not the imminent threat that blurry satellite pictures imply ."
2013-03-06,"Hugo Chávez 's foreign allies have paid tribute to the Venezuelan president , who died on Tuesday after a long battle with cancer , praising him as a champion of liberation and promising that his influence would live on .
Some even joined Venezuela in announcing mourning periods for the charismatic leader , who divided opinion abroad with his scathing criticism of the US and friendships with countries ostracised by the west .
The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , said Chávez would "" return on resurrection day "" .
He said he had "" no doubt that Chávez will return to Earth "" along with Jesus and Imam Mahdi , the most revered figure among Shia Muslims , to help "" establish peace , justice and kindness "" in the world .
Announcing a day of mourning , Ahmadinejad also said he believed something "" suspicious "" caused Chávez 's cancer .
In Syria , where civil war has claimed an estimated 70,000 lives over the past two years , there was gratitude for Chávez 's unstinting support in the face of western hostility .
The state news agency , Sana , praised Chávez 's "" honourable stance towards the conspiracy against Syria as he announced repeatedly his solidarity with the Syrian leadership and people in the face of the heinous imperialistic campaign hatched against it "" .
There was also praise from other members of the Latin American left , for whom Chávez was an inspirational leader .
Rafael Correa , president of Ecuador and one of Chávez 's closest allies , said : "" We have lost a revolutionary , but millions of us remain inspired . ""
The Bolivian president , Evo Morales , another of the Venezuelan president 's most loyal disciples , was teary - eyed and declared : "" Chávez is more alive than ever . ""
"" Chávez will continue to be an inspiration for all peoples who fight for their liberation , "" Morales said in a televised speech .
There was a similar tribute from Nicaragua , a nation that broadly benefited from cut - price Venezuelan oil .
Rosario Murillo , the wife and spokeswoman of the president , Daniel Ortega , said Chávez was "" one of the dead who never die "" .
In Cuba , President Raúl Castro 's government declared two days of national mourning and ordered the flag to fly at half - mast , declaring its "" deep and excruciating sorrow "" at the news and describing him as "" one of their most outstanding sons "" .
The Argentinian president , Cristina Fernández de Kirchner , declared three days of mourning .
The Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Chávez was "" a great leader "" , while Russia 's UN ambassador , Vitaly Churkin , called his death a tragedy .
There was a predictably less effusive response from the US , where the president , Barack Obama , issued a statement reaffirming Washington 's support for the "" Venezuelan people and its interest in developing a constructive relationship with the Venezuelan government "" , while citing its commitment "" to policies that promote democratic principles , the rule of law , and respect for human rights "" .
Many US allies followed his lead .
The Canadian prime minister , Stephen Harper , and German foreign minister , Guido Westerwelle , both referred to freedom and democracy as keys to unlocking Venezuela 's future potential .
The British foreign secretary , William Hague , said he was saddened by Chávez 's death but offered a neutral assessment of his leadership , remarking merely that he had "" left a lasting impression on the country and more widely "" .
Another US ally , France , deviated from the script somewhat .
The socialist president , François Hollande , noted that "" not everyone shared "" his political views but praised Chávez 's "" undeniable will to fight for justice and development "" ."
2013-03-07,"Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has been criticised for saying that Hugo Chávez will be resurrected along with Jesus Christ in his tribute to the Venezuelan president who died on Tuesday .
Ahmad Khatami , an influential cleric in the country 's assembly of experts , said on Wednesday that Ahmadinejad went "" too far "" with his claim that Chávez would "" return on resurrection day "" .
"" I say directly that he went too far with what he mentioned in his tribute , "" said Khatami , who is a Tehran Friday prayer leader and a close ally of Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
"" The president is well aware that such a tribute will provoke reactions in our religious institutes …
He could have sent a diplomatic message with no religious connotations . ""
On Wednesday , the Iranian cabinet declared a day of national mourning , and Ahmadinejad wrote a letter of condolence addressed to Venezuela 's interim president , Nicolás Maduro . ""
Chávez is alive , as long as justice , love and freedom are living .
He is alive , as long as piety , brightness , and humanity are living , "" he wrote , according to the English translation of the letter published by the semi - official Mehr news agency . ""
He is alive , as long as nations are alive and struggle for consolidating independence , justice and kindness .
I have no doubt that he will come back , and along with Christ the Saviour , the heir to all saintly and perfect men , and will bring peace , justice and perfection for all . ""
The president did not name Imam Mahdi , the revered saviour of Shia Islam , in his tribute , but by naming Christ he made clear that Chávez would also be among the Imam 's allies .
The reappearance of Mahdi is anticipated by believers in a manner comparable to that with which Christians anticipate the second coming of Jesus .
Shia Muslims believe both will come on the resurrection day . ""
Hugo Chávez was a name known to all nations .
His name is reminiscent of pure innocence , kindness , fortitude and love for the people , to serve the people , especially the poor and the victims of colonialism and imperialism by arrogant powers , "" he wrote .
"" He is indeed a martyr of the road to service to Venezuelan people , and preserving human and revolutionary values . ""
Other religious figures in Iran have also echoed Khatami 's criticism of Ahmadinejad 's remarks about Chávez , one of his closest allies .
Hossein Rouhaninejad of Iran 's Islamic development organisation said the president 's remarks were against Shia Islam beliefs .
Another senior cleric , Seyed Mahdi Tabatabaei , chastised Ahmadinejad for "" wrong moves "" , saying his comments were "" legally and religiously wrong "" ."
2013-03-07,"The Iranian authorities have arrested two journalists and banned three reformist publications , reports the Associated Press .
A report by semi - official ISNA news agency says agents from the Tehran prosecutor 's office detained two executives working for the reformist daily title , Maghreb - managing editor Mohammad Mahdi Emami Nasseri and political editor Ali Reza Aghaeirad .
Their arrests were linked to last month 's publication of an article that criticised the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
ISNA also quoted politician Ali Motahari as saying that the prosecutor 's office has banned three reformist periodicals — the monthlies Mehrnameh and Tajrobeh , and the weekly Asseman .
In recent months Iran has escalated its press crackdown , arresting dozens of journalists for alleged cooperation with foreign - based Persian - language media organisations .
It is also reported that these moves should be seen in the context of rivalries among political factions ahead of June 's presidential election .

2013-03-13,"When millions across the world used the phrase "" Arab spring "" to describe pro - democracy movements in the Middle East , Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , made it clear he disapproved .
Instead , he referred to those events as the Islamic awakening , with the intention of keeping a political uprising from crossing the borders into the Islamic republic .
But to the ayatollah 's dismay Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is increasingly using the word "" spring "" in what appears to be a campaign slogan for the man many believe he has chosen as his candidate in the forthcoming presidential race .
The president 's speech at the UN general assembly in September 2012 was the first time he is known to have used what has now become his pet phrase , causing internal disputes and anger among his conservative rivals . ""
Long live this spring , long live this spring and long live this spring , "" he said at the UN podium in what was perceived to be one of his mildest public addresses during his seven years in office .
The president has since repeated similar lines several times .
It has become common to hear Ahmadinejad publicly using the word .
After a cabinet meeting on Wednesday , when a reporter asked if he had any news for people , he replied : "" What is a better and prettier news than the fact that spring is coming .
The time of sorrow is going away and , God willing , the next year will be a good and successful year for all Iranians . ""
March 20 , marking the spring equinox , is the start of the Persian new year –
Nowruz – a 13-day ancient Zoroastrian festival celebrated as the most important holiday of the Iranian calendar .
The presidential elections , scheduled for 14 June , are taking place in the final days of the season .
Ahmadinejad 's critics believe the president , who is prevented under Iranian law from running for a third term , is pursuing a Putin / Medvedev - style reshuffle by grooming his chief of staff , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , as his possible successor .
Mashaei , a confidant of Ahmadinejad and his relative , is accused of advocating nationalism , greater cultural openness and attempting to undermine clerical rule , especially the supremacy of Khamenei .
Opponents say that Mashaei is the head of a "" deviant current "" within the president 's inner circle and he has little respect for the supreme leader , although he denies it .
If Mashaei does put his name forward for the presidential vote , the powerful pro - Khamenei Guardian Council will have to vet his candidacy .
Many believe he will not be allowed to run , while others say Ahmadinejad will threaten to go out with all guns firing if that happens .
Last week , in a ceremony held before Nowruz , Ahmadinejad awarded Mashaei the country 's highest cultural medal .
Both men were recorded as using spring in their speeches .
Keyhan , an ultra - conservative newspaper with a director appointed by Khamenei , has attacked the men for repeated references to spring , which it said could have un - Islamic connotations .
Senior figures associated with the elite revolutionary guards have also voiced criticism of Ahmadinejad 's catchphrase .
Mohammad Esmail Kowsari , an MP , has warned that the president might be accused of engineering the elections .
Another MP , Mohammad Hassan Asafari , said "" long live the spring "" was used by the "" deviants "" .
In response to the criticism , Ahmadinejad has said the use of spring merely referred to the revered Shia figure hidden Imam Mahdi .
Meanwhile , local newspapers reported that Tehran 's municipality has banned the word spring from being used in billboards across the Iranian capital .
Some analysts say that Ahmadinejad is trying to attract the popular vote by creating his own version of an Iranian spring that is aimed at highlighting nationalism .
By infuriating the establishment , some say , in fact Ahmadinejad is intending to draw attention from voters sympathetic to the Iranian opposition and reformers .
Ahmadinejad has also been recently accused of a series of "" inappropriate "" and "" un - Islamic "" behaviours , such as saying that Hugo Chávez will be resurrected with Jesus and embracing the mother of the former Venezuelan president at his funeral , which , some believe , could have been an intentional move in order to showcase openness ."
2013-03-13,"With all candidates to be vetted by authorities and an opposition boycott on the cards , one of the most important battles in the upcoming Iranian presidential election is likely to be about turnout .
The country 's leaders need significant participation in June to secure legitimacy , which was gravely undermined after the previous presidential vote and its bloody aftermath four years ago when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was re - elected over his reformist challenger , Mir Hossein Mousavi , in a vote that many Iranians believe was manipulated .
Mousavi , his wife , the artist Zahra Rahnavard , and the former parliament speaker Mehdi Karroubi , who also campaigned for the presidency as a reformist , have been under house arrest since 2011 , a response to large - scale pro - democracy demonstrations .
Their supporters have called for a boycott of elections , saying all pro - democracy activists must be released as a precondition for participating .
But although voting is not officially compulsory in the Islamic republic , many Iranians feel they will be penalised if they do not .
Each voter gets a stamp in their national identification booklet , and there 's a widespread belief that having a stamp is important in the selection process for government positions and for obtaining various professional permits .
As a result , a substantial number of dissatisfied voters show up only to enter blank or illegible ballots .
In parliamentary elections last year so many ballots reportedly had to be discarded that an MP requested an investigation into the matter .
Amir , 26 , who lives in the Monirieh district in south Tehran , described the pressure he felt to vote . ""
The people in my generation are looking for secure work .
In job interviews at governmental and semi - governmental organisations , or even when seeking a permit to start an artistic or public relations office , they look at your national ID booklet to see if you have voted in the elections .
The number of such stamps has a critical bearing on the acceptance of your application file .
So , I have to participate in the elections , even if it means depositing a blank ballot , "" said Amir , who is currently job - hunting after years of studying graphic design .
This year the government is employing a new strategy to boost participation .
For the first time , the presidential contest will be held at the same time as municipal and rural council elections , which prompt intense campaign activity in many areas .
Behrang , a political science student with experience in electoral campaign work , said : "" Combining the two elections is a public relations escape route from the lack - of - confidence crisis , because there is strong competition to capture rural and small city council seats .
Hence , when someone goes to vote for a council member he supports , it is very likely that he will take part in the presidential balloting at the same time . ""
Then there are the economic inducements .
Since December 2011 , when subsidies on many household goods and energy were eliminated or reduced , the government has made direct payments to Iranian families to partly offset the inflationary effects . ""
By making payments in the months close to the elections , and perhaps even boosting the amounts , the government can appease the rural population and entice them to appear at the ballot boxes , "" Behrang said .
Iranians are feeling the effects of economic sanctions , and financial worries are affecting how Iranians view the upcoming election .
Mohammad , 45 , is a semi - skilled labourer at a ceramic tile factory .
He has two children , eight and 13 years old .
"" I sold my two - bedroom home to move to a better district so that I could sign up my kids at better schools , "" he said .
"" The way the prices went up , not only could I not buy a new place , I ended up renting a basement unit in a worse district . ""
He has also had to sell his car , and his wife has started working in a clothing store .
"" I am worried that the factory will close and I will be left unemployed . ""
Scores of Iranian manufacturing operations have shut down in the past year .
Asked whether he would vote , Mohammad said : "" Officials get government - provided housing , they have no phone , water , or electricity bills , they get high salaries with nice benefits .
They are not worried about losing their jobs .
In short , they have no sense of our problems .
Then they want to drag us out to the polling boxes to vote .
All their concerns are politics .
It would be nice if they could be concerned about us a bit too . ""
Dissatisfaction with the leadership is not limited to the working class .
Javid , who holds a degree in chemical engineering , is the project director for a petrochemical contractor in Oslovieh , Iran 's largest onshore petroleum field .
In an interview conducted online , he said : "" Three years ago we had over 3,000 employees , but today only 600 have a job .
The rest were ' right - sized ' , laid off . ""
A month ago , my spouse was one of those laid off .
So we have applied for a US student visa for her so that we can get away from Iran for a few years .
The current conditions are scary and everyone is trapped in a vague sense of anticipation . ""
His wife , Nasrin , added : "" Many of my laid - off co - workers and I see the government , because of its mismanagement of the economy , as the main culprit .
Last time we voted to bring in a new government , change the situation and reform things , but the conditions became even worse … I wo n't repeat the same experience by voting [ this time ] . ""
But some Iranians say they are looking forward to voting .
Ehsan , 30 , has recently married .
By his account , he has been a member of the Basij militia since adolescence .
His father , now retired , served in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps .
According to Ehsan , who works as a driver with a transportation company : "" The critical conditions are due to the breakdown in the global economy .
All countries of the world are in economic crisis ; it is not this government 's fault . """
2013-03-28,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was in jovial mood when he met the Pakistani president , Asif Ali Zardari , and a 300-strong delegation at the Iranian border town of Chabahar earlier this month .
The two men were attending a ceremony to launch construction , on the Pakistani side , of a new pipeline that will funnel natural gas from Iran 's South Pars field in the Gulf to energy - starved Pakistani businesses , car drivers and consumers from the end of 2014 .
For the smiling Ahmadinejad , the £ 5bn pipeline serves several key purposes .
It will produce hard currency for Iran 's hard - pressed economy .
It goes some way to mitigating historical suspicions that have separated Shia Iran and predominantly Sunni Muslim Pakistan .
It boosts Tehran 's regional influence .
But more than that , the pipeline will help break the sanctions stranglehold on Iran 's energy sector imposed by the US and western allies concerned about Tehran 's nuclear - related activities .
"" I 'm confident that no foreign element will be able to affect our historic and brotherly relations , "" the Iranian president said .
The pipeline was a symbol of the two countries ' independence from "" those who only aim to humiliate us , and break us apart , and dominate us ...
With natural gas , you can not make atomic bombs .
That 's why they should have no excuse to oppose this pipeline . ""
The revival of the much - delayed project , and the timing of the high - profile joint ceremony attended by diplomats from Arab states , appears , in part at least , to be the product of canny calculations by Zardari ahead of Pakistan 's national elections on 11 May.
The Pakistani president , whose own five - year term ends in September , wants to be seen to be doing something about chronic energy shortages that bring daily power cuts and caused a nationwide blackout last month .
But by courting Ahmadinejad , Zardari was also sending a pointed signal to the US government .
Pakistan 's long - running , ambivalent relationship with its principal financial backer and strategic ally has been more hate than love in recent times .
Strong anti - American feeling , outraged by the 2011 commando raid that found and killed Osama bin Laden on Pakistani territory and by lethal Afghan border incidents involving Pakistani and American troops , is being stoked on an almost weekly basis by US drone attacks .
US commentators describe the relationship as "" toxic "" .
In this poisonous context , Zardari 's move was seen as a deliberate attempt to emphasise Islamabad 's growing freedom of action as the American regional presence declines with next year 's withdrawal from Afghanistan .
Anthony Skinner , of the British - based Maplecroft risks consultancy , said : "" The Pakistani government wants to show it is willing to take foreign policy decisions that defy the US ...
The pipeline not only caters to Pakistan 's energy needs but also lodged brownie points with the many critics of the US among the electorate . ""
Senior Pakistani officials point to a string of decisions by Zardari designed not only to loosen Washington 's suffocating embrace but also keep India , Pakistan 's major regional rival and sometime foe , at bay .
These include his collaboration with David Cameron and Hamid Karzai , the Afghan president , in a trilateral process on Afghanistan 's future that has excluded Delhi .
The most recent meeting was held at Chequers last month .
Ignoring US and Indian concerns , Zardari has also held out his hand to China , recently transferring management of the highly strategic port of Gwadar from a Singapore company to a Chinese one .
"" China 's presence in the Gwadar port at the mouth of the Arabian Sea will deter India from carrying out any action planned against Pakistan , "" Chinese state media dutifully noted .
All this , coupled with his success in holding Pakistan 's government together , against all the odds , and presiding over what in May will be the first civilian government - to - civilian government democratic transition in the country 's history , has boosted Zardari 's stock , opening the way for a possible bid for a second term . ""
For someone who was not trained as a politician , Zardari has seen everybody off , "" a senior Pakistani official said .
"" He 's got the better of all of them . ""
The Obama administration , meanwhile , looks on balefully , struggling unsuccessfully to conceal its displeasure and resist the temptation to hit back with sanctions .
Victoria Nuland , the state department spokeswoman , said : "" If this deal is finalised for a proposed Iran - Pakistan pipeline , it would raise serious concerns under our Iran Sanctions Act .
We 've made that absolutely clear to our Pakistani counterparts .
"" The US is urging alternative energy solutions on Islamabad , including a notional and , given the security issues involved , rather fanciful plan for a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to India via Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Washington has also offered help with new hydroelectric dams and other projects .
The state department 's Patrick Ventrell said : "" We really think there are other long - term solutions ...
It 's in their best interest to avoid any sanctionable activity . ""
But the senior Pakistani official dismissed such talk as so much hot air . ""
Hillary Clinton came and offered to help us .
But they have n't done anything . """
2013-05-01,"As the countdown begins for elections that will usher in Iran 's first new president in eight years , all eyes are still on Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the unpredictable and mercurial man who looks unlikely to go quietly .
Shortly after the 14 June poll , he will have to relinquish his office in Tehran 's Pastor street and hand over the keys to his successor .
Given the tight timetable for Iranian elections , it is almost impossible to guess who that person will be .
With just six weeks to go , registrations for presidential candidates are only due next week .
A number of hopefuls have already announced plans to run but their candidacies will not be valid until the powerful Guardian Council vets their competence and loyalty to the Islamic republic .
In 2009 , out of 476 registered nominees , only four candidates were allowed to stand – two of them , Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , are under house arrest for refusing to accept the results and for alleging fraud .
The final list of this year 's candidates is expected on 23 May and a three - week campaign period will follow .
Despite this , Ahmadinejad has embarked on an extensive schedule of provincial visits in what is suspected to be part of an election strategy designed to promote his favoured candidate .
On Wednesday , he was visiting Rasht , the capital of north - western Gilan province , situated on the coast of the Caspian Sea .
At the weekend , he went to Tabriz in the East Azerbaijan province .
Previously , he visited a number of other provinces , such as Isfahan , Khuzestan and Semnan .
He is not alone ; other nominees are following his footsteps .
Under Iranian law , the president can not run for a third term but all the signs indicate that the 57-year - old Ahmadinejad , a relatively young politician in the Iranian hierarchy , has no plans for retirement .
On the contrary , he is accused of planning a Putin / Medvedev - style reshuffle by grooming his chief of staff and close confidant , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei .
In the eyes of loyalists to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , today 's Ahmadinejad bears no resemblance to the young revolutionary and later Tehran mayor who rose to become president in 2005 .
Back then , he quickly became the ayatollah 's protege , enjoying an unprecedented influence over Iranian politics .
Now , Ahmadinejad is at odds with his erstwhile patrons in the Revolutionary Guards and widely seen as a lame duck .
Ahmadinejad has fallen foul of the loyalists because of his unwavering support for Mashaei , who is accused of leading a deviant current in the inner circle of the president , loathed for their advocacy of greater cultural openness and nationalism .
Many are already counting down Ahmadinejad 's dying days in office , believing they are his final days in power .
Others think he still has a chance and , in case Mashaei is disqualified from running , is issuing challenges to the establishment by threatening to go out all guns blazing and pulling down the edifice of the political system that championed him .
But who is afraid of Ahmadinejad ?
In February , the president played a secretly filmed tape in the Iranian parliament - to the astonishment of millions of Iranians listening on national radio - that revealed the speaker 's brother was allegedly trading on his sibling 's influence for financial gain .
Many fear that the president 's team have many more secret tapes and videos that could pose serious challenges to the Islamic republic ; others say that is a bluff .
"" They have installed hidden cameras , listening devices in order to collect information and release them in public , "" Mohammed Ali Montazeri , a judicial official , warned this week .
Baztab , a conservative news website critical of the government , said in a report that Ahmadinejad was rumoured to possess a tape that shows he received a phone call from the authorities right after the 2009 elections telling him they planned to announce that he had won millions more votes than the real tally .
This was denied by the president 's office this week and Baztab was taken offline on Wednesday .
"" There are things to say ...
"" Ahmadinejad said on a recent visit to the holy city of Qom , promising to reveal them at a future date .
The president 's menacing language has infuriated his rivals and , as elections approach , everyone is watching for any unexpected movements that may embarrass the supreme leader ."
2013-05-07,"When Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ran for Iran 's presidential office in 2005 , his distinctive white kapshan ( jacket ) became a trademark .
His supporters said it was a sign that the then mayor of Tehran was truly a man of the people ; his critics complained he could be damaging the country 's image with bad fashion .
In his first years as president , Ahmadinejad continued to sport his familiar attire despite complaints .
However , as his position of power became more entrenched , his trademark kapshan became redundant as polyester windbreakers gave way to often oversized tailored suits .
The change did not go unnoticed .
Mostafa Reza - Hosseini Ghotbabadi , a former MP , said : "" Ahmadinejad 's characteristics have changed , his jackets are replaced with formal suits . ""
With a hole under its left arm , the original white jacket was auctioned off two years ago and sold for the equivalent of £ 34,000 .
As Iran braces itself for a six - week election frenzy , a nostalgic Ahmadinejad has once again returned to the kapshan look .
Although the 57-year - old can not run for a third term , he has embarked on an extensive schedule of provincial visits , reportedly as part of a plan to groom his favoured candidate and chief of staff , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , to be his successor .
Meanwhile in Tehran , he appears to be sticking with his suits .
At the closing ceremony of the world conference of Ulama and Islamic awakening last week , Ahmadinejad was wearing an Italian - style dark blue pinstripe suit .
"" At least his suits are getting better , "" tweeted Hooman Majd , the author of The Ayatollah Begs to Differ :
The Paradox of Modern Iran ; posting Ahmadinejad 's picture on the social networking website .
Another user tweeted : "" New stylist ? """
2013-05-07,"Iran started its six - week search for a new president on Tuesday as candidates began to register for an election that will mark the end of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's turbulent period in office .
Dozens of hopefuls from various political groups have put their names forward for June 's presidential poll .
It is the first since the 2009 election , which resulted in months of unrest , bloodshed and the arrest of hundreds of protesters , journalists and political activists .
Local media reported that 62 people took their identity cards and documents to the interior ministry on the first of the five - day registrations to announce their candidacies .
Among them were a handful of serious contenders , including Hassan Rouhani , a former chief nuclear negotiator , Kamran Bagheri Lankarani , a former health minister , and Mostafa Kavakebian , a former MP .
Other big players have yet to step forward for a battle between conservative "" principlists "" , reformists , government associates and independents .
Saeed Jalili , the country 's current chief nuclear negotiator , is also a potential nominee .
Shortly after filing his candidacy , the former nuclear negotiator Rouhani pledged "" constructive interaction with the world "" to try to address concerns about Tehran 's atomic programme .
The interior minister , Mostafa Mohammad - Najjar , who opened the candidate registration on Tuesday via video link , warned the nominees not to violate the rules by launching their campaign before being vetted .
"" The registration continues until 11 May and vetting the qualification of the candidates by the guardian council will start from 12 May , "" he was quoted as saying by the semi - official Fars news agency .
When registration finishes , the guardian council 's powerful group of clergymen and jurists will examine the nominees ' competence and loyalty to the Islamic republic and pick up the final list of this year 's candidates , which is expected on 23 May , in what looks like a very tight election calendar .
A three - week campaign period will follow before the vote on 14 June .
For a large number of Iran 's opposition Green Movement , which was crushed after the 2009 events , this year 's vote has little legitimacy as the opposition leaders , Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , are still under house arrest .
Even so , reformists who were allied with the Green Movement do not appear to have any active plans for a boycott .
In recent weeks , controls and blocks on internet traffic appeared to be boosted in possible attempts to limit opposition voices during the election period .
Rouhani and Kavakebian are both reformist candidates , but it is still unclear whether more high - profile figures such as former president Mohammad Khatami or the moderate Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani will run .
Rafsanjani has hinted this week that he would be willing to run if the supreme leader , Khamenei , approved his decision .
"" I will not enter the field without [ Khamenei 's ] consent , "" he said , according to the semi - official Mehr news agency .
Khamenei 's supporters have criticised Rafsanjani , saying he sided with the Green Movement after the 2009 elections that gave Ahmadinejad a second term in office .
Under Iranian law , Ahmadinejad can not run for a third term but he is widely suspected to be grooming his close confidant and chief of staff , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , as a possible successor as part of a plan for a Putin / Medvedev - style reshuffle .
In recent weeks , Mashaei , whose daughter is married to Ahmadinejad 's son , has been accompanying Ahmadinejad in an extensive schedule of provincial visits that opponents claim is designed to promote the former for the June elections .
Pro -
Khamenei conservatives have labelled Mashaei the head of a "" deviant current "" in Ahmadinejad 's inner circle , accusing him of undermining clerical power by advocating nationalism , putting Iran ahead of Islam , and favouring greater cultural openness .
Ahmadinejad 's unwavering support for Mashaei has cost the president a great deal of influence in Iranian politics .
Ahmadinejad has been drawn into a bruising power struggle with the conservatives , many of them his former supporters , and has issued serious challenges to Khamenei , such as engaging in public spats with top - level officials .
Khamenei is thought to be tolerating Ahmadinejad only to avert any risk of greater embarrassment , especially as the president appears to be going out with all guns firing .
Conservatives widely predict that Mashaei will be rejected by the guardian council if he enters the race , while others say Ahmadinejad will fight to the end should that happen .
Khamenei this week strongly warned officials against any plans to postpone the June elections ."
2013-05-07,"The editor of an Iranian news website , Ali Ghazali , was arrested on Sunday after carrying a report claiming that a tape recording existed of the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , discussing vote rigging in the disputed 2009 election .
Ahmadinejad 's office has strongly denied the report that appeared on the Baztab website last month .
No tape has since surfaced .
Ghazali 's arrest was reported to the Associated Press by one of the website 's journalists , Ammar Kalantari .

2013-05-08,"In 2005 many in Iran 's political class scoffed at reformist candidate Mehdi Karroubi for suggesting he would give every adult 500,000 rials a month ( then around $ 57 ) from the country 's energy sales if he was elected president .
But in winning 17.2 % of votes in the first round – not far behind Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on 21 % and the eventual winner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on 19.5 % – Karroubi finished comfortably ahead of the man considered the main reformist candidate , Mostafa Moein , on 13.8 % , who fought the election on the traditional reformist themes of social and political freedoms .
Ahmadinejad won a 61.7 % majority in the second round runoff against Rafsanjani .
Karroubi was not the only candidate to use redistributive rhetoric in the 2005 campaign .
In defeating Rafsanjani in the runoff , Ahmadinejad said he would "" put the oil money on the sofreh "" – the square cloth placed on the floor on which poorer Iranians set their meals .
Again in 2009 , the economy was the major issue ; and although Karroubi polled badly in a disputed election , Mir Hossein Mousavi , another reformist candidate , fought a skilful campaign that blended day - to - day issues with the traditional reformist call for civil and political rights .
Now , the economy is still at the centre of election debate , with a large field of would - be candidates criticising the economic management of Ahmadinejad , who is ineligible under the constitution for a third consecutive term .
At the core of economic policy is the tension between resources going into short - term consumption or into the investment required for long - term growth .
Despite having the world 's second - largest reserves of both gas and oil , Iran has been less than successful in using energy revenue to develop other sectors .
The former government of Mohammad Khatami ringfenced windfall oil revenue in 2000 in the Oil Stabilization Fund , in order to assist private sector investment , but political pressures led both parliament and government to raid the fund even before Ahmadinejad replaced Khatami in 2005 and adopted a populist course , including replacing state subsidies of everyday items – like petrol and bread – with cash payouts .
Ahmadinejad has continued this course even in the last year as tightening western sanctions have halved Iran 's oil sales , with the government admitting that in the year ending in March state revenue was at $ 77bn — well below the budget projection of $ 117bn .
With the private sector squeezed by sanctions and the state short of development resources , the economy is well short of the 8 % growth target set by the fifth five - year development plan , which guides government policies from 2010 to 2015 .
The International Monetary Fund projects the economy will shrink by 1.3 % in 2013 .
With unemployment at 13 % and inflation at 32 % , many voters have lost confidence in Ahmadinejad 's approach .
Farideh Farhi of the university of Hawaii argues his populist measures may still appeal in rural areas but less so in the cities and towns where around two - thirds of Iranians live . ""
Past promises have made people sceptical , "" she says .
"" And they also have demands that relate to better delivery of government services . ""
This could lead to candidates offering very similar , almost technocratic agendas . ""
Yes the election may turn out to be about hiring a competent CEO , "" says Farhi , "" perhaps with a tinge of hope that he will be better able to reduce the tensions with the US . ""
But an Iranian business journalist and businessman said there could be some mileage left for populist policies that play to the poor .
"" The bottom half and top half disagree on some things and agree on others . ""
Those on low and let 's say low - middle incomes would like more government involvement in the economy , with more handouts , and they are against privatisation .
Those on higher and high - middle incomes do n't approve of handouts , and would like to see less government involvement , although they would like bank loans and low lending rates .
"" Everyone agrees , however , on two things : that there is corruption throughout the economy and that privatisation as practiced so far is a proxy for corruption and transferring ownership to favoured groups . "" Relations with the west are bound to be some kind of election issue , if only because sanctions have now had such an effect on the economy .
But again , with candidates keen to stay within the guidelines laid out by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei of maintaining Iran 's "" rights "" to nuclear technology , this may boil down to competing claims to be skilful in diplomatic manoeuvring rather than advancing competing agendas .
One exception to such consensus could be Rahim Esfandiar Mashaei , Ahmadinejad 's leading aide and chosen successor , but he may not pass vetting by the Guardian Council , the state watchdog that assesses the "" suitability "" of candidates .
If he runs , Mashaei will presumably extend Ahmadinejad 's themes of redistributing wealth and tackling corruption .
A further exception could be Kamran Baghari Lankarani , Ahmadinejad 's former health minister , who is running with the backing of the Jebhe - ye Paydari ( the Resistance Front ) , a grouping that wants to continue the purer ideals of the revolution and is sceptical of any dealings with the US . ""
The Paydari Front may make a case for continued pursuit of revolutionary ideals and economic justice , rejecting the so - called western - oriented technocratic solutions to Iran 's problems , "" says Farhi . ""
But the more common slogans for platforms so far such as progress , wisdom , competence suggest that most candidates will be running against Ahmadinejad 's erratic decision - making style and what is now openly identified as empty populist promises . """
2013-05-11,"Leading contenders in Iran 's forthcoming presidential election emerged on Saturday after registration for potential candidates ended with top figures from major rival camps entering what is likely to become a highly contentious race .
Former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and the incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's close ally , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , have both registered as candidates for next month 's presidential election .
Rafsanjani , who is expected to win the support of the country 's reformers , and his hardline rival both announced their candidacy just before the deadline on Saturday .
Since Tuesday when the official registration had began , there were anticipation on whether the two men , who are feared to issue challenges to the establishment by their candidacy , would eventually sign up .
More than 680 candidates , including at least a two dozen women , have registered but Iran 's Guardian Council , a powerful group of six clergymen and six jurists controlled by the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has the final say on who can stand .
Only a handful of candidates are expected to be allowed to run in the 14 June vote .
Saeed Jalili , Iran 's chief nuclear negotiator and a close ally of Khamenei , also registered at the interior ministry in Tehran 's Fatemi street on Saturday , which was a crucial port of call for those wishing to succeed Ahmadinejad .
Rafsanjani , 79 , is one of Iran 's great political survivors who played an instrumental role in the appointment of Khamenei as the current supreme leader after the death in 1989 of the Islamic republic 's founder , Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini .
However , Rafsanjani and Khamenei have been at odds since the former lost to Ahmadinejad in 2005 presidential election .
In 2009 , Khamenei sided with Ahmadinejad who was alleged to have won in a rigged election while Rafsanjani showed moderate support for the opposition Green Movement and its leaders who disputed the results .
As a result of his confrontation with Khamenei who has the final word in all state matters in Iran , Rafsanjani 's authority has diminished in recent years and two of his children were jailed last year on separate charges but his candidacy can possibly play as a game changer .
Despite this , many believe that he has a strong base among clerics and can draw a great deal of support from reformists because of his sympathy with the opposition .
Although Rafsanjani and Mashaei are rivals with complete different political allegiances , they are both loathed by the supporters of Khamenei for allegedly attempting to undermine his power .
Rafsanjani signalled last week that he would not run without Khamenei 's consent .
It was unclear on Saturday whether the supreme leader had in fact intervened in the final hours before registration drew to a close .
Mashaei was accompanied by Ahmadinejad as he put his name forward for the 14 June vote , local news agencies reported .
The president soon came under attack for showing his support for Mashaei while holding an official position but dismissed the criticism , saying he was on a day off from work on Saturday . ""
Mashaei means Ahmadinejad and Ahmadinejad means Mashaei , "" the president said in a joint press conference with his top aide soon after he registered .
The pair displayed victory signs as they took their hands up .
Under the Iranian election law , Ahmadinejad is limited to two consecutive terms but has been widely accused of grooming Mashaei to succeed him as part of a plan for a Putin / Medvedev - style power grab .
Tehran 's mayor , Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf , and Ahmadinejad 's elder brother , Davoud , were also among the politicians who registered on Saturday .
Ghalibaf , a conservative with strong ties to Khamenei , has formed a coalition with two other prominent figures with similar political leanings , Ali Akbar Velayati , a senior adviser to Khamenei , and Gholam Ali Haddad Adel , a former parliamentary speaker .
All three men have registered but according to the coalition plan , only one is eventually supposed to run .
Davoud Ahmadinejad , a former inspectorate - general at the presidential office , fell out with his brother over the president 's choice in a cabinet appointment and his unwavering support for Mashaei .
Since then , the elder brother has sided with the president 's opponents and has embarrassed Ahmadinejad by speaking out against top presidential aides who are accused of being members of a so - called "" deviant current "" in Ahmadinejad 's inner circle .
Ahmadinejad 's support for Mashaei , who is accused of being the leader of the "" deviant current "" , has cost the president a great deal of influence in Iranian politics .
Ahmadinejad has been drawn into a bruising power struggle with the conservatives , many of them his former supporters , and has mounted serious challenges to Khamenei , such as engaging in public spats with top - level officials .
During the registration process politicians from various political groups have stepped forward , including Hassan Rouhani , a reformist , and Ali Akbar Javanfekr , a top presidential aide and Mohsen Rezaee , a former commander of the revolutionary guards .
But with former presidential candidates from the previous vote in 2009 , Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , still under house arrest four years after an election that resulted in months of unrest and bloodshed , the opposition Green Movement sees little legitimacy in this year 's poll .
The reformists have not called for an active boycott and Rafsanjani appears their favoured choice .
The opposition website Kaleme reported on Saturday that security officials have surrounded the areas close to the office of the former reformist president Mohammad Khatami , preventing his supporters from visiting him .
In the wake of his house arrest , Khatami refrained from running but has endorsed Rafsanjani .
According to the 1979 Iranian constitution , the supreme leader is the head of the Iranian state and president heads the government .
For 10 years after the revolution Iran had a prime minister as well as a president , but the position was abolished in 1989 .
Since then , all Iranian presidents have served two consecutive terms ."
2013-05-21,"Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , the leading opposition - backed candidate in Iran 's presidential election , was disqualified on Tuesday from standing in a blow to those hoping for significant change when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad leaves office .
Iranian state - run television broadcast a statement by the interior ministry on Tuesday night announcing the final list of candidates .
It did not include Rafsanjani or President Ahmadinejad 's close ally , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei .
Eight men were allowed to enter the race for the election on 14 June , including Iran 's chief nuclear negotiator , Saeed Jalili ; the mayor of Tehran , Mohammad - Bagher Ghalibaf ; and former foreign minister Ali Akbar Velayati .
Hassan Rouhani , a reformist who is seen as having little chance of victory , was also allowed to run .
Jalili is widely seen as the favourite candidate of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
More than 680 people , among them some 40 prominent figures , registered as potential candidates this month in the hope of succeeding Ahmadinejad , but the six clergymen and six jurists of the Guardian Council allowed only a handful to stand .
The council 's spokesman , Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei , said on Tuesday the vetting process had ended and the final list of candidates had been sent to the interior ministry but did not name those qualified , the semi - official Isna news agency reported .
The candidates were then announced on national TV .
Conservative websites and semi - official agencies had earlier reported that Rafsanjani , 78 , who has won the support of the country 's reformers , had been disqualified because he is seen as too feeble to govern the country .
His supporters said the reports amounted to no more than rumours spread by rival camps .
"" If an individual who wants to take up a high post can only perform a few hours of work each day , naturally that person can not be confirmed , "" Kadkhodaei said earlierthis week , boosting speculation that Rafsanjani would be blocked .
Two of the Guardian Council 's 12 members are older than Rafsanjani .
The hardline Kayhan newspaper , whose director is appointed by Khamenei , ran an editorial on Tuesday calling on the Guardian Council to disqualify Rafsanjani , saying he had become the favourite candidate of the country 's enemies and opposition . ""
A divine and serious responsibility rests on the shoulders of the Guardian Council .
It is to rescue Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani from a dangerous bait that has been set for him by foreign enemies and their domestic associates , "" wrote Kayhan 's Hossein Shariatmadari .
Rafsanjani 's office fought back by issuing a statement saying his opponents had resorted to fabricating news in order to distort the old man 's image .
Rafsanjani 's disqualification would come as a surprise to many of his supporters , who thought it unlikely the Guardian Council would reject him , given his crucial role in founding the Islamic republic and his position as one of the country 's great political survivors .
Ali Motahari , an influential MP who was appointed on Tuesday as head of a major campaign group supporting Rafsanjani , predicted that Khamenei might intervene to reinstate Rafsanjani . ""
Rafsanjani played a significant role in founding the Islamic republic …
His disqualification will call into question the very principles of our revolution and the principles of the ruling system of the Islamic republic , "" he told the semi - official Isna news agency .
Rafsanjani is head of Iran 's expediency council , which mediates between the parliament and the Guardian Council .
Mashaei , who is seen as a nationalist figure , was widely expected to be barred despite Ahmadinejad 's unwavering support .
Supporters of Khamenei have accused Mashaei of putting Iran ahead of Islam and not showing enough loyalty to the supreme leader .
The Iran News Network , a pro - Ahmadinejad website , reported on Monday that a group of activists and campaigners sympathetic to Mashaei had been arrested and some summoned for questioning .
Access to at least four pro - Mashaei websites was blocked last week .
Analysts fear that Ahmadinejad might go out with all guns firing following Mashaei 's disqualification .
The president was reported to have cancelled three of his provincial visits this week to stay in the capital , Tehran .
Meanwhile , the Fars news agency , which is affiliated to the elite Revolutionary Guards , published a series of interviews with some leading clerics who called on people to respect the Guardian Council 's decision .
Rafsanjani was a close confidant of Khamenei for much of the 1980s and 1990s but the pair fell out when the former lost to Ahmadinejad in the 2005 presidential vote .
The rift between the two widened when Rafsanjani voiced moderate support for Iran 's Green movement in 2009 while Khamenei stood firm by Ahmadinejad and denied any allegations of vote rigging .
Rafsanjani 's last - minute entry in Iran 's presidential race had revived hopes among the country 's reformers for a change in the country 's trajectory and infuriated hardliners who believed his candidacy would challenge Khamenei 's authority ."
2013-05-22,"The daughter of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , the founder of Iran 's Islamic republic , has protested against the disqualification of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani from next month 's presidential election .
Zahra Mostafavi has written to the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , calling on him to reinstate Rafsanjani in order to prevent the forming of a dictatorship .
Neither Rafsanjani , a confidant of Khomeini and the opposition 's favoured candidate , nor President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's close ally Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei were among the eight candidates approved by the guardian council to enter the ballot out of at least 680 people who registered this month .
Ahmadinejad expressed dissatisfaction with the decision against Mashaei , describing it as an act of oppression .
He promised to raise the issue with Khamenei . ""
In my opinion there will be no problem with the supreme leader and I will take up this issue until the last moment with him , "" Ahmadinejad said on Wednesday .
"" I am hopeful the problem will be solved . ""
The guardian council , a powerful body of six jurists and six clergymen , vets all candidates to make sure they have sufficient loyalty to the Islamic republic and its principles , but critics say the group 's function is undemocratic .
It does not publicly give reasons for its decisions but Rafsanjani , 78 , is said to have been barred because he was considered too old and Mashaei for being a nationalist figure .
Rafsanjani 's moderate support for the opposition Green movement is also believed to have counted against him .
Unlike Mashaei 's rejection , which was widely expected , Rafsanjani 's exclusion has come as a surprise to many , especially supporters of the Islamic republic who regard him as one of Iran 's great political survivors , formerly serving as president for two consecutive terms .
Rafsanjani 's supporters see many ironies in his disqualification , not least that he is currently head of the expediency council , which mediates between the guardian council and parliament .
Two of the guardian council 's members are older than Rafsanjani , and Khomeini was not much younger when he took power in 1979 .
In Mostafavi 's letter – published on Jamaran.ir , a website close to Khomeini 's family – she wrote : "" Unfortunately I see that the guardian council has blocked him [ Rafsanjani ] for presidency …
This act has no meaning other than creating a separation between two companions of the imam [ Khomeini ] and a disregarding of the enthusiasm and interest of the people towards the system and the elections , "" She wrote that Khomeini had thought of Rafsanjani as a potential candidate to succeed him as supreme leader , and cited a saying by her father with the message that the supreme leader should prevent any occurrence of dictatorship . ""
The gradual separation between the two of you [ Khamenei and Rafsanjani ] will be the biggest blow to the revolution and the system , "" she wrote .
"" The imam always said : ' These two are good when they are together . '
"" Rafsanjani has yet to respond to his disqualification but Eshaq Jahangiri , the head of his official campaign , told the Isna news agency that he would not object .
Not all of Rafsanjani 's supporters were upset with his disqualification .
One said it showed "" the empress has no clothes "" , referring to how Khamenei was tightening his grip on Iranian politics .
Abolhassan Banisadr , Iran 's first post - revolution president , who now lives in exile , told the BBC 's Persian service that Rafsanjani 's last political gamble had paid off by exposing the establishment 's increasing dogmatism .
Karim Sadjadpour , of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , tweeted : "" Increasingly looking like Iran 's presidential election will be one man , one vote .
That one man 's name is Ayatollah Khamenei .
"" Wednesday 's newspapers in Tehran largely avoided the disqualifications and instead focused on the eight men allowed to stand .
Tehran residents on social networking websites reported a heavy presence of security forces on the streets on Tuesday night as the final candidate list was announced on state - run TV , and complained of an increase in online censorship and slower internet connections .
The final list of candidates includes few reformist figures but they seem to have little chance of victory .
Tehran 's mayor , Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf , and Iran 's chief nuclear negotiator , Saeed Jalili , who is seen as Khamenei 's favourite candidate , are on the list .
Ali Motahari , a Tehran MP whose father was a prominent revolutionary figure , objected to Jalili 's candidacy , saying he had little experience in executive positions .
Many analysts believe that the disqualifications have smoothed the path for Jalili to potentially succeed Ahmadinejad .
Mehdi Khalaji , a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , said on Tuesday that Khamenei was sending a message that Tehran would not compromise over its nuclear programme ."
2013-06-07,"Hassan Rowhani , one of the eight candidates approved to run for the Iranian presidency , has long been considered a centrist conservative , but over the past week of the campaign he has shown more of his reformist colours .
The lone cleric in the race , he is also the candidate with the best chance of winning consensus support from Iran 's beleaguered reformist camp .
Those who explicitly identify as reformists have been all but eliminated from Iran 's political system since the protests over the 2009 vote that was officially won by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Now , local media outlets are full of statements by reformists saying they will form a coalition with Rowhani and another less popular ( though openly reformist ) candidate , Mohammad Reza Aref , whereby one of them – almost certainly Rowhani – will be declared the standard bearer to avoid splitting the progressive vote .
"" We will open all the locks which have been fastened upon people 's lives during the past eight years , "" Rowhani said during a speech on 1 June in the north Tehran neighbourhood of Jamaran .
"" You , dear students and hero youth , are the ones who have come to restore the national economy and improve the people 's living standards .
We will bring back our country to the dignity of the past . ""
Rowhani , who may have already had a progressive bent due to his long - standing relationship with reformist ex - president Mohammad Khatami , has been engaging in such talk in televised interviews and debates all week .
The serene - looking cleric has thereby generated at least a faint spark in a reformist camp that has been moribund for some time .
Tuesday night , in a 30-minute documentary more biography than manifesto , he verged on crossing Iran 's media "" red lines "" as he criticised the harassment of Iranian civilians by "" plainclothes people "" – a clear reference to the Basij militia – and the country 's "" securitised atmosphere "" .
He also poured scorn on Ahmadinejad 's record , though that is by now a million miles from any red line .
Elsewhere in the documentary , Rowhani , who is campaigning on the slogan Government of Proficiency and Hope , talked of "" interaction with the world "" and gender equality . ""
In my government , differences between women and men wo n't be tolerated , "" he said .
In an interview on state TV on 27 May that received little attention in the west , Rowhani , Iran 's lead nuclear negotiator during Khatami 's 1997 - 2005 administration , blamed the nezaam ( ruling system ) of the Islamic Republic for the failure to engage in direct talks with the US . ""
[ Non - negotiation ] was the decision and , thus , the US was set aside , "" he said .
When asked directly if it was the US that had in fact taken the first step towards negotiation , Rowhani simply replied , "" Yes . ""
This contradicts the prevailing orthodoxy not only in the west , but the official line in Iran as well .
In another incident on Tuesday , Rowhani visited Isfahan to attend the funeral of reformist - leaning cleric
Ayatollah Jalaledin
Taheri instead of the state event commemorating the anniversary of the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , father of the Islamic Republic .
Along with cries of "" Death to the dictator "" directed at Khomeini 's successor , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , crowds chanted : "" Isfahan in one word : Rowhani .
That is the end [ of discussion ] . ""
Notably , the Rowhani campaign did not try to play down the candidate 's attendance at what has been described as the largest anti - government protest in the country in more than two years .
The campaign subsequently tweeted , "" People of # Isfahan broke out in chants in favour of # Rowhani . ""
Though Rowhani may stimulate the reformists to back him and mobilise disenfranchised voters to the polling venues , he is no firebrand reformer .
He has so far cleverly toed the line between appeasing the establishment by showing due deference to Khamenei and exhibiting his revolutionary and Islamic bona fides .
The documentary described Rowhani 's role in fomenting dissent against Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and his association with key figures in the development of Iranian revolutionary ideology , such as Ali Shariati and Mehdi Bazargan .
The Shah 's notorious intelligence service , SAVAK , was discovered after the revolution to have been monitoring Rowhani .
Although opinion polling in Iran is fraught with difficulties , and the results are notoriously unreliable , many news websites and media organisations run informal polls online .
Over the last ten days , Rowhani has come out on top more often than not , while the candidate widely regarded as Khamenei 's favourite , incumbent nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili , has only scored single - digit points in almost all cases .
With the conservatives having failed to unify and rally behind one or two preferred candidates as expected , the prospect of reformists snatching enough of the electorate to trigger a second - round runoff seems an increasing possibility .
However , almost all analysts still place Rowhani 's better - known conservative rivals well ahead of him in the race .
Currently Tehran 's popular mayor , Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf ; former foreign minister Ali Akbar Velayati , now Khamenei 's top international affairs adviser ; and the arch - conservative Jalili appear to stand a better chance of winning .
Many Iranians are convinced that the 2009 vote was grossly manipulated to ensure Ahmadinejad 's re - election over his reformist challenger , Mir Hossein Mousavi .
Given that history , it 's not clear that Rowhani would be allowed to take office even if he managed to score a victory at the polls .
Asked if she thinks Rowhani has any chance , Ziba , 26 , a self - employed businesswoman with family connections to the Khatami administration , says , "" No way .
Because all the people who think like him wo n't be voting anyway …
Besides , they would n't allow him to win . ""
That fear was underscored by the Associated Press report that seven – later revised to "" several "" – aides working on Rowhani 's campaign were arrested at the Jamaran rally on Saturday .
The next day , Gen. Ismail Moghadam , chief of the national police , declared that his forces would not hesitate to "" confront individuals who commit counterrevolutionary behaviour . ""
He held up what transpired at the rally as an example of the police carrying out that "" task . ""
Still , some self - identified reformists are holding out hope for Rowhani . ""
He thinks like we do , "" says Zahra , 29 , the daughter of an Iran - Iraq war martyr .
"" He 's very intelligent .
He 's been biding his time .
"" Others are far more sceptical .
Thirty - year - old Aziz says , "" We 've had eight years of Rafsanjani , eight years of Khatami .
Where did that get us ?
Things are worse now than ever . ""
If Rowhani wins , so what ?
If Ghalibaf wins , what real difference will it make ?
Sure , there may be some small changes , but still the Supreme Leader controls which direction the country is going in . ""
For the moment , Rowhani has injected some life into what looked to be a very humdrum campaign .
Will the reformists openly back him in the end ?
Doing so might serve only to legitimise the election to the benefit of Iran 's staunchly conservative establishment .
Names have been changed"
2013-06-14,"Predicting the outcome of Iranian presidential elections is notoriously difficult – Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was virtually unknown when he won his first term in 2005 .
But aside from the near certainty of surprises the only other constant is that the outside world will be hoping to see different policies from whoever replaces the unlamented incumbent .
Satisfaction is far from guaranteed .
Surging support for the cleric Hassan Rouhani over the past few days has been a salutary reminder of the volatility of these races .
Under Iran 's hybrid political system presidential candidates are vetted on the authority of the theocratic "" supreme leader "" but chosen by popular vote .
The country 's reformists are still battered and bruised – their two candidates in 2009 remain under house arrest – but supporters of the "" Green "" movement who believe they were robbed last time are still there and anxious to see better times .
Appearances count for a lot .
The Iranian establishment has worked hard to forestall the sort of mass protests that followed the disputed election four years ago – not least because since then the world has witnessed the Arab uprisings ( Tehran has relished portraying them as an "" Islamic awakening "" ) as well as the unrest in neighbouring Turkey .
Restrictions on the internet and domestic and foreign media are part of this preventive strategy .
Turnout , always seen as important to underline the democratic legitimacy of the Islamic Republic in the face of its enemies at home and abroad , will matter too – though very large numbers are likely to favour the more moderate candidates .
Whoever becomes president , however , will face a familiar set of pressing domestic and international issues .
The biggest one is the economy , battered by tightening sanctions imposed by the US to apply pressure over stalled nuclear negotiations .
Iran 's economy faces severe and long - standing structural problems that have been aggravated by the sanctions – even if it remains a taboo to link the two explicitly .
Exchanges between the leading candidates on this point have been coded but unmistakable .
It is clear , however , that the big issue is that of Iran 's isolation in the wider world – the point on which the clownish and provocative Ahmadinejad aroused most anger .
It was striking that Ali Akbar Salehi , the foreign minister , declared as he cast his vote that he hoped for improved relations with the US – a handy reminder that , revolutionary ideology aside , many Iranians still admire America .
Making precisely the opposite point , the Supreme Leader himself – who at 74 seems unlikely to temper his hostility to the country which engineered the overthrow of Mossadegh and backed the shah – lashed out at Washington . ""
To hell with you if you do not believe in our election
! "" said Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
It was a blunt response to comments by US officials that they do not have "" high expectations "" that the election will change "" the fundamental calculus of Iran "" .
That certainly seems true of Saeed Jalili , the hardliner and current nuclear negotiator who is seen as Khamenei 's personal choice .
But would a different winner , Rouhani or Mohammed Bagher Qalibaf , the technocratic mayor of Tehran , display more flexibility to win support among young Iranians ( a third of the 50-million - strong electorate are under the age of 30 ) though that could risk the opposition of the powerful Revolutionary Guards , the loyal keepers of Khomeini 's flame ?
Maybe .
But on the international issues it still seems unlikely .
"" Whoever wins will be very limited in their ability to influence foreign and nuclear policy , "" warns Ali Ansari of St Andrews University .
Expectations in the west , then , are sensibly low .
But if there is to be change for the better in Iran after this election it could perhaps come in a new and better - functioning relationship between Khamenei and the president after the ructions of the Ahmadinejad years – his departure at least bringing audible sighs of relief from his many enemies ."
2013-06-14,"Iran 's presidential race appears poised for a runoff vote next week after millions of people queued until late across the country night to elect a successor to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Election officials at Iran 's interior ministry were yet to announce final results but a high turnout after a last - minute excitement caused by the reformists ' endorsement of a moderate candidate boosted the chances of a second round next Friday .
Hassan Rouhani , the moderate cleric backed by reformists and many opposition figures , and Tehran 's pragmatic mayor , Mohammad - Bagher Ghalibaf , looked likely to emerge on top , with the chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili , thought to be the favourite candidate of the clerical establishment , falling behind .
Around 4 am Tehran time , the semi - official Mehr news agency cited unconfirmed reports saying Rouhani and Ghalibaf were leading in the initial counts .
At the same time , Rouhani 's campaign also announced he had entered the interior ministry for a visit and talks with officials .
From the moment the polls opened state - run TV broadcast rolling coverage with a string of interviews with people sympathetic to the system .
Voting was initially due to end at 6 pm local time but was extended for at least five hours .
Speaking after casting his vote in Tehran , Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , urged citizens to come out en masse to refute suggestions by American officials that the election in the Islamic Republic enjoyed little legitimacy .
"" I recently heard that someone at the US national security council said ' we do not accept this election in Iran ' , "" he said .
"" We do n't give a damn . ""
State - run media worked hard to convey the same message .
"" I am here to vote because of my leader [ Khamenei ] , "" one Iranian told Channel 1 of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting .
"" I 'm happy to have a say in my country 's fate , "" said another .
A first - time voter said : "" I 've been in the queue for one hour to vote but that 's no pain , I can wait for hours . ""
A middle - aged man said : "" Our beloved soldiers gave their life for this revolution and became martyrs [ in the eight - year Iran - Iraq war ] so waiting for hours in the queue is nothing in comparison to that .
It 's my duty . ""
Local news agencies reported that all six presidential hopefuls had voted and pledged to respect the results .
Jalili said : "" Any candidate that people choose , and is confirmed by the count of the ballots , should be respected by everyone . ""
Ghalibaf , praised by many for being a successful mayor of the Iranian capital , promised "" fundamental changes "" and a focus on development and justice . ""
People 's choice will be respected by me , too , "" he added .
Another conservative , Ali Akbar Velayati , Khamenei 's top foreign policy adviser , said after voting : "" I request the entire Iranian nation to come to the ballot boxes enthusiastically and elect their favourite candidate since people 's participation is a reaffirmation of their support for the Islamic Republic ruling system . ""
Among those voting was Ebrahim Yazdi , secretary - general of the Freedom Movement of Iran , a banned group that is critical of the system . ""
Today 's election is about choosing between bad and worse , "" he told the semi - official Mehr news agency .
"" Voting is a national duty and a right given to you by God . "" At least three children of the former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , who was disqualified from standing , were also reported to have voted .
Rafsanjani has publicly backed Rouhani earlier in the week and voted for him on Friday .
Ahmadinejad , who served for two tempestuous terms marked recently by deteriorating relations with the supreme leader , voted in late afternoon – breaking with the convention that senior officials vote early as a sign of loyalty to Khamenei .
Iran 's interior minister , Mostafa Mohammad - Najjar , said the hours of voting were being extended because of a high turnout , state - run Press TV reported .
It said turnout in Tehran Province was predicted to reach 70 % — though analysts look sceptically at official figures .
Official statistics show that more than 50 million Iranians were eligible to vote , among them 1.6 million for the first time .
In 2009 , when Ahmadinejad won his second term , the opposition Green movement claimed victory and said the result had been rigged .
Its leader , Mir Hossein Mousavi , remains under house arrest .
Analysts believe rigging is less likely this year because Ahmadinejad is not running and the current government does not support any of the candidates .
"" Four years ago the violent crackdown on peaceful protests that followed the presidential election exposed the authoritarian nature of those who hold power in Tehran , "" said Faraz Sanei of Human Rights Watch . ""
Today , regardless of who becomes the country 's next president , one thing is clear : the legacy of unfair elections , highlighted by the arbitrary disqualification of opposition figures , detention of government critics , and heavy media censorship continues to deprive Iranians of the right to shape their country 's future .
"" Few western reporters were allowed into Iran for the poll .
One Tehran - based correspondent described thousands of people queuing to vote but not on the scale of 2009 .
Irregularities were reported .
Rouhani 's campaign complained that the name of a former candidate who had withdrawn earlier in the week was still on ballot papers .
Iran 's interior ministry said later that it had dealt with the issue .
Access to Farda , a news website close to Mohammad - Bagher Ghalibaf , was also blocked .
In a strange paradox , the state is so keen during elections to showcase a country ostensibly united despite it differences that normal stringent rules do not apply .
Thus a picture published by a conservative news agency showed a young woman with virtually no head - covering , her headscarf loosely tied at the back of her head .
Iranian women voting abroad reported that they were able to vote without wearing the hijab despite normally strict rules imposed by embassies .
The BBC , meanwhile , complained that Iran had launched a new campaign of intimidation against staff working for its Persian service in London .
Relatives of 15 journalists have been harassed , summoned for questioning and threatened ."
2013-06-15,"Hassan Rouhani chose the image of a key to symbolise his campaign .
The cleric , who has risen from being a centrist figure to the country 's president - elect , was supported by Iran 's battered reformist movement .
On Saturday night , the door to the presidency awaited as he appeared set to succeed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . ""
Ahmadi bye - bye , "" chanted groups of jubilant campaigners who cautiously welcomed his win in central Tehran .
Many desperately hope that Rouhani , 65 , will steer Iran through its severe economic hardship and away from the threat of war .
The moderate , who is the head of Iran 's centre for strategic research , was also the country 's chief nuclear negotiator , serving as the secretary of the supreme national security council for 16 years .
Under president Mohammad Khatami , he was responsible for negotiating with the west over the controversial nuclear programme .
On his watch , Iran agreed for the first time to stop enriching uranium and allowed more scrutiny of the programme , avoiding the risk of being referred to the UN security council and economic sanctions .
During the three - week election campaign , Rouhani positioned himself as a moderate willing to improve Iran 's relations with the west and work to lift sanctions by finding a solution to the nuclear deadlock .
He also indicated that he would work to secure the release of opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi from house arrest ."
2013-06-15,"The moderate cleric Hassan Rouhani has won the Iranian election and will succeed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president , Iran 's interior minister announced on national television on Saturday .
Mostafa Mohammad - Najjar said Rouhani had secured just over the 50 % of the vote needed to avoid a runoff , after a turnout of 72 % .
Rouhani 's win is a welcome surprise for many reformists , who are desperate to break back into mainstream Iranian politics after eight years of Ahmadinejad 's hardline presidency .
Although the only cleric among the eight candidates allowed to stand for election , the 65-year - old is seen as a pro - reform moderate figure .
He has positioned himself as a moderate figure favouring political openness and improved relations with the west .
He has pledged to find a way out of the stalemate over Iran 's nuclear programme that led the west to impose tough sanctions .
"" It is good to have centrifuges running , provided people 's lives and livelihoods are also running , "" Rouhani said during a TV debate .
Rouhani served as the chief nuclear negotiator under the former president Mohammad Khatami .
Under his watch , Iran agreed to halt uranium enrichment and was more co - operative with the inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Organisation .
As early results were announced , some analysts interpreted the likely defeat of Saeed Jalili , Iran 's current hardline chief nuclear negotiator , as a vote of no confidence in the current regime 's nuclear policy .
During the campaign , Rouhani repeatedly noted that on his watch Iran 's nuclear dossier was not referred to the UN security council and no major sanctions were imposed .
Seyed Hossein Mousavian , Rouhani 's deputy in Iran 's national security council between 1997 to 2005 , and a spokesperson for Iran 's nuclear negotiating team , said the early results showed that people in Iran were desperate for a change in the country 's foreign and economic policies .
Earlier on Saturday , Britain 's former foreign secretary Jack Straw described Rouhani as an experienced diplomat , "" warm and engaging "" and "" a strong Iranian patriot "" .
"" This is a remarkable and welcome result so far and I 'm keeping my fingers crossed that there will be no jiggery - pokery with the final result , "" he said .
"" What this huge vote of confidence in Dr Rouhani appears to show is a hunger by the Iranian people to break away from the arid and self - defeating approach of the past and for more constructive relations with the west . ""
On a personal level I found him warm and engaging .
He is a strong Iranian patriot and he was tough , but fair to deal with and always on top of his brief . ""
Trita Parsi , of the National Iranian American Council , said : "" Though hardliners remain in control of key aspects of Iran 's political system , the centrists and reformists have proven that even when the cards are stacked against them , they can still prevail due to their support among the population . ""
Meir Javedanfar , an Iranian politics lecturer at Interdisciplinary Centre in Herzliya , Israel , described the early results as a "" total and absolute surprise "" .
"" If Rouhani wins in the first round , it 'd be a clear sign that after the 2009 uprising , the supreme leader has learned that his regime needs to regain its legitimacy , and that will only come from counting the vote of the people . ""
In 2009 , when Ahmadinejad won his second term , the opposition Green movement claimed victory and said the result had been rigged .
Its leader , Mir Hossein Mousavi , remains under house arrest .
Analysts believe that rigging is less likely this year because Ahmadinejad is not running and the government has not endorsed any of the candidates .
Iran 's rial recovered its value against the dollar by more 6 % as results were announced in Rouhani 's favour ."
2013-06-17,"Iran 's outgoing president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has been summoned to a criminal court in Tehran to answer unspecified charges following the victory of the moderate cleric Hassan Rouhani in Friday 's presidential election .
Local news agencies on Monday published a copy of the summons issued by judicial authorities demanding that Ahmadinejad appear before the court in November , a few months after he has handed over the Iranian presidency to Rouhani .
It revealed little except that a lawsuit had been lodged by the parliamentary speaker , Ali Larijani .
The news , initially announced by the government website dolat.ir , was the latest in a series of bruising setbacks for Ahmadinejad , who has fallen foul of his erstwhile patrons and lost a great deal of influence in Iranian politics . ""
Appear in court following the complaint lodged against you by the head of parliament 's Article 90 committee as well as Ali Larijani , the head of the parliament and Mr Yaghoub Khalilnejad , "" read the summons published by the semi - official Fars news agency .
The government 's website said the charges were not specified .
Rouhani himself has nothing to do with the lawsuit but the timing showed Ahmadinejad 's parliamentary rivals had waited until the election was over before making their complaint public .
Ahmadinejad is scheduled to hand over Iran 's presidency to Rouhani in early August , when the president - elect will be sworn in .
In February , Ahmadinejad and Larijani engaged in a public spat at the highest levels of the Islamic republic when the president played a secretly filmed tape in a public session that implied the speaker 's brother was financially corrupt .
In a dramatic sequence of events that marked the climax of the power struggle between Ahmadinejad and his conservative rivals in parliament , Ahmadinejad 's tape showed Larijani 's brother , Fazel , allegedly trading on his sibling 's influence for financial gain in a conversation with Saeed Mortazavi , the caretaker of Iran 's social welfare organisation .
"" These are audio and video , and the tape is clear , "" said Ahmadinejad at the time .
"" If the honourable parliament speaker sees fit , we can turn over the 24 to 25 hours of recordings to you . ""
A few minutes of a barely audible tape were played as millions of Iranians listened to the extraordinary parliamentary session live on national radio .
"" It was a good thing that you showed this to let people learn about your character , "" Ali Larijani retorted at the time .
Larijani 's brother , Fazel , denied the accusations and threatened to sue him but the incident was enough to tarnish the speaker 's image .
When Ali Larijani delivered a speech in the holy city of Qom shortly after the incident , he was met with angry crowds who threw shoes at him and shouted slogans .
Last month , Ahmadinejad accompanied his close confidant and former chief of staff , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , to the interior ministry as the latter registered his name as a candidate in the election .
However , Iran 's constitutional body , the Guardian Council , disqualified him without giving a reason .
Conservatives close to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , have accused Mashaei of undermining clerical power by advocating nationalism and putting Iran ahead of Islam .
Ahmadinejad , however , has stood by him"
2013-06-17,"Iran 's president - elect , Hassan Rouhani , whose sensational victory in Friday 's election prompted nationwide celebrations , has promised to reduce tensions with the west , show more transparency on its nuclear front and bring moderation back to the forefront of Iranian politics .
In his first press conference in Tehran , two days after being confirmed as the elected successor to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Rouhani presented himself as a moderate politician willing to "" enhance mutual trust "" between Tehran and the international community , including Britain and the US , and as the saviour of the Iranian economy by working to lift sanctions .
"" We have to enhance mutual trust between Iran and other countries , "" said Rouhani , nicknamed in the Iranian media as the diplomat sheikh and the sheikh of hope .
"" We have to build trust , "" he said .
Rouhani made clear that his government will pursue a "" friendly relationship "" with all its neighbours , including the Arab countries , in particular Saudi Arabia .
The press conference , held in Iran 's centre for strategic studies , an institution Rouhani has presided over for 22 years , was at times chaotic , as only a limited number of Iranian and foreign reporters in the packed room were given the chance to ask questions .
The session , which lasted an hour and half , was broadcast live on national television .
In a sharp contrast to the outgoing president , Rouhani avoided issuing inflammatory statements against the west and instead promised improved relations .
He outlined his priorities by saying : "" Your government … will follow up national goals … in the path of saving the country 's economy , revive ethics and constructive interaction with the world through moderation . ""
In regards to Iran 's nuclear programme – which the west suspects to have military dimensions , while Tehran insists it is entirely for peaceful purposes –
Rouhani said his government would restore "" mutual confidence "" by promoting step - by - step measures in order to reassure the international community about Iranian ambitions . ""
The first step will be showing greater transparency , "" he said .
"" We are ready to show greater transparency and make clear that the Islamic Republic of Iran 's actions are totally within international frameworks . ""
He described western sanctions targeting Iran 's economy and its banking system as "" cruel "" and said his government 's goal would be that no new sanctions are imposed and the existing measures are lifted . ""
The Iranian nation has done nothing to deserve sanctions .
The works it has done has been within international frameworks .
If sanctions have any benefits , it will only benefit Israel .
It has no benefits for others , "" he said .
Iran 's national currency was sent into a tailspin last year as the toughest - ever sanctions imposed on Tehran since the 1979 Islamic republic started to have an impact .
A serious shortage of medicine followed as banking restrictions impacted pharmaceutical companies in Iran and hundreds of thousands of Iranians with serious illness were put at risk .
Israel 's prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , said in an interview on Monday that he did not think Rouhani could soothe nuclear tensions because Tehran 's nuclear policies rested in the hands of Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . ""
The Iranian election clearly reflects deep disaffection of the Iranian people with its regime , but unfortunately it does n't have the power to change Iran 's nuclear ambitions , "" Netanyahu said .
Despite the hostility among Iranian hardliners towards British media , a BBC journalist was allowed to ask a question about Tehran - London ties , which were downgraded in 2011 following the storming of the British embassy by angry protesters .
"" We will try to improve relations with all countries we recognise based on mutual respect and the UK is not an exception , "" Rouhani said , signalling that diplomatic relations could be normalised .
UK foreign secretary William Hague said : "" The government hopes that following Dr Rouhani 's election , the Iranian government will take up the opportunity of a new relationship with the international community by making every effort to reach a negotiated settlement on the nuclear issue . ""
When asked by a US journalist if his mandate would included engaging in direct talks with the US , Rouhani said it was a difficult question but signalled it was possible , provided that the US government recognised the rights of Iranian people . ""
The issue of relations between Iran and America is a complicated and difficult issue , "" Rohani said .
"" It is an old wound that needs to be healed . ""
Speaking on Syria , where the west sees Iran as complicit with Syria 's Bashar al - Assad regime , Rouhani said his government would be opposed to foreign intervention .
"" It 's up to the Syrian people to decide for their future , "" he said .
"" We are opposed to terrorism , civil war and foreign intervention and we hope peace and tranquillity will return to Syria through the cooperation with countries of the region and world . ""
Rouhani 's victory was met with cautious optimism in the west , with the White House congratulating Iranians on their choice .
Following his win , Tehran 's stock exchange index has gone up and the national currency , the rial , recovered its value against the dollar .
Web users also said internet speed has improved , with the restoration of access to VPNs used to bypass filtering and less jamming of satellite signals by the state .
Although the Iranian questions were focused mainly on the economy , the president was also pressed on the issues of political openness and press freedom .
In an apparent reference to the house arrest of opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , a journalist asked if he would work to lift restrictions on "" leading political figures who have held key positions after the revolution "" .
Rouhani responded saying it was not only his decision .
At the end of the conference , one person shouted : "" Rouhani remember , Mir Hossein should also be here . ""
One commentator noted it was the first time Mousavi 's name had been heard on national television for a long time and another wondered if he was watching the press conference in his house surrounded by security officials ."
2013-06-18,"Ghorban Ali lived in the shantytowns of Shahr - e Rey , just south of the Tehran city line .
He was a metal worker and a staunch supporter of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the very end .
He felt a close bond with this president who was the son of an ironsmith and seemed to live a life almost as simple as his own , and who was an unreserved advocate for the poor .
For the first time , Ghorban Ali felt there was a voice for him and his concerns in the highest ranks of government .
By the time Ahmadinejad stood for re - election in 2009 , the metal workshop where Ghorban Ali was employed had shut down and the few jobs he subsequently found were either short - term or paid too little to feed him , his wife , their two children and his elderly mother .
During Ahmadinejad 's second term , the government started to pay out a sum originally equivalent to £ 25 a person each month to more than 80 % of all Iranians .
Ghorban Ali was quite happy at first about this small yet reliable source of income , but soaring inflation drastically reduced the value of the fixed payouts .
Increasingly desperate for the means with which to feed his family , Ghorban Ali decided to sell one of his kidneys .
A saturated market , however , meant that the price of a fresh human kidney had fallen unacceptably low .
So he did the next thing that came to mind
: he jumped in front of a car in the hope of collecting diyya , the compensation paid to an injured person by the responsible party ( usually covered by insurance in the case of a motor vehicle accident ) .
He did not foresee that the driver of the car would race away from the scene , leaving him paraplegic and virtually penniless and his family in a more dire situation than ever .
This was Ghorban Ali 's state when I met him .
I belonged to a charitable group that was visiting houses in his neighbourhood , offering food and clothing .
As a doctor , I conducted free examinations and gave out a few basic medical items , from permethrin shampoo for the children with head lice , to blood pressure medication for the elderly .
Ghorban Ali had pneumonia and an ulcerating bedsore .
We sat down , listened , and were crushed by his sad tale .
We managed to gather some funds for his and his family 's assistance , but there was only so much we could do .
Not long afterwards , Ghorban Ali died .
Tehran 's new wealth I wander into a majestic dining room .
From a window with a panoramic view , I see Tehran stretching towards every horizon , leaving me in awe of how vast the city has become .
I stroll to the kitchen , almost as large as some apartments .
I am wary of touching the gold - plated Italian taps .
The entire apartment is elegantly furnished with luxury - brand items .
The tiles , I am told , are also Italian , the chandeliers Czech , the fridge American , the stove German .
And the list goes on .
An old acquaintance of mine , who I will call Saeed , is the real estate agent flogging the place .
He is very happy .
The commission will be the biggest in his career .
Located in the Gheytarieh neighbourhood of north - east Tehran , the apartment has 600 sq metres of floor space , plus a 120-metre balcony .
It is served by a private lift and features an infinity pool sanitised with "" molecular oxygen "" , Saeed explains .
He has been giving me a tour of the most elite properties in his agency 's portfolio .
Having dropped out of medical school to focus on real estate , this is his way of establishing bragging rights .
He tells me that he hopes to have a deluxe apartment of his own in 10 years .
I calculate that on my current salary , saving every penny I can , it would still be decades before I could come up with this property 's asking price of 110bn rials ( £ 5.5 m at the official rate of exchange ) .
All the extravagance is making me dizzy and I ask Saeed whether we can leave .
With a big grin , he nods .
We take the lift down to the garage where he has parked his Mercedes .
He tells me that the car is crucial to his image – without it , the customers wo n't take him seriously .
Over the past week , he says , he has shown the place to 16 potential customers and received two firm bids .
Before Ahmadinejad took office eight years ago , foreign cars were still fairly uncommon in Tehran .
But the northern part of the city , where the nouveau riche are clustered , is now full of vehicles from abroad , high - end ones : Porsches , Maseratis , Mercs , BMWs , the occasional Ferrari or Lamborghini .
Iranian tariffs mean they cost twice as much as they do in other countries , but the demand seems only to grow .
Nor do international sanctions appear to be cramping the style of the status - car set .
The many measures enacted by the US and EU have driven the Iranian economy into the shadows , where seemingly any and all shortcuts and black market deals are countenanced by the regime .
If oil can not be sold through the usual channels , then there are back channels through which it can trickle out – not enough to fund the obligations of the state , but sufficient to keep the gatekeepers in their mansions .
The sanctions and the rampant illegal commerce they have spurred , along with the mismanaged economy , hyperinflation , and the ever - growing money supply have enabled the well - connected elites to plunder the wealth of a nation .
Take a certain colleague of mine .
Through connections long cultivated , he learned of a spike in the price of Iran 's fabled pistachios days before it hit and arranged to purchase and then export a large amount at just the right moment .
With his returns from the deal , he bought thousands of acres of agricultural land in Kazakhstan .
He barters the wheat he grows there at a price much higher than the global average for Iranian oil at an artificially low price , which he then sells in east Asia , generating a huge profit .
In four years , he has built an economic empire and a palatial estate for himself in north Tehran .
Though he has not practised medicine in all that time , he still enjoys being addressed by the title "" doctor "" .
Growing inequality On a pleasant spring evening
, I take a walk around Vanak Square .
One of Tehran 's major crossroads , it sits at the juncture of some of the city 's more expensive neighbourhoods .
At one corner of the square , Hossein , a civil servant by day and taxi driver by night , shouts for passengers to fill up his cab .
He and his wife each have to work two shifts to maintain their lower - middle - class lifestyle .
He seems tired and out of breath but still manages to shout out his destination to attract potential passengers : "" Yousef Abad … Yousef Abad … "" The government payouts that began in October 2010 were linked to economic reforms that saw subsidies on household goods and energy slashed or eliminated entirely .
The plan best served Iran 's rural regions , where large family sizes meant more payouts per household , but those in urban areas , where families are smaller and energy usage much higher , have been hit hard , especially as the rial 's foreign exchange value plummeted , aggravating already intense inflationary pressures .
The monthly individual payout , once worth £ 25 , is now worth less than £ 9 at the "" street "" exchange rate most ordinary Iranians deal with .
Thus , even as Ahmadinejad proclaimed his devotion to relieving the plight of the common man , income inequality rose .
Iran 's Gini index – a statistical measure in which 0 equals absolute equality and 100 equals absolute inequality – climbed from 38.3 in January 2005 , six months before he first took office , to an estimated 44.5 today .
According to one analysis , 40 % of Iranians now live below the international poverty line , almost double the proportion of eight years ago .
And while Ahmadinejad 's bellicose rhetoric concerning foreign affairs , often plainly conceived to outrage , can not bear primary responsibility for the severe international sanctions now in place , his antagonistic posturing undoubtedly facilitated their institution .
The resulting stranglehold on government income through restrictions on oil exports and access to financial systems has placed enormous strains on the Iranian economy .
The oil revenues were a cushion for the government 's repeated management blunders ; without that cushion , all the pressure is put directly on the people who can least withstand it –
those without access to the elites ' shadow economy .
I have seen firsthand , for example , how vital medical supplies are increasingly out of reach for the less - than - wealthy .
One of my patients is a boy who suffers from the genetic disorder phenylketonuria .
The price of the specially formulated milk he requires has quadrupled since last year , so his parents have had to rent out their own home and move into a much smaller , rundown one just to feed their child .
No , drugs are not directly sanctioned , but the financial mechanisms for purchasing them are .
One can only hope that a new government will inspire the international community to take a fresh look at the real effects of punitive sanctions ."
2013-06-22,"The election of Hassan Rouhani , a 64-year - old cleric , to the presidency of the Islamic republic of Iran leaves many people around the world with more questions than answers .
Many of those questions stem from the reaction to the 2009 election when the authenticity of the result – a victory for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad – was cast into doubt .
The speed with which the announcement came on the night of the election confirmed to many that wide - scale irregularities had occurred .
The resultant "" green revolution "" sparked huge protests across the country for six months .
When the fatal shooting of protester Neda Agha - Soltan by an armed militiaman was uploaded on to YouTube the narrative of the last election had been written .
Bloody , contentious and most probably illegitimate .
So it is no wonder that questions were raised about last week 's election .
And yet the fact is that the Islamic republic , although not democratic , has since its inception in 1979 had a representative form of government .
It started with a referendum , it operates under a constitution with regular elections to a legislative assembly and the post of the president .
Even during the eight - year war with Iraq no elections were ever missed .
Thus , the Iranian state has been able to claim its legitimacy through forms of popular mandate .
To say that Iran is n't a regular dictatorship is n't to suggest it is democratic .
By democratic standards , these elections fell short , since they prevented many candidates from standing .
The heavy hand of the supreme leader was felt during the pre - election vetting procedures that smacked of selection rather than election .
The committee that is directly under the supreme leader disqualified both of the reformists ' principal candidates : the pragmatic and wily ex - president Rafsanjani , and the more radical Rahim Mashai , President Ahmadinejad 's deputy and anointed successor .
The field was left to eight candidates who seemed , at first , to be barely indistinguishable from one another – six conservative and two moderate reformists .
The opposition forces based outside the country were delighted and most observers expected a mass boycott .
But then something strange happened and it electrified the campaign .
A series of live TV debates sparked real life into the contest and a real contrast emerged not only between reformists and fundamentalists but among the fundamentalists candidates themselves .
Normally taboo subjects were discussed openly .
Ahmadinejad 's economic mismanagement has delivered an official 30 % inflation rate , a series of diplomatic own goals , an impasse with the international community and backbreaking sanctions .
The TV debates delivered a double blow to the conservative bloc , exposing them as dull and divided , and helped consolidate the reformist vote behind one candidate .
The conservatives were seen as fractured and fractious while both reformist candidates shone and Mohammad Reza Aref , one of the reformist candidates , stood down in favour of Dr Rouhani .
Iran 's 50 million eligible voters were suddenly offered a real contest and responded with a massive turn - out .
Rouhani polled 18 million votes , three times as many as his nearest rival , leaving him with an unassailable mandate .
The new president faces monumental challenges at home and abroad .
The economy is in free fall and the sanctions are having a devastating effect on national morale as well as its health and wealth .
The complications of having to work with a parliament dominated by his enemies and a supreme leader who still holds the major levers of power are daunting .
But Rouhani also rides a massive wave of national support and a feelgood atmosphere , helped along in no small measure by Iran 's recent qualification for the World Cup .
If his first press conference was anything to go by he has more good news to impart , committing himself to liberalisation of the press , lifting the restrictions on trade unions and a determination to find a compromise over the nuclear issue .
There are even suggestions that he will push hard for the release of Mousavi , Karoubi and other leaders of the Green movement .
To the Bush / Blair administrations , Iran was easy to paint in the colours of good and of evil .
What we now need is a more nuanced , sophisticated and informed engagement if we want to help the new Iranian president help himself and his people and save the world from another futile and deadly road to war ."
2013-08-03,"Iran 's supreme leader has formally endorsed Hassan Rouhani as the country 's president , opening the way for the moderate cleric to take over from Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
In a ceremony broadcast live on state television on Saturday , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei gave his official approval for Rouhani .
As the ultimate authority in Iran , Khamenei has the final say in all key matters , including Rouhani 's upcoming selections for key cabinet posts , such as the foreign and intelligence ministers .
Rouhani , who will take the oath of office in parliament on Sunday , won a landslide victory in the presidential elections on 14 June .
He has pledged to follow a "" path of moderation "" and promised greater openness over the country 's nuclear programme , which has placed it at odds with the west .
All foreign diplomats were invited to the inauguration but Britain declined to send an envoy .
Douglas Alexander , Labour 's shadow foreign secretary , said the decision was ill - judged and short - sighted . ""
Britain should be pursuing a twin - track diplomatic approach to Iran where possible by improving bilateral relations whilst also maintaining peaceful pressure through sanctions , "" he said .
"" An open dialogue with Iran is not only important in relation to Britain 's security , but also to raise vital matters such as freedom of speech and expression in Iran with the newly elected president . ""

2013-08-04,"The inauguration of the new president of Iran , Hassan Rouhani , presents "" an opportunity "" for Tehran to resolve concerns over its nuclear programme and better engage with the west , the Obama administration said on Sunday .
In a statement marking the formal handing over of power to the moderate cleric from his hardline predecessor , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the White House congratulated the Iranian people for "" making their voices heard "" and calling for "" change "" .
It added that should the new government in Iran move towards meeting its "" international obligations "" , then it would find a "" willing partner in the United States "" .
But the apparent olive branch comes amid hawkish calls in Washington for tougher sanctions on Tehran and the possibility of military action if no resolution is found .
In a letter sent to President Barack Obama , 76 senators demanded tougher economic punishment for Iran until the Islamic republic scales back its nuclear ambitions .
It also urged Obama to keep all options on the table , while keeping the door open to diplomacy . ""
Until we see a significant slowdown of Iran 's nuclear activities , we believe our nation must toughen sanctions and reinforce the credibility of our option to use military force at the same time as we fully explore a diplomatic solution to our dispute with Iran , "" the letter states , according to a version seen by the Associated Press .
The letter comes just days after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed new restrictions on Iran 's oil sector and its mining and construction industries .
Senators are expected to take up the same package in September .
The stance from Congress is at odds with that of the Obama administration , which has pursued a softer line on Iran as it transitions the presidency .
Rouhani has pledged to follow a "" path of moderation "" and promised greater openness over Iran 's nuclear program .
The White House appears willing to give the president a chance to put those pledges into action .
The White House statement said : "" We note that President Rouhani recognised his election represented a call by the Iranian people for change , and we hope the new Iranian government will heed the will of the voters by making choices that will lead to a better life for the Iranian people .
The inauguration of President Rouhani presents an opportunity for Iran to act quickly to resolve the international community 's deep concerns over Iran 's nuclear program . ""
The US has long believed that Iran has been working to develop nuclear weapons .
Iran insists its program is for peaceful energy and research purposes only .
The last round of talks between Iran and the wider international community over the issue broke down in April , with seemingly little progress .
At that point , US secretary of state John Kerry hinted that negotiations could be heading towards a deadline , noting that the talks were not an "" interminable process "" .
But the election of Rouhani has seemingly raised hopes of diplomatic solution to the impasse .

2013-08-04,"The inauguration of a new president in Iran is an opportunity for sending messages and Hassan Rouhani did not waste it .
He told America in his inauguration speech yesterday that if it wanted an adequate response from Iran , it should not speak in the language of sanctions .
To distance himself from his predecessor , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Mr Rouhani promised a government of wisdom and hope .
He genuflected to the concept of moderation , refrained from naming any country that Iran considered averse to its interests , and the word "" enemy "" was missing altogether .
Foreign dignitaries were invited to attend for the first time and it is a pity that from Europe only Javier Solana chose to take the offer up .
Mr Rouhani is not a reformist .
He is a centrist who has kept lines of communication open to most of Iran 's competing power centres – the Revolutionary Guards , the clergy and the Majlis , the parliament .
Above all , according to Trita Parsi , head of the National Iranian American Council , Mr Rouhani will not repeat Ahmadinejad 's mistake in challenging the supreme leader .
While he used the language of reformists during his campaign , he was clear to declare his loyalty to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Mr Rouhani hopes to leverage loyalty for some leeway in setting a more pragmatic foreign policy course .
He has already set out on the right track by appointing Mohammad Javad Zarif as his foreign minister .
Zarif , a former ambassador to the UN , was previously involved in secret bilateral negotiations with the US , and is liked by US diplomats .
Whether or not Mr Rouhani succeeds does not depend solely on competing power centres in Iran .
There is a current of thought in US and EU policy - making circles that regards the emergence of a moderate in Mr Rouhani as the product of international pressure and of sanctions .
Ratchet the sanctions up further , as the US House of Representatives has just attempted to do , and Iran will bend a little further , or so this theory goes .
It could not be more ill - judged .
The anti - sanctions movement in Iran is broadly based .
The movement comprises reformists and conservatives alike , and in seeking to lift the sanctions yoke , Mr Rouhani is speaking for everyone in Iran .
Starting to lift the sanctions will require more than just the evidence of Iranian moves towards a solution to the question of nuclear enrichment .
It will need political will , and the spending of political capital .
The White House reaction , which said that Tehran would find a willing partner in the US should it choose to engage , was good , but Barack Obama has also to overcome the belligerence of Congress .
While the White House did not like the house 's bill , it did not spend time in trying to amend it .
Mr Rouhani has already been once round the track of compromise and failure .
As chief nuclear negotiator under President Mohammad Khatami , Iran agreed for the first time to stop enriching uranium and allowed more international scrutiny of the Iranian programme .
Again , the interpretation of Iran 's motives for suspending enrichment is a matter of debate , but the fact is it happened and failed to achieve a reciprocal move from the then Bush administration .
Total suspension of enrichment is not on the cards today , but Mr Rouhani will be cautious not to allow himself to be as exposed to the criticism as he was then that he was too soft with the US and got nothing in return .
The lesson for Mr Obama is not to cut the ground from underneath Mr Rouhani 's feet a second time .
Looking around the Middle East , it is not easy to be an optimist .
Fires are raging everywhere .
Iran 's Revolutionary Guards – despite Mr Rouhani 's protestations that Iran was looking to ease tensions – are up to their necks in Syria and in maintaining a physical link with Hezbollah , which they train and arm .
In negotiating with Iran , a vision unimpeded by wishful thinking is essential .
But an appreciation of how much worse this could get if another Gulf war were to be sparked by an attack on Iran 's nuclear installation is also needed .
If a deal is there to be done with Iran , it should be seized ."
2013-09-19,"The sole Jewish member of the Iranian parliament will accompany President Hassan Rouhani when he travels to New York next week for the UN general assembly .
Siamak Moreh Sedgh , who represents Iran 's Jewish community in the majlis , the country 's parliament , will try to help Rouhani revamp the Islamic republic 's image on the world stage after eight acrimonious years under previous president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who issued controversial statements about the Holocaust .
The move comes after Rouhani pledged to work to improve civil rights for Iranian minorities and provide a bigger role for them in government when he was sworn in to office in August .
Sedgh and Ahmad - Reza Dastgheyb , a Muslim , are the only MPs travelling with Rouhani to the UN , local agencies reported .
After the constitutional revolution , which took place between 1905 to 1907 , Iranian Jews were given a reserved seat in the parliament which they have retained after the 1979 Islamic revolution .
After Ahmadinejad 's departure from power , Rouhani appears to have started an initiative to tell the world that Iran , whose official religion is Islam , is not against Jews .
Rouhani 's Twitter account , believed to be run through his office , surprised many recently by posting a Rosh Hashanah blessing for the Jewish new year .
Iran 's foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , followed in Rouhani 's footsteps by tweeting a similar blessing .
"" Our Jewish countrymen are a recognised minority in Iran and have an active representative in the parliament , "" Zarif told the semi - official Tasnim news agency after his tweet in early September , according to Tehran Times .
"" We were never against Jews .
We oppose Zionists who are a small group , "" he said .
"" We do not allow the Zionists to represent Iran as an anti - Semitic country in their propaganda so they can cover up their crimes against Palestinian and Lebanese people .
"" Iran is believed to have the largest Jewish population in the Middle East after Israel .
The country 's Jewish population declined after the Islamic revolution as many of its members emigrated to Israel or other countries around the world .
Only officially - recognised religious minorities are represented in the Iranian parliament .
Like Jews , Zoroastrians also have a reserved seat but Christians have three , mainly because of their bigger population .
The Baha'i faith , which was founded in Iran , is banned and its members are the most persecuted religious minorities in the country , with no access to higher education .
Sedgh succeeded a famous Jewish Iranian MP , Mauric Motamed , in 2008 and has since been able to retain his seat .
Sedgh 's visa for the US has not yet been issued .
Zarif 's tweet attracted a great deal of attention .
He also responded to a tweet by Christine Pelosi , the daughter of the US politician Nancy Pelosi , who had told the Iranian minister that the Jewish new year "" would have been sweeter "" if Iran ended its Holocaust denial .
Zarif posted to her : "" Iran never denied it .
The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone .
Happy New Year . ""
The Iranian foreign minister was referring to Ahmadinejad ."
2013-09-19,"For young Iranians accustomed to living under the repressive regime of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the past few days have felt very different indeed .
The release of 11 political prisoners , the temporary lifting of government filters on social networking sites , and the warming of Iran - US relations ahead of next week 's UN general assembly have brought new hope of ending Iran 's international isolation and improving the lives of ordianry citizens .
After years of seeing their personal freedoms and political demands quashed , young Iranians hope the efforts of the new government led by President Hassan Rouhani will create open up Iranian society and restore the country 's standing on the world stage .
"" I see hope in all of the unfolding events , "" says student Aryo , 18 .
"" If the country opens up , it will be good for everyone .
We will feel as a part of the world rather than an enemy everywhere we go . ""
Pirooz , a 29-year old artist , was delighted to discover that he could access his Facebook page – for a while – without bypassing government filters .
"" Looks like we 're not this exotic place any more , this black hole where the internet is blocked , "" he said after Facebook and Twitter became temporarily accessible on 16 September , leading to speculation that the government might be prepared to lift the myriad restrictions of personal freedoms to which young Iranians have grown accustomed during the Ahmadinejad years . ""
Of course , they wo n't permit [ social networking sites ] all the way , "" Pirooz said .
"" They can not just open up everything – there would be chaos .
But we 're starting to understand just how much pressure we were under . ""
The relaxation of restrictions on social networking sites , combined with the release of political prisoners , including human rights lawyer Nasrin Soutudeh , has led many of Iran 's young people to believe that the grievances they have voiced since the turbulent 2009 election , which led to months of bloody clashes between Green Movement demonstrators and government forces , are finally being heard by the new administration .
There is now growing hope for the release of Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , two reformist candidates who were placed under house arrest following the 2009 unrest .
"" If they free Karroubi and Mousavi , there will be huge happiness in the streets , "" said Reza , 27 , a Green Movement activist .
Recent statements by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who in an 18 September address to the Revolutionary Guards urged "" heroic flexibility "" regarding Iran 's internal affairs , have also been a talking point .
"" It shows how bad and dangerous things have been for the country , that it got so bad he had to accept change , "" said Reza .
"" Rouhani has much more ability to act in the way he wants now .
Now , he has the opportunity to show the other face of Iranian politics . ""
The change in tone of Iranian politics , coupled with the recent communications between Iran and the United States ahead of the UN General Assembly in New York next week , has also raised confidence in a diplomatic solution to the conflict over Syria and over Iran 's controversial nuclear programme , which has led to economically crippling sanctions .
Iranians also hope that , after Ahmadinejad 's years of bombastic rhetoric and Holocaust denial , the international community will respond positively to the Rouhani administration 's moderated tone . ""
After years of [ being ] classless people who could n't even show the world the real face of Iranians , we have someone professional who can get international respect and at the same time work for the benefit of the country , "" said Afshin , 30 .
While hopeful for detente , he added the situation was not yet ripe for the US and Iranian leaders to meet face to face . ""
[ Barack ] Obama and Rouhani can not meet outright .
After all , here we call America the great devil , a hegemony that takes what it wants .
Both governments have to maintain face .
Let 's not forget that we still have very religious radical forces here that will never agree to great concessions to America . ""
However , observers also noted that sanctions have taken their toll on the regime 's resolve , bringing even Iran 's most conservative forces to the negotiating table .
"" The sanctions are breaking everyone 's knees , "" said Afshin .
"" When factories close and the price of bread skyrockets , there is no room for ideology – there must be an agreement . ""
In the lower - income neighbourhood of Nazi Abad in south Tehran , Ali , a 45-year - old maintenance worker , complained about the doubling price of building materials , saying that "" nothing has changed "" .
Ali is from a nearby village but is living in Tehran , temporarily , he hopes .
He has brought his youngest daughter with him from their village and she lives with him on the 24-hour building site where he works .
"" Nothing 's really changed in the past two months .
They say the price of gold has gone down , but what is that to us ?
I work in agriculture .
I would just ask Rouhani not to terminate the loans Ahmadinejad made to farmers .
He provided agriculture and home loans that were really beneficial .
"" They have n't put an end to the loans yet – and I do n't think they will any time soon .
But I 'm afraid they will eventually because of their animosity toward Ahmadinejad .
"" I think we need to wait six or seven months and see what happens .
They say if they lift sanctions , things will get better .
Rouhani is close to [ former president Akbar Hashemi ]
Rafsanjani and he will tell him what he needs to do .
Rouhani himself is someone the world can respect .
But for now , nothing has changed .
Cement still costs the same as it did . ""
Majid , 40 , owns a car repair shop in Yazd .
He and his wife and two children have travelled to the capital to visit a sick relative .
He 's smoking while waiting for a ride from their host . ""
Rouhani is good , very good , "" he says .
In politics or economics ? ""
Both .
During that so - and - so Ahmadinjad 's government , we were moving in a negative direction .
We 're below zero right now , but at least we 're working our way to zero .
I think we need to give Rouhani a year or two .
It 'll take a long time to get out from under the disaster that idiot brought upon us .
"" I hope Rouhani can revive the bazaar .
I do n't want too much .
I just hope he can repair our society .
Our society is in ruins . ""
Hamid , a 44-year - old advertising executive , was full of praise for Rouhani .
"" We are still having a ball with [ Rouhani in office ] .
Rouhani motchakerim
( we thank you , Rouhani ) .
During Ahmadinejad 's time I had lost all hope .
Now I am much more hopeful –
but there is always reason to be doubtful .
Let 's see what Ahmad Jannati [ hardline cleric ] and General Yahya Rahim Safavi [ of the Revolutionary Guards ] , who will give speeches during Friday prayers , say tomorrow . ""
His friend Mehry , who works in the health industry , appealed to the international media not to exaggerate the situation .
"" I believe that if the western media does not start their crazy sensationalism and sticks to real news rather than overanalysing every single word that every single authority says in Iran , there is a lot of hope .
But when international media keeps on bombarding the airways with issues like ' the leader is now scared ' , or ' the Islamic republic is admitting their defeat ' and similar analysis , it only emboldens the hardliners ( in all camps ) , then this hope will not last long and we will be spiralling back into animosity . ""
Art student Nima , 18 , is more skeptical .
"" I will not say anything until things really change .
I do not want false hopes .
I will comment after I see with my eyes that Obama shakes hands with Rohani and we do not see military actions on any tables anywhere . ""

Names have been changed ."
2013-09-25,"The Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , has put an end to eight years of Holocaust denial under his firebrand predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by condemning the "" crime "" of mass killings of Jews by the Nazis .
In an interview after his largely conciliatory speech at the UN general assembly on Tuesday , Rouhani accepted that the Holocaust had taken place and called it reprehensible .
"" I 've said before that I am not a historian , and when it comes to speaking of the dimensions of the Holocaust , it is the historians that should reflect , "" Rouhani told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour . ""
But , in general , I can tell you that any crime that happens in history against humanity , including the crime the Nazis created towards the Jews as well as non - Jews is reprehensible and condemnable .
Whatever criminality they committed against the Jews , we condemn . ""
Rouhani 's comments were in marked contrast to those made by Ahmadinejad , who grabbed headlines for making inflammatory statements about the Holocaust during his time in office .
Ahmadinejad repeatedly called the Holocaust a myth and a lie perpetrated by the west . ""
They launched the myth of the Holocaust , "" Ahmadinejad said in a speech at a pro - Palestinian rally in Tehran in September 2009 .
"" They lied , they put on a show and then they support the Jews …
The pretext for establishing the Zionist regime is a lie … a lie which relies on an unreliable claim , a mythical claim , and the occupation of Palestine has nothing to do with the Holocaust . ""
Meir Javedanfar , an Iranian politics lecturer at Interdisciplinary Centre ( IDC ) in Herzliya , Israel , interpreted Rouhani 's remarks as the limit he could go within the political and cultural constraints placed upon him .
"" We could say he is disputing the numbers , which is a valid argument , "" Javedanfar said .
"" But he is not saying that six million were not killed .
He is saying whatever the numbers , which could be six million or less , was a crime . ""
Rouhani pushed the envelope as far as it could go , Javedanfar said , without infuriating the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and other conservatives back home .
In the CNN interview , Rouhani said that acceptance of the Holocaust did not require the acceptance of the occupation of Palestine by Israel . ""
This does not mean that on the other hand you can say Nazis committed crimes against a group , now , therefore , they must usurp the land of another group and occupy it .
This too , is an act that should be condemned , "" he said .
During his visit to the UN in New York , Rouhani attempted to revamp the image of Iran so badly hurt under Ahmadinejad .
He was accompanied by Iran 's only Jewish MP , Siamak Moreh Sedgh , and made no direct mention of Israel in his speech to the general assembly on Tuesday .
Despite the charm offensive , Israel 's prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , ordered his delegation to boycott Rouhani 's speech at the general assembly on Tuesday ."
2013-10-08,"In September 2007 , when the then Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , denied , to the jeers of the audience at Columbia University in New York , that homosexuals existed in the Islamic republic , one journalist back home was determined to prove him wrong .
Siamak Ghaderi , who worked as a reporter with the state news agency , Irna , challenged Ahmadinejad 's comments by conducting a series of interviews with Iranian homosexuals and publishing them online .
But this came at a price .
In the aftermath of Iran 's disputed presidential election in 2009 , Ghaderi could not face the amount of censorship imposed on Iranian media and instead set up his own blog , called "" Our Irna "" , in which he reported on the popular unrest that was unfolding .
His blog was filtered and in August 2010 security officials picked him up from his house and took him to prison .
There , he was held in solitary confinement and was refused access to his lawyer or his family for a long time .
In January 2011 , a court in Tehran sentenced him to four years in jail , 60 lashes and a fine for his work as a journalist , including interviews with Iran 's gay community .
He was convicted of a number of charges , including "" insulting the president "" , "" spreading propaganda against the regime "" , "" acting against the national security "" – vague accusations used against many political activists and human rights campaigners in Iran in recent years .
The release in recent weeks of a number of political prisoners in Iran raised hopes that Ghaderi may be among them , but his wife , Farzaneh Mirzavand , told the Guardian that there was no such news .
The veteran Iranian journalist Isa Saharkhiz , who was imprisoned for "" insulting Iran 's supreme leader "" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , is among those freed .
According to Amnesty International , Ghaderi was among at least 14 political prisoners reported to have been flogged in jail in 2012 .
In May , Mirzavand told the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran that her husband had not been given leave from prison since his arrest . ""
During these entire three years , we were perhaps able to see him in person two or three times , "" she said .
"" I do n't wish to pursue this [ the issue of furlough ] any more , because it basically appears as though the follow - ups do n't have any impact .
They made the decisions themselves and they carry them out themselves . ""
Simak insists that I no longer get myself tied up in trips to the prosecutor 's office .
Siamak tells me : ' Live your life ; most of [ my sentence ] has passed and only some of it is left , which I will endure . ' """
2013-10-22,"Iran 's leading student activist , Majid Tavakoli , has been released on bail for the first time after four years in jail .
Tavakoli , considered by international human rights groups as a prisoner of conscience jailed on the basis of his political views and activism , was arrested in 2009 following an anti - government speech at a student gathering in Tehran 's Amirkabir University .
He was later sentenced to eight and half years in prison for a number of charges including "" insulting the supreme leader "" , "" spreading propaganda against the regime "" and insulting the then president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The opposition website Kaleme reported that he was released on £ 120,000 bail after being given leave from the Rajaee Shahr prison in the city of Karaj , west of Tehran , where he is serving his jail sentence .
Iran has a history of asking political prisoners for large sums of money as bail which are usually difficult for their families to raise .
Tavakoli is expected to return to prison within four days , Kaleme said .
A picture of the 27-year - old reuniting with his mother was posted online on Tuesday and circulated by Iranians on Facebook and Twitter .
Tavakoli 's mother has for the most time not been allowed to see or speak to her son while he was in jail .
The Twitter account of Iran 's president , Hassan Rouhani , also retweeted the picture .
Since Rouhani has took office in early August , a number of high - profile political prisoners , including lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh , have been released and some have been given temporary leave for the first time .
According to Amnesty International which has long called on Iran to release Tavakoli for good , his lawyer was not allowed to attend his trial when he was handed down the lengthy prison term .
Tavakoli 's sentence also includes a five - year ban on any involvement in political activities and on leaving the country .
An appeals court upheld his conviction in September 2010 .
Human rights activists say he has been subject to mistreatment in jail and been held in solitary confinement for a long period .
Prior to his arrest in 2009 , Tavakoli had previous priosn experiences .
At the time of his arrest in 2009 , Iranian authorities released a photo of Tavakoli wearing a women 's hijab with a headscarf saying he wanted to escape the university in this clothing .
Activists , however , said it was a desperate attempt to humiliate him in the eyes of public .
In response and solidarity , many male activists posted pictures of themselves in women 's clothing online .
Tavakoli has since been recognised internationally , including being awarded the Norwegian student peace prize in 2013 .
Last month , Amnesty warned against the harsh treatment of student activists in Iran , saying that many have been denied the right to continue their education . ""
Many students are still blocked from their studies because of their peaceful human rights or political activism , or on account of their Bahá'i faith , "" Amnesty said in a statement .
"" Dozens more languish in prison , where they endure harsh interrogations , torture and other ill - treatment , as well as dire prison conditions .
Their convictions typically come after unfair trials .
""
Other prominent student activists who have been jailed in Iran include Bahareh Hedayat , a student and women 's rights activist ; Sayed Ziaoddin Nabavi , a co - founder of Iran 's advocacy council ; Majid Dorri , a member of the advocacy council ; and Navid Khanjani , a member of the Baha'i religious minority .
Baha'is are generally denied access to education in Iran on the basis of their religious beliefs ."
2013-10-24,"Bookshops in Iran could soon be allowed to stock a wider range of titles , after culture minister Ali Jannati said that "" books subjected to censorship or denied permission to be published in the past will be reviewed again "" .
The minister 's words suggested an opening - up of the country 's publishing industry under new president Hassan Rouhani , who has already signalled his willingness to make changes by agreeing to the first presidential telephone conversation with America since the 1979 revolution .
A swathe of literary classics and international bestsellers including Tracy Chevalier 's Girl With a Pearl Earring and Dan Brown 's The Da Vinci Code were banned in Iran in a publishing lockdown imposed by former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2006 , soon after he came to power .
According to Egypt 's Ahramonline news outlet , Jannati told Iran 's official news agency IRNA this week : "" Those books subjected to censorship or denied permission to be published in the past will be reviewed again and new decisions will be made .
Our approach towards freedom of the press and books , as well as relaxing the atmosphere for writers and thinkers , is different from the past and its results will gradually become apparent .
"" In the reformist daily newspaper , Arman , Jannati was quoted earlier this month , saying : "" I sadly learned that some books were denied permission to be published only on the grounds of personal opinions .
I think if the Qu'ran was not a divine revelation , when it was handed to the book supervisory board , they would say some words did not comply with public chastity and would deny it permission for publication . ""
"" I would hazard a guess that we wo n't be seeing The Satanic Verses appear anytime soon in a new Iranian edition , but one hopes that the works of banned Iranian authors such as the great Sadegh Hedayat , Shahrnoush Parsipour and the late Houshang Golshiri will be given freer rein now , "" said Mitch Albert , of Westbourne Press , an independent , London - based publishing house specialising in books on North Africa and the Middle East .
He added : "" The culture minister 's remark that even the Qur'an would not have passed current censorship laws is certainly a strong one , in the Iranian context .
Let us hope it leads to greater freedom of expression . ""
Apart from international imports banned in 2006 , such as William Faulkner 's As I Lay Dying and collections of lyrics by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones , the relaxation of censorship could affect scores of works by Iranian authors including Ebrahim Golestan , and Hedayat , whose novel The Blind Owl was listed as one of Iran 's top 10 books by journalist Kamin Mohammadi .
Albert said that Iran 's cultural overtures were significant and should be taken at face value .
"" I get irritated by people 's reflected caution and the assumption that there must be an ulterior motive .
There is a liberalising strain in the culture which has not been given expression in the past , but they are coming to realise that it 's better to be part of the global community than not , "" he said .
Jannati 's comments echo president Rouhani 's assertion , during his swearing - in speech in August , that he would relax restraints on internet filters .
In an interview with CNN last month , Rouhani said : "" All my efforts are geared to ensure that the people of Iran will comfortably be able to access all information globally and to use it .
There are large social networks at a global level around today .
And I believe that all human beings have a right , and all nations have a right , to use them . ""
The country blocks access to at least five million websites , including Facebook and Twitter .
Rouhani , whose Twitter account , @hassanrouhani , is thought to be run by a close associate , earlier this month tweeted to Jack Dorsey , Twitter co - founder , that he would work to ensure that Iranians have access to all information globally "" as is their # right "" [ ] ."
2013-11-30,"The interim deal between six leading world powers and Iran over its nuclear programme , agreed in late - night talks last weekend , could – if it bears fruit in the long term – transform the wider region ; it could redraw the map of an area that has been gripped by conflict or the threat of conflict for generations .
In the midst of a growing schism between Shia and Sunni Muslims in the Middle East , fuelled by the war in Syria , an agreement that reduces the threat of an Israeli attack on Iran 's nuclear facilities , sanctioned by the US , presents enormous possibilities as well as potential threats .
The first and most obvious benefit of the deal , ignored by Israel 's hawkish prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , his allies in the US Congress and Saudi Arabia , is that the diplomacy that led to the interim six - month agreement is the first indication that under the new president , Hassan Rouhani , Tehran 's clerical regime might now see the benefit of negotiating solutions to the region 's problems , rather than its previous angry posturing under former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
It is conceivable that such a shift might , at some point in the future , involve Tehran reconsidering its support for the Syrian regime of Bashar al - Assad and Hezbollah .
An Iran a step further back from conflict with Israel , and potentially minded to meddle less in the region , would be a good thing if Tehran sticks to its part of the deal : to dilute its stockpile of uranium enriched to 20 % so that it is returned to 5 % enriched , and not go ahead with the commissioning of the Arak reactor , which is able to produce plutonium .
But the deal creates new tensions as well in a Middle East already challenged by the upheavals of the 2011 Arab spring .
Washington 's decision to sideline its allies Israel and Saudi Arabia in the secret bilateral negotiations with Iran that began in August is in some respects as significant for the future as the nuclear deal .
Specifically for Israel , it can be seen as a rebuke to Netanyahu 's long and vociferous insistence that Iran and its nuclear programme be treated by the US as an "" existential threat "" .
It also marks a significant reshaping of the relationship with Sunni Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states .
Riyadh not only fears the influence of a resurgent Iran – with which it is increasingly engaged in a proxy sectarian conflict in Syria – but is furious at what it sees as Washington 's betrayal .
Turkey and Egypt , too , have been discomfited by the prospect that a deal might allow the emergence of Shia Iran – in alliance with Shia - dominated Iraq – as a significant regional power .
It is how these existing rivalries over the Iranian deal fit into the region 's widening fracture lines that will define the future of the Middle East .
A changing region Turkey Relations between Turkey and Iran have been worsening in recent years , not least since Turkey agreed in 2011 to house a Nato radar base and as a consequence of the war in Syria , where Ankara has helped the Sunni rebels .
However , energy - poor Turkey has been hard hit economically by the sanctions regime imposed against Iran .
But the deal in Geneva appears to have given fresh impetus to efforts to thaw relations between Sunni majority Turkey and Tehran , with the Iranian president scheduled to visit Turkey in December .
A thaw in relations between Ankara and Tehran could have positive consequences for efforts to find a peaceful settlement to the war in Syria .
Syria and Lebanon
The interim deal on Iran is a double - edged sword for Syria and Lebanon , which in different ways have both seen the fallout of the increased religious tension stoked by the war in Syria and by competition between Saudi and the Gulf states on one side and Iran on the other .
On the plus side is the notion that if Iran holds to its side of the nuclear bargain it might persuade the international community to give Tehran a role in a Syrian peace process that could bring that conflict to an end .
More likely , in the short term , is that friction between the parties will continue to be played out in proxy confrontations both in Syria , where Iranian Lebanese client group Hezbollah is openly fighting on the Assad side , and in Lebanon itself .
Israel and the peace process The anger of prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu and his allies both in Israel and the US Congress over the deal – which they have compared to the Munich agreement that appeased Nazi Germany – marks a significant foreign policy defeat for Netanyahu and Israel .
A potential casualty of the deal , in a context of the already difficult relationship between Obama and Netanyahu , could be the renewed US efforts to kickstart the Israel - Palestinian peace process – an area in which Netanyahu has long shown himself reluctant to make any meaningful movement .
Sunni and Shia divide
Fuelled in part by the conflict in Syria , the upheavals in the region since the Arab spring have seen growing tension and violence along the fault lines of the Sunni - Shia divide , not least in Shia majority Iraq which has seen sectarian violence growing month by month in the last year .
In Bahrain and Lebanon sectarian tensions have also been rising .
America and the Middle East
After the long military engagement in Iraq , US participation in the fall of Libya 's Muammar Gaddafi and accusations of a muddled and uncertain response to events in both Egypt and Syria , the interim deal is the first real suggestion that President Barack Obama intends to make a mark on the foreign policy front in the Middle East .
Having spoken early in his presidency of his preparedness to speak to America 's enemies , the tentative breakthrough with Iran – not least in the face of opposition by Israel and Saudi Arabia – suggests a willingness to take risks that has long been absent .
Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Saudi - US relations have been frayed for some time .
Points of friction have included Saudi 's irritation over the US attitude towards the Muslim Brotherhood – which it detests – when the Brotherhood was in power in Egypt , and over its fears that any deal with Iran might lead to the resurgence of the world 's most important Shia state .
Since the advent of the Arab spring , Saudi Arabia has positioned itself aggressively in the worsening Shia - Sunni sectarian divide , helping to prop up minority Sunni rule in Bahrain and backing Sunni jihadis fighting in Syria against the Assad regime .
Iran
The interim six - month deal envisages sanctions relief to Iran to the tune of $ 7bn , opening the way for a long - term deal worth exponentially more .
The hope of the Obama administration is that by demonstrating that there are solid economic rewards for Iran in co - operating with international demands over its nuclear programme , it will cement the more moderate government of Hassan Rouhani ( above ) after the rejection by voters of the policies of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Iranian negotiators have warned , however , that because of continuing competition among hardliners and more moderate strands in Iranian politics hardliners could be resurgent without noticeable benefits to Iran .
A fuller international engagement with Iran is also seen by many observers as a prerequisite to negotiating an end to the conflict in Syria .
Tehran supports the Assad regime , concerned – for its own part – over what it sees as the emergence of an increasingly Sunni jihadist influence over those fighting the regime , backed by individuals in rival Saudi Arabia and the Gulf ."
2013-12-02,"The “ end of times ” was a constant theme for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who often said that setting the stage for the second coming of the Mahdi - a messianic figure in Twelver Shiism - was the ultimate spiritual aim of his eight - year presidency .
While the tightened sociocultural atmosphere of his reign ensured that this belief was never publicly ridiculed , his critics often joked behind closed doors that the 57-year - old hardliner had come dangerously close to achieving his goal .
With the economy in shambles and state coffers hemorrhaging cash , voices from both inside Iran ’s power structure and the public are demanding that Ahmadinejad be held culpable for the opulent spending and obstinate political maneuvering that eventually caused him to lock horns with the regime ’s most influential players , including supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
But as the new moderate president Hassan Rouhani grows increasingly critical of his predecessor against the background of an opaque criminal trial , Ahmadinejad ’s case is also raising new questions regarding the rule of law and the accountability of Iran ’s political leaders .
The latest blow to Ahmadinejad ’s reputation came last week in the shape of Rouhani ’s televised address marking his first 100 working days in office .
Fresh from securing a nuclear deal with western powers at the Geneva talks , Rouhani turned his attention to the economy , blaming some of the most pressing domestic problems - from stagflation and currency devaluation to recession and a growing reliance on imports - on the actions of the Ahmadinejad government .
Although he operated with some $ 600bn in oil revenues during his reign , Ahmadinejad ’s presidency left the country with an estimated debt of $ 67 bn , Rouhani said .
While sanctions are partially to blame for the government ’s fiscal problems , Ahmadinejad ’s populist subsidy handouts and affordable housing schemes also contributed by flooding the economy with cash and causing an inflation record of above 40 % , according to Rouhani .
For many Iranians sitting in front of their TV sets , such candid descriptions of mismanagement raised new ire against Ahmadinejad , whose popularity plummeted during his last years in office .
“
He belongs in Evin [ prison ] for what he did to this country , ” said Romtin , 29 , as he watched Rouhani ’s address in his Tehran home .
“
It ’s funny that someone can say this on national TV and there is no reaction .
It ’s like there ’s a silent agreement that whoever is in power can get away with anything .
”
Despite voters’ disenchantment with the political developments of the past eight years , the current efforts to prosecute Ahmadinejad in criminal court are not necessarily welcomed as signs of a return to order .
“
On the one hand , I ’m aware of the fraud he perpetrated against us and wish him to be prosecuted , for any reason , ” says Mojgan , 40 , a housewife .
But , she adds that if Ahmadinejad was to be tried , it should be on the basis of financial corruption .
“
The image of a person who was once the president of this country should not be besmirched .
” Rather than targeting his financial mismanagement , the main charges lodged against the former president are of a bureaucratic nature .
Ahmadinejad is accused of failing to set the structure of the National Iranian Oil Company , delaying the operation of the ministry of youth and sports , and failing to set a budget for the country ’s metro system .
However , reformist newspapers have noted that that the complaints against Ahmadinejad are not limited to these three violations .
His case features nine different plaintiffs , according to members of the Iranian parliament ’s government oversight committee , and the charges range from causing “ high mortality rates on the nation ’s highways ” to spending lavishly during his last trip to the UN general assembly in New York City last year .
Yet another charge involves parliament speaker Ali Larijani , whom Ahmadinejad attempted to discredit after Larijani led impeachment proceedings against him last winter .
During his appearance in parliament , Ahmedinejad played a controversial video tape in which Larijani appeared to solicit a bribe from Saeed Mortazavi , then the head of the social welfare organization .
That afternoon , the parliament speaker ’s brother , Fazel Larijani , filed a judicial complaint against Ahmadinejad and Mortazavi for the “ dissemination of falsehoods , ” and said that he would pursue the case until final redress .
Ahmadinejad and his supporters have questioned both the constitutionality and fairness of the accusations , claiming the case was an “ insult to the feelings of millions of Iranians .
”
His refusal to attend the start of the trial in Tehran 26 November did not surprise local observers , who noted that the maverick politician may have dodged the public appearance to avoid public embarrassment .
“
If Ahmadinejad was certain that his appearance in court would lead to controversy and the unrest of social forces , he would have appeared , ” a Tehran political analyst told Tehran Bureau .
“
The truth is that he does n’t have his past popularity .
People are forgetting him .
”
Though Ahmadinejad has lost many of his former supporters , some remain concerned that political obscurity may make him a convenient scapegoat for those still at the levers of power .
Delving into the available court documents related to the case , local newspapers have noted that several of the complaints have been signed by private individuals with no public service record , making it difficult to determine exactly who stands behind the prosecutions .
If the legal proceedings against him continue , Ahmadinejad would become the first president of the Islamic republic to stand trial for actions he took while in office .
However , there are indications that not everyone in the establishment is interested in seeing this happen .
Gathering on the steps of the central Tehran courthouse on the day of the trial , a small core of Ahmadinejad supporters recited Al Yassin , a Shia prayer calling on the Mahdi to return .
It was reportedly a pitiful showing compared to the crowds he used to conjure , but the notoriously unpredictable former president may still have a political ace up his sleeve .
During the Ashura mourning ceremonies two weeks ago , Ahmadinejad made an appearance at the house of Khamenei , who has in past months made efforts to calm the divided political scene by calling on the judiciary to halt related prosecutions against one of Ahmadinejad ’s former deputies .
In public photos from the event , Ahmadinejad was once again seated at the supreme leader ’s right - hand side .

2014-05-04,"The Iranian president , Hassan Rouhani , is facing growing criticism from a broad array of political hardliners and rightwing opponents who say his government is being duped by the US in an over - hasty attempt to clinch a nuclear deal with the west and end economic sanctions .
At a meeting at the former American embassy building in central Tehran on Saturday , a newly formed group of MPs and rightwing activists calling itself "" We 're Worried "" claimed Iran 's negotiating team was ignoring national interests in the nuclear talks , which resume on 13 May in Vienna . ""
The whole nation believes the main intention of the United States is to fully halt the Iranian nuclear programme , "" said Fatemeh Alia , a central committee member of the hardline Islamic Revolution Resistance Front , previously allied to the former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
"" Since the beginning of the drafting of the final nuclear agreement with Iran is scheduled for 13 May this year , the analysts , the university students , the elites , and the university professors wish to express their worries to the [ Iranian ] nuclear negotiators hoping that they would heed such concerns , "" Alia told the official news agency Irna .
Despite an interim agreement in Geneva last November that granted Tehran limited sanctions relief in return for a slowing of its nuclear programme , no cracks had appeared in the international sanctions regime , Alia said .
Meanwhile the US had made additional demands concerning human rights and Iran 's missile stockpile .
Alia said the Rouhani government should stop treating its critics as "" illiterates "" .
Esmaˈeil Kowsari , another MP , said the whole nation wanted an end to the nuclear standoff with the west , but the cost could be too high . ""
The main point in these negotiations is maintaining the balance in implementation of both sides ' commitments , which needs to be observed while preserving the interests and rights of the Iranian nation , "" Kowsari said .
The world powers had not shown the same "" honesty "" as Iran in abiding by their commitments , he said .
Pressure on Rouhani has been building in recent weeks as the likelihood of a deal has grown .
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader and a staunch religious conservative , has backed the president 's negotiation policy but made clear that certain red lines can not be crossed .
To appease rightwingers , he has ordered a review of the negotiators ' performance .
"" I agreed to the government 's initiative to negotiate , just to break the hype , "" Khamenei said in a speech last month marking national nuclear technology day .
But Iran would continue to resist the designs of the "" Global Arrogance "" , he said , referring to the US . ""
The activities of the Islamic Republic in the area of nuclear research and development will not stop in any way .
None of the nuclear achievements of the country can be given up , "" , Khamenei said .
As a fallback , Khamenei continues to argue that sanctions can be rendered ineffective by increased economic self - sufficiency and by attracting investment from non - western partners such as China .
The US and Britain have expressed guarded confidence that a final nuclear deal with Iran can be reached by the deadline of 20 July , describing the talks as "" very substantive "" .
Rouhani and his chief negotiator , Mohammad Javad Zarif , have echoed those sentiments .
"" Iran is optimistic about the results of the talks and has taken great steps to reach a comprehensive deal and aims to achieve a win - win result , "" Rouhani told Iranian television last week .
Rouhani hit back angrily at his critics . ""
Through lies and hype some people are trying to derail the government from its path , and this is against national interests and the leader 's order …
Iran does not compromise on the people 's interests , "" he said .
Part of the pressure on Rouhani stems not from public concern about the nitty - gritty of the nuclear deal but from entrenched partisan opposition to his new centrist government , which took office last year after defeating the conservative and rightwing principlist factions that dominated political life during the Ahmadinejad years .
Rouhani 's main electoral pledge was to improve the economy .
The lifting of sanctions is key to that objective , and has become more critical in the past nine months as economic conditions have deteriorated for most Iranians .
The rightwing opposition , which believes Rouhani is tainted by reformist ideas , claims his policy is failing , while popular support appears to be dropping .
Amir Mohebbian , an influential rightwing writer , government insider and founder of the traditionalist Modern Thinkers party , said the conservative opposition believed Rouhani had "" accepted the ideals and standards of the west before the negotiations even began "" .
While the battle played out between the two sides , Khamenei was straddling the fence and could yet jump either way , Mohebbian told the Guardian . ""
The supreme leader trusts Rouhani and Zarif in general but not in every case .
There are red lines .
We will not be bullied .
The leader has said Iran will be flexible .
But he is telling the radicals that the negotiators do not have a free hand , they do not have the final word .
This is also a message to the west not to push too hard . ""
The Obama administration is still increasing the pressure by raising human rights and missiles .
The US is looking for other problems .
If the west thinks by pressure and isolation they can force Iran to do what they want , it is making a very bad mistake , "" he said .
"" It would be better for the western countries to make a deal by the 20 July deadline , but it would not be a problem for Iran if the deadline was missed . """
2014-06-11,"They never spoke , they were playing instruments that are little known to British audiences , and they only performed one instrumental piece , which lasted for more than an hour .
But this was an intense , memorable and almost exhaustingly emotional set .
Kayhan Kalhor is one of Iran 's greatest musicians , an exponent of the kamancheh "" spike fiddle "" , and he was joined by Ali Bahrami Fard on the bass santur – a hammered dulcimer – for their latest version of I Will Not Stand Alone , a largely improvised piece that was influenced by the mass protests that accompanied the 2009 re - election of the former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Kalhor has since moved to the US .
The duo performed , kneeling , on a low platform covered in an exquisite Persian carpet .
The piece began with a sad , sturdy theme from the santur and then the brooding , mournful kamancheh joined in , first plucked , then bowed .
From then on , the music , and mood , constantly changed .
There were patches of unexpected silence , followed by sudden , furious fiddle lines and improvisation in which Kalhor played with his eyes shut , grey hair flopping over his face .
Then the mood altered again , with exuberant , rapid - fire playing as the two musicians swapped solos almost by intuition .
This was followed by yet another switch , to a more lyrical and gentle passage , before this extraordinary piece reached an upbeat and defiantly cheerful conclusion .
The Iranians were rightly billed as headliners of this Songlines Encounters festival show , but they came on first , which was tough on the excellent Çiğdem Aslan , who had to follow them .
She is a Turkish Kurd based in London , lead singer with She'Koyokh and a soloist specialising in rebetika .
Her impressive set included often jaunty , sad - edged songs from Turkey , Greece and Kurdistan , but inevitably sounded easy - going after the emotional onslaught from Kalhor and Fard ."
2014-09-23,"Every September , Iranian leaders take a week - long visit , which they hate to miss , to the country ’s nemesis – the United States .
As the UN general assembly gathers for its annual meeting in New York , an array of media events , high - profile TV interviews and public meetings await the much - anticipated arrival of the representatives of the Islamic Republic .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the former president , was a frequent visitor .
In his eight years in office he made nine trips to New York , exploiting every opportunity available to generate controversy – not least for his Holocaust denials .
For his last visit , Ahmadinejad took more than 100 allies and their relatives with him and returned to criticism at home for the size of his entourage .
Since last year , however , Iran has had a new public image :
Hassan Rouhani .
The smiling cleric made history in 2013 when he spoke to Barack Obama on the phone on the last day of his UN trip .
Although that visit fell short of a historic handshake between the two leaders , it marked a milestone – the first direct contact between Iranian and US presidents in more than three decades .
But this year , Rouhani ’s second visit to New York has been marred by a series of failures at home that have exposed his declining credibility both in Iran and on the world stage .
As he arrives in New York , Iran ’s judiciary , which operates independently of his government , has tightened its grip on civil rights advocates , human rights activists and opposition figures .
At least three American nationals remain behind bars in Iran , including the Washington Post ’s Tehran correspondent , Jason Rezaian , who is being kept in Tehran ’s Evin prison nearly two months after being arrested .
Rezaian ’s detention has exposed the limits of Rouhani ’s power and his reluctance to speak out in support of prisoners of conscience in the country , including nearly 40 journalists and bloggers .
In contrast to last year when the judiciary released a number of high - profile activists to give Rouhani more legitimacy abroad , this time it has shown little appetite for such gestures .
In fact , a series of arrests of activists in recent months point to a rise in human rights abuses .
Last week alone , it emerged that a Tehran court had handed down suspended sentences of 91 lashes and six - months’ imprisonment to seven Iranians for a video showing them dancing to Pharrell Williams ’s hit song
Happy on the rooftops of Tehran .
Another case is the imprisonment of Ghoncheh Ghavami , a 25-year - old British - Iranian woman , who is still being held because she wanted to enter big sporting events alongside male fans .
Iran has a longstanding ban on women attending stadiums if men are present .
After a year in office , Rouhani has evidently put an end to Ahmadinejad ’s years of rancour .
The economic mismanagement of Ahmadinejad ’s era is being steadily reversed but Rouhani has done little to fulfil his many other promises , especially for greater social freedoms and protection of human rights .
In particular , there has been little improvement in the situation of the country ’s ailing opposition leaders , Mir Hossein Mousavi , his wife Zahra Rahnavard and Mehdi Karroubi .
They are still kept under house arrest without being put on trial or being able to challenge their detention in court .
Promises as simple as free access to Facebook and Twitter are up in the air and greater access to a number of internet messaging sites such as WhatsApp and Viber is being challenged .
This week , Iran ’s judiciary gave an ultimatum to Rouhani ’s government to block those services within a month .
International relations is one of the few areas where Rouhani seems to have made some advances .
Tehran and Washington , in spite of their historically strained ties , talk to each other regularly now .
Iran is trying to improve relations with Britain and significant steps have been taken on the nuclear issue , led by the foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , although a permanent agreement still looks far off .
But even with the nuclear talks , the pronouncements of Iran ’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and the constraints laid down by him has shown how tied Rouhani ’s hands are , showing more than ever who is in charge of Iran ’s foreign policy .
Despite this , Rouhani faces huge domestic challenges .
The worry is that the president has shown little desire , at least in public , to tackle the challenges posed by Iranian hardliners , but unless he is prepared to get to grips with them , he risks being seen as a weak leader whose very legitimacy is in question ."
2014-11-17,"The first thing you see when you walk through the blackened wrought - iron gates are the stony faces of Osama bin Laden , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and other historical figures staring out from a graffiti - covered wall at a scene of utter devastation .
Welcome to the Abode of Chaos , a sprawling outdoor contemporary art museum near Lyon in France .
It is a place in which all references to the seemingly ordered and structured world outside are obliterated .
And that is precisely the reason why some people would like to see it shut down .
Burnt - out cars , oil barrels , silver painted truck engines and mannequins that look like dead bodies are strewn around the ground .
Look left , and you ’ll see a damaged military helicopter tilted on its side , a yellow tank that pokes its menacing gun barrel out from a tall hedge , and an aircraft with no landing gear lies on top of a mound of earth and black gravel with the words
“
Let ’s be cruel ” daubed crudely on the side of the fuselage .
Chains hang from gantries , twisted cables are everywhere , grotesquely bent steel girders and strange metallic structures abound .
The Abode of Chaos is the brainchild of Thierry Ehrmann , a freemason , artist and businessman .
It is situated in the sleepy village of Saint - Romain - au - Mont - d’Or , near Lyon .
Ehrmann himself lives on the site in a large house , the walls of which are covered in slogans , graffiti , images of historical figures and mysterious logos.“I’m trying to ‘ de - legendise’ the world , ” he says , when I ask him how he sees his work .
“
Janus said that chaos preceded the divine .
He was right , and the world is constantly renewing itself , constructing and deconstructing itself .
”
He goes on to explain that his project , which began to take shape in the 1980s , “ began as research into alchemy and the regeneration of matter and has evolved ever since ” .
The abode ’s three or four in - house artists can often be seen working on new ideas , the most recent of which is a reconstruction of Yasser Arafat ’s funeral .
A 10 metre - wide by 3 metre - high structure , it consists of upright , bent and rusting metal girders with piping attached to the top of each one that snakes haphazardly overhead and into the epicentre of the piece , where Arafat is represented by brightly coloured girders .
The back garden is dominated by a haunting reconstruction of the remains of the World Trade Centre , and a massive metal bunker stands next to a truck with a cutting mechanism attached to the front that contains the charred remains of mannequins mixed with black tar .
A burnt - out oil truck marked “
Halliburton ” stands as a silent witness to what feeds conflict .
The constant bombardment of images of chaos and disorder explains why some visitors consider the museum to be a disturbing or even unhealthy place .
Children and young people are generally fascinated by the exhibits , however , and they arrive in large numbers ( and for free ) when the museum – which was visited by 120,000 people last year – is open .
Needless to say , the Abode has not gone unnoticed by the inhabitants of the village – and the mayor and others have been trying in vain to get it shut down for years .
Ehrmann knows this , and shrugs his shoulders resignedly .
“
They will never stop trying ,
” he sighs , before going on to remind me of the excavated area in the grounds which contains the remains of a temple in which a massacre of Protestants is said to have been carried out in 1630 .
“
That drives the mayor nuts !
” he says .
The constant attempts to have the museum shut down seem designed to muzzle artistic expression , a trend that appears to have gathered pace over the last few years , in France as elsewhere .
The recent attack on Paul McCarthy ’s “ butt plug ” statue in Paris comes to mind , as do the 2012 defacing of a Mark Rothko mural and the attempts earlier this year to get the Exhibit B show at the Barbican withdrawn .
Freedom of expression means allowing everyone to express their views within the limits of the law , and is to be fiercely protected from attack .
Those who seek to stifle or defile the work of others should be condemned , as their actions are no more than an attempt to censor others .
The Abode of Chaos is a challenging environment which asks fundamental questions about the nature of change and chaos in our world , a world of flux and a constant cycle of upheaval and regeneration .
We need places like this , and if ever you are near Lyon it would be well worth taking the time to visit it .
Oh , and do n’t forget to bring the kids ."
2014-11-18,"Nearly ten years ago , a story circulating in Tehran had Mohammad Khatami say of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , his successor as president , “
No matter how extreme you are , you will always be in a queue behind Ousama [ bin Laden ] .
”
This may well have been an urban folk tale , but it highlighted a fear that Ahmadinejad ’s assertive Shi’ism was not in Iran ’s best interests .
Rather than spread Iranian influence , unleash a revolution of the world ’s dispossessed , or liberate Jerusalem from the Israelis , Iranian radicalism carried the danger of a backlash from Sunnis Muslims , who are around 80 % of the world ’s 1.6 billion Muslims , while Shia are 10 - 15 % and a majority in only Iran , Iraq , Azerbaijan and Bahrain .
Is that nightmare now becoming real ?
Today the Islamic State ( Isis ) , which regards Shia as infidels and has killed thousands , is barely kilometres from the Iranian border in Iraq ’s Diyala province .
But if the rapid rise of Isis to the west has alarmed the Iranian public , there are also developments to its east .
Several Pakistan Taliban commanders have declared their loyalty to Isis , including former spokesman Shahidullah Shahid .
There are reports of Isis establishing an affiliate , Ansar - ul Daulat - e Islamia fil Pakistan , and luring recruits from two Sunni militant groups , Lashkar - e Jhangvi and Ahl - e Sunnat Wai Jamat .
For 30 years , Pakistan has been a centre of a brand of Sunni extremism , related to Saudi Wahhabism , that considers Shia apostates .
Violence against Shia has killed thousands in recent years .
In Baluchistan , neighbouring Iran , eight Shia were taken from a bus in October and gunned down in Quetta , the provincial capital .
A Human Rights Watch report in June highlighted a litany of atrocities against Shia , especially against ethnic Hazara in Baluchistan province , that have killed many hundreds in recent years , including two bombings in Quetta in 2013 in which at least 180 died .
It is not easy for Iran to isolate its own territory .
Around 10 million Baluchis straddle
Iran ’s Sistan - Baluchistan and Pakistan ’s Baluchistan , both poor provinces with widespread drug smuggling .
Last year Iran executed 16 members of Jundallah , which had carried attacks on Iranian security forces , mixing Baluchi nationalism with al - Qaeda style practices including beheadings , and declared its insurrection over .
But a new group , Jaish al - Adl , appeared and in February captured five border guards , provoking a drawn - out crisis that provoked major social media activity among alarmed Iranians before mediation by the main Sunni leader in Sistan - Baluchistan , Abdul - Hamid Esmaeel - Zehi , secured the release of four .
Iran fears both that the United States and Saudi Arabia have encouraged Jundallah , alleging when it captured and hanged its 27-year - old leader Abdul - Malik Rigi in 2010 that he had visited the US air base in Bagram , Afghanistan , shortly before his capture .
The New York Times has recently offered new evidence of US intelligence involvement with the group .
Iran is also aware of collusion between sections of Pakistani security – especially Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) – with militant Sunni groups , which goes back at least to both Saudi and Pakistani intelligence fuelling jihad against Russia in Afghanistan in the 1980s .
Hence the limits of last year ’s bilateral agreement with Pakistan to co - operate against crime and security threats were exposed by several weeks of recent border tensions .
In October , Tehran warned Pakistan after militants killed at least four Iranian soldiers or border guards , and then reportedly crossed the border ( 17 October ) and , according to Pakistan , killed one and wounded three border guards .
This culminated , a few days later , with the two sides’ armed forces exchanging mortar fire and the dispatch of a deputy Iranian foreign minister for urgent talks .
Pakistani officials have denied Iran ’s claims that insurgents use Pakistan as a base , with some arguing unrest has its origins in legitimate Baluchi resentment .
With support growing for Isis , this is no time to be “ soft ” on Shia Iran .
But for Iran , the Baluchi make a Sunni - Shia conflict domestic .
Inside Iran , Sunnis are around 10 % of the country
’s 78 million people and are mainly ethnic Baluchi or Kurds .
Extreme Sunni militancy has made far less headway among the Kurds than among the Baluchi , partly due to the influence of Sufism and the strength of pre - Islamic Kurdish culture , but a growth in Kurdish nationalism caused by both Syrian and Iraqi Kurds fighting Isis has its own implications for Iran ’s 8 million Kurds .
But in any case , all Iran ’s
Sunnis allege discrimination in government employment and investment , and begrudge the absence of a Sunni mosque in Tehran and the common naming of buildings and streets in Sunni provinces after Shia leaders .
President Hassan Rouhani has promised to address the grievances of both ethnic and religious minorities .
In last year ’s presidential election , he did better in Kordistan province ( which is not all of the mainly Kurdish region ) with 71 % and Sistan - Baluchestan ( of which Sistan is mainly Shia ) with 73 % compared to 51 % nationally .
But delivery is far from easy , as Mohammad Khatami found when he made similar promises .
While there is political opposition to reform both among Shia clerics and the political class , Iranian security favours “ strategic depth ” , whereby border provinces are heavily militarised to create a buffer , an approach that can fuel resentment as much as improve security .
In terms of politics , Iranian leaders have been at pains to deny there is a regional battle between Shia and Sunnis and to argue that Sunni militants should be distinguished from the wider Sunni community .
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the supreme leader , has called several times in recent months for Muslim unity .
He told Iranian hajj officials in late October that the “ ummah should n’t practise hostility towards each other , but should support each other over important global issues ” .
But does at least some hostility towards Shia – and therefore rise of militant Sunni groups – stem from the behaviour of Iran and its allies ?
The 2003 US - led invasion of Iraq unnerved the Sunni - led states , especially Saudi Arabia , by creating a new , Shia - led order in Baghdad that Iran welcomed .
In 2008 , Hezbollah ’s military assertion in west Beirut , in response to a Sunni - led government challenging its security role at the airport , alienated “ moderate Sunnis ” .
Above all , by 2012 the Syrian war appeared clearly sectarian as an Iranian - backed , Allawi - led regime confronted mainly Sunni rebels .
Since Isis took Mosul in June , Iran ’s approach in Iraq has been rooted in Shia solidarity .
Nouri al - Maliki , Iraqi vice - president and as former prime minister widely blamed for alienating Iraq ’s Sunnis , was recently in Iran to improve what he called “ mutual co - operation ” against “ Takfiri terrorists ” .
Shia militia leaders in Iraq have been quoted extolling the role of Qassem Soleimani , the head of the al - Quds section of Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards , to the extent of leading a front - line operation in the recapture of Jurf al - Sakher from Isis , shunning a flak jacket in the process .
Human Rights Watch has documented abuses both by mainly Iraqi Shia government forces and by Shia militias ( it has described the two as “ indistinguishable ” ) .
After the killing of 34 civilians in a mosque in Diyala province in August , Joe Stork , HRW regional director noted : “ Iraqi authorities and Iraq ’s allies alike have ignored this horrific attack and then they wonder why the militant group Islamic State has had such appeal among Sunni communities .
”"
2015-04-06,"In its eight - decade history , the Tehran Symphony Orchestra has ridden out some turbulent events : a western - engineered coup that overthrew the democratically elected prime minister in the 1950s , the Islamic revolution , and war with Iraq .
Under the country ’s previous president , the hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , this once glamorous music institution experienced one of its darkest periods when it was disbanded due to negligence by officials and financial stringency .
But now , the culture ministry has hired a world - class conductor and it is rising from the ashes nearly three years after it was shut down .
Last month musicians took to the stage as Beethoven ’s Symphony
No 9 filled Tehran ’s Vahdat hall at the opening ceremony .
“
I walked on to the stage and the audience rose to its feet , ” said Alexander Rahbari , the principal conductor .
“
I ’ve performed for 40 years outside Iran and never seen a standing ovation before the performance .
This was something totally different .
It showed what having the orchestra back meant to them .
I was close to tears .
”
The front row was filled with dignitaries and senior officials , an indication of the support the new Iranian administration is throwing behind the group .
Only President Hassan Rouhani was absent , due to other commitments .
But his first deputy , the culture minister and a group of foreign ambassadors and high - profile politicians and artists were in attendance .
For an ensemble that had not performed in such a long time , Beethoven ’s masterpiece was challenging , but Rahbari was determined they could deliver .
“
Symphony
No 9 was only performed once for seven nights in the past 40 years , so when I told them we were going to perform that , they were in shock , ” he said .
He added : “ When musicians want to do something , they can do magic .
”
The group is all - Iranian – 87 musicians and 70 choir singers , who performed the Ode to Joy in its original German .
After the performance , the Dutch ambassador in Tehran , Jos Douma , tweeted : “ Rahbari , orchestra and choir did a terrific job .
”
The president , too , thanked them on Twitter .
Rahbari , the Iranian - born music leader who has spent most of his life in Austria , is internationally known and has conducted more than 120 European orchestras , including the Berlin Philharmonic and London Philharmonic .
Now 66 , he first conducted the Tehran Symphony Orchestra some 40 years ago under the late shah ’s rule when the institution was in its heyday , hosting the likes of violinist Yehudi Menuhin and choreographer Maurice Béjart .
He left Iran a few years before the 1979 revolution because he believed the then authorities were only interested in big names and were neglecting the group ’s Iranian core .
He did not return for 30 years – and then only briefly , leaving again after Ahmadinejad was elected .
Within a few years , the orchestra , whose members earned as little as a taxi driver , had closed down .
“
Now , it ’s a completely different story , ” he said .
“
We have a unique opportunity that we ’ve never had before .
He added that he is particularly delighted that the support comes from a president who is a cleric .
Iran ’s clerical community have at times been at odds with music , especially in the early years of the 1979 revolution .
But Rouhani promised to revive the Tehran Symphony Orchestra after being elected to office in 2013 .
“
He has given a new life to the orchestra , ” Rahbari said .
“
It is particularly important that he has done so at a time when the country is still suffering from unjust western sanctions .
”
From next week , the orchestra will perform four big concerts a month , including Beethoven ’s ninth every other week .
Rahbari wants to train a new generation of Iranian conductors and will bring western operas , such as Sister Angelica , to Iran for the first time , presenting them in Persian .
Despite the welcome he has received , Rahbari has not been immune to attacks from hardliners , who have previously condemned him as a western spy .
In fact , fundamentalists and hawks have been vocal against the culture ministry ’s new efforts and have managed to sabotage a number of recent concerts .
Hardliners are particularly sensitive towards women singing solo , which is still banned in Iran .
They are only permitted to sing while accompanied by male singers .
“ Our religion is full of music , look at Ta’zieh [ a kind of religious condolence theatre ] or even reading the Qur’an
, there ’s music in that , ” Rahbari said .
“
When I was a kid , I used to play Mozart .
One day my traditional Iranian mum went to see the local mullah , asking him : ‘ My son is playing someone called Mozzzar , is that OK?’
The cleric responded : ‘ I do n’t know Mr Mozzzar in person
but I ’ve heard good things about him .
I ’m sure he ’ll be fine , ” he recalled .
Rahbari said in his 40-year career , his biggest wish is yet to come true .
“
I ’ve performed in almost all major European cities but I wish one day I can take my own country ’s symphony orchestra to one of these places , like London or Berlin , ” he said .
“
That day is not far off . ”"
2015-04-29,"In over three decades of animosity between Iran and its arch enemy , the US , so much has been lost in translation .
For instance , after Iran ’s former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad caused outrage by reportedly saying that Israel should be “ wiped off the map
”
, it emerged that his words had not been accurately translated by his own state news agency .
In fact , analysts said , Ahmadinejad meant that Israel will collapse over time ; it was a prediction , not a call for war .
Today , with nuclear negotiations producing promising outcomes , the longstanding taboo in the Islamic Republic against talking directly with American officials is history .
Not since the 1979 revolution have Tehran and Washington had such a good understanding of each other ’s positions and values .
This is partly thanks to an American diplomat who communicates directly with the people of Iran .
Alan Eyre , the US State Department ’s Persian language spokesperson , enjoys near - celebrity status in Iran due to his impressive knowledge of Iranian literature .
Eyre , who speaks formal Farsi , often flavours his responses with a handful of ancient Persian expressions and a line of poetry to get his message across .
That resonates with many in Iran .
“
This job , for me , has been a real pleasure because it has allowed for me to learn more about Iran , to interact with Iranians and try to get America ’s message to Iranians , ” he told the Guardian .
“
One of the problems is that just like many Americans perhaps have a skewed vision of Iran , I think a lot of Iranians , perhaps for a variety of reasons , have a vision of America that is quite inaccurate .
So to the extent I can rectify or correct that or present a more realistic vision of America to Iranians , that ’s the goal .
” Eyre , a former head of the Iran desk at the US consulate in Dubai , was appointed as a Persian language spokesperson in 2011 .
It was part of Barack Obama ’s attempt to reach out to Iranians while relations were deteriorating under Ahmadinejad .
Obama has issued regular messages on the occasion of the Persian new year , Nowruz , speaking directly to Iranians via YouTube videos .
Iran itself has a US - educated , English - speaking foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , who is in New York this week .
He communicates with the American people directly through his Twitter account , newspaper articles , television interviews and public roundtables , including one at New America on Wednesday .
The US secretary of state , John Kerry , has by now spent more time with Zarif than any other foreign minister .
They call each other John and Javad .
In a recent interview with the New York Times , Obama demonstrated how far America has come in understanding and acknowledging the mutual mistrust between Tehran and Washington .
In comments the likes of which have rarely been heard from an American president , Obama said : “ Part of the psychology of Iran is rooted in past experiences , the sense that their country was undermined , that the United States or the west meddled in first their democracy [ overthrowing the democratically elected prime minister in 1950s ] and then in supporting the Shah – and then in supporting Iraq [ in its war against Iran ] and Saddam during that extremely brutal war .

Ever since Hassan Rouhani ’s election re - energised nuclear negotiations , Eyre has been part of the US delegation to the talks .
This has put him in direct contact with the Iranian media .
Though at first he mainly talked to the exiled Iranian media outlets , such as the BBC ’s Persian language service , he now frequently speaks to state news agencies or websites operating inside Iran .
Eyre has become a familiar face among Iranians .
His Facebook page has attracted more than 100,000 likes .
He is also on Twitter and Instagram and has an “ Ask Alan ” initiative through social media , which allows Iranians to raise any questions .
He is often bombarded with questions about nuclear issues , visa matters or when sanctions might end .
In the absence of an American embassy in Tehran , the US has launched a virtual Iranian embassy online .
His popularity may , Eyre said , be “ because I have shown there are American diplomats who have real love for Iran , love for the culture , love for the language ” .
People particularly like Eyre ’s references to Persian poetry , from great poets such as Saadi , Hafez , Khayam and Rumi .
“
I have a little black book .
I carry around bits of poetry that I like that resonates most with me .
If I have a spare moment , I open it up and reread it .
” Eyre studied literature at college , where he was interested in Sufi poetry .
That was when he began to learn Persian .
“
I wanted to see what it would be like to read them in original , ” he said .
Iran ’s huge diaspora in Los Angeles also came to his help .
Today he has an important role in Iran - US relations .
“
One of the things I try to do is to inform people higher up – the White House , people at National Security Council , people at uppermost level of the state department – what I hear and my sense from the feedback I get from Iranians .
”
In a recent post , Eyre expressed condolences to Rouhani on the occasion of his mother ’s death .
Kerry had also issued a similar message .
“
Thanks to you and Mr Kerry , it shows how America ’s attitude to Iran has become more respectful and friendly , ” one Iranian user commented beneath Eyre ’s Facebook post .
Not everyone agrees .
On a post Eyre shared in objection to the ongoing detention of the Washington Post ’s reporter in Iran , Jason Rezaian , one user said : “ You should first shut down Guantanamo Bay before interfering in the judicial matters of an independent country .
”
Eyre said he does not know if a nuclear deal would lead to the re - opening of American and Iranian embassies in each others’ capitals .
But he said he hopes that one day he will be able to visit Iran – a country he has never visited .
“
I ’d like to go to Iran .
This is a country I ’ve focused on over thirty years both personally and professionally , so of course , it ’d be one of the thrills of my life to finally go to one of the places I ’d read about for so long . ”"
2015-07-14,"Iran ’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has weathered some critical moments over the last quarter of a century - the US - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 when Tehran feared it would be the next target , the disputed re - election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad which shook the legitimacy of his rule and the acrimonious years that followed as sanctions hit the country ’s economy .
Perhaps the biggest decision of his career , however , was the one he had to make this week .
The historic deal struck in Vienna could not have happened without Khameni ’s blessing .
He has the final say in all state matters in Iran and his decision may define his leadership .
On one side of the negotiating table of the 22-month talks sat seven parties struggling to secure a formula that would allow a comprehensive nuclear agreement with Tehran , which will have profound implications for the Middle East .
On the other side , there was one man not actually present but whose view was decisive .
No one doubted who that person was .
Khamenei knows only too well the weight his verdict carries .
He wants to go down in history as the man who persuaded the west and the US in particular to “ recognise
the Islamic republic ’s right to a peaceful nuclear programme ” against all odds , and despite numerous UN security council resolutions demanding a complete halt to its nuclear activities .
He is determined not to be cast as the leader who yielded to sanctions and drank from the “ poisoned chalice ” , a term Khamenei ’s predecessor Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini used when he agreed to sign a UN - brokered truce to end the country ’s eight - year war with Iraq in 1988 .
That conflict was the longest conventional war of the last century and cost 500,000 Iranian lives .
Many in Khomeini ’s inner circle opposed making peace , arguing that the “ sacred defence ” had to continue until Saddam ’s rule collapsed .
In the end , however , pragmatism prevailed and Khomeini heeded the moderate forces .
Khomeini died shortly after accepting the truce , and a year later Khamenei , then the country ’s president , was elevated to the life - time position of supreme leader .
He was left with the daunting task of steering Iran through the difficult post - war era .
This week , Khamenei found himself in a similar position to his predecessor .
Just as during the war with Iraq , two major forces are at play within Iran .
One opposed compromise with “ the enemy ” and sees the deal as a humiliation for Tehran , while the other , made up of reformists and moderates , wanted an end to the nuclear saga .
Once again , Iran ’s leader found himself caught between the two forces .
In the months before the agreement , many hardliners warned that moderates were forcing Khamenei to drink from the “ poisoned chalice ” .
“
Whether we like Khamenei or not , whether we consider him as a dictator or a dear leader , he has quite successfully managed to keep Iran stable in a volatile region struck by war and instability , ” Ali Alizadeh , an Iranian analyst based in London , said .
“
The talk of drinking from a poisoned chalice is something that is uttered from both internal and external hardliners who want to portray this deal as a defeat for Khamenei , which I think is a mistake .
”
Alizadeh described Khamenei as a classic conservative in the same mould as Henry Kissinger , “ whose main concern in the past 14 years since the beginning of 2000s has been to secure the stability of the Islamic republic ” .
“
He may well have just achieved that , and this agreement will change the paradigm from Washington to Riyadh , heralding a new era in the Middle East and international relations , ” he said ."
2015-07-21,"‘ US Soothes Upset Netanyahu With Shipment of Ballistic Missiles’ sounds like a headline from the Onion .
And it is – except that this time it ’s true .
International media organisations have regularly been caught out by the satirical news site , fooled into thinking that Kim Jong - un really was voted the world ’s sexiest man , or that Americans would prefer a beer with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad than Barack Obama .
But this time editors of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz were spooked by a story in the Onion from the previous day that matched what they had heard as fact .
Last week , the paper reported a senior US official as saying that Obama had spoken to the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , offering to “ begin immediate talks about upgrading the Israel Defence Forces’ offensive and defensive capabilities ” after US negotiators reached a deal on Iran ’s nuclear programme , which was condemned by Israel .
But the day before , the Onion had published a tongue - in - cheek piece announcing that the Israeli government would receive “ a nice , big shipment of ballistic missiles ” to help them come to terms with the Iran deal .
The piece included jokey quotes from a “ State Department spokesperson ” , which said : “ Bibi always gets a little cranky when he sees us talking to Iran , but a few dozen short - range surface - to - surface missiles usually cheer him right up
…
At least we ’ll have a couple months of peace and quiet around here .
”
Life does not entirely imitate satire : Haaretz reported that the Israeli leader has said he would not accept the offer , because to do so would imply that the Iran deal had been tacitly accepted , though Israeli army radio on Monday quoted unnamed defence ministry officials as saying they would discuss compensation from the US .
The US defence secretary , Ashton Carter , met Netanyahu in Israel on Tuesday for talks before travelling on to Jordan and Saudi Arabia .
The United States grants the country about $ 3bn ( £ 1.9bn ) in military aid annually , and also spends on other equipment , such as Israel ’s Iron Dome missile defence system ."
2015-08-14,"Ebrahim Asgharzadeh ’s plan to take over the US embassy in Tehran on Sunday 4 November 1979 had been carefully choreographed .
The ardent revolutionary , a bright student in his early 20s , had been careful to confide in just four other student leaders .
One , a young man with the long hair and beard of a Latin American student leader , was called Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Although Ahmadinejad – who later become Iran ’s most controversial president – opposed
Asgharzadeh ’s idea , none of the quartet betrayed his confidence , and his plot went ahead .
Inside the embassy ’s well - guarded compound in central Tehran , a 36-year - old American diplomat , fluent in Farsi and with a passion for Persian poetry , was working in his consular office .
From his desk , John Limbert could hear the students chanting “ Death to America ” in the street outside .
But he was not nervous , assuming it was just another revolutionary rally .
By 10.30am he realised how wrong he was , as he stood next to weeping , shaking colleagues just behind the two - floor building ’s main door .
Outside , the students had climbed up the gate and broken into the mission .
Now they were shattering the basement windows and climbing inside .
Despite fearing for his life , Limbert volunteered to speak to the crowds .
Stepping out , with the door locking behind him , he shook hands with members of the crowd , before asking them to leave the embassy .
Desperately ad - libbing , he told them Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , the founder of the revolution , had dispatched guards to disperse them .
But within seconds Limbert was blindfolded , and his colleagues were brought out beside him .
One of the defining moments of modern Iranian history had begun ; the US hostage crisis in which 52 diplomats were held captive for 444 days .
Since that day three decades have passed .
Asgharzadeh and Limbert ’s lives are very different .
That young revolutionary is now a reformist , and in the intervening years has himself been imprisoned in solitary confinement for a month by the establishment .
The former diplomat , meanwhile , became a senior Obama administration official advising on Iran , and is now retired .
But despite their different experiences , they have one thing in common : both support the controversial nuclear agreement struck in Vienna in July , which is bringing Iran in from the cold and polarising opinions in the US .
It is hard to overestimate the shadow that the hostage crises cast over the two countries – and over relations between them .
But over the phone from Iran , Asgharzadeh tells me it is time to finally time for both sides to lay the past to rest .
“
We took the Americans hostage for 14 months , but then we became hostages of that incident for 35 years , ” he says .
“
We should put the history behind us and we should not let our future be taken hostage by our past .
”
Surprisingly , Limbert agrees that it ’s time to change the conversation , but thinks that can only be done if Iran changes its attitude .
“
The hostage crisis shaped the relationship between our countries , ” he says .
“
If you listen to the debate over the nuclear deal , the events of 1979 are very much in the background , and it does n’t help that the Islamic republic has never acknowledged what happened .
”
At the time of the revolution , anti - American sentiments were running high in Iran .
The 1953 CIA - engineered coup that overthrew Iran ’s first democractically elected prime minister , Mohammad Mosaddegh , was still fresh in Iranian minds ; the reinstatement of the Shah had as big an impact on the Iranian psyche as the hostage - taking would later have on the US .
In the meantime , the US ’s unwavering support for the Shah ’s brutal regime had stoked this animosity .
And when former US president Jimmy Carter ’s decided – a few weeks prior to the hostage crisis – to welcome the ousted Mohammad Reza Pahlavi on to American soil , many Iranians saw it as rubbing salt into the wound .
Asgharzadeh had planned to occupy the embassy , but a long - term hostage situation was never part of the plan .
Inspired by similar occupying movements in 1970s , he chose the date to coincide with the anniversary of a bloody crackdown at the hands of the Shah ’s military the year before , and with a planned student rally .
The idea was to divert this protest towards the US embassy , where unarmed students would overrun it and take diplomats prisoner , in what they thought would a symbolic act lasting no longer than 48 hours .
Blindfolding the American hostages , Asgharzadeh later admitted , was their first mistake – it immediately turned an occupying campaign into what looked like deliberate kidnapping .
Although keen to make a global impact , Asgharzadeh never imagined his actions would spark a Tehran - Washington cold war .
Today , however , Asgharzadeh is unrepentant .
Indeed , to be otherwise would be crossing a red line in Iran , where the storming of the embassy is seen as part of the revolution ’s founding mythology .
But he has been through a revolution in his own thinking , moving away from his student ideals to become an ardent reformist ; he has spent time in jail for these views .
“
Our generation had a radical and hardline view of America ’s role , ” he says today .
“
We were influenced by the trauma and nightmares of the 1953 coup .
America ’s inteference was against our national interest .
That incident belonged to a particular time – of cold war .
The world was polarised ; the US government was clearly supportive of dictatorships and military regimes , and people living in third - world countries had an unpleasant image of America in their minds .
”
The incident had the power to fell two administrations .
In Iran , the entire cabinet of the newly appointed first post - revolution prime minister , Mehdi Bazargan – a tie - wearing moderate – resigned .
While in Washington , the Carter administration was forced out when Ronald Reagan secured the release of the diplomats .
The takeover was student - engineered , but several days later , after the popular support for it became clear , it was sanctioned by the Islamic republic , who eventually took over the decision - making .
As the crises wore on , Asgharzadeh himself lost interest , turning his attention to marrying a young woman he had met during the hostage - taking .
But the event turned the students into heroes – especially when they said they had found evidence of espionage in the embassy compound by piecing together shredded documents the diplomats had tried to destroy .
Meanwhile , the hostage ’s families held vigils in the US and put up yellow ribbons , praying for their freedom .
In April 1980 , the US conducted the failed Operation Eagle Claw in an attempt to rescue the hostages .
Eight servicemen died , complicating matters further .
There is even an argument between the two sides over how the hostages were treated .
In Iran the hostages are often referred to as “ our guests
” , with the implication they were treated with hospitality .
But Limbert says he was subjected to mock executions , and was only allowed out for fresh air a few times in 14 months .
Today Limbert says that while there was mistrust on both sides , to his ears Asgharzadeh is trying to justify the unjustifiable .
“
You ca n’t undo what happened , ” Limbert says .
“
But the first step in dealing with this is to at least acknowledge that it happened , and then [ to not ] fool yourself and admit this was a shameful and ugly action .
”
The former hostage says this attitude is still prevalent among Iranian officials .
“
I get a little sad , ” he says .
“
OK , if you were a twentysomething student , maybe you can think like that , but after 35 years , someone who is older , probably a grandparent –
you would hope that they would see things in a more realistic way .
”
The Americans’ release from Iran was not an end to hostility , but merely a beginning .
In the eight - year war with Iraq that followed , the US supported Saddam Hussein , turning a blind eye to his use of chemical weapons .
In July 1988 , the US missile cruiser USS Vincennes shot down an Iranian passenger plane in the Persian Gulf , killing all 290 on board , including 66 children .
The US has never apologised .
Iran , in return , stepped up its rhetoric against the US , holding annual anti - American rallies at which “ Death to America ” was chanted and people set fire to the US flag .
America became known as “ the Great Satan ” , while the former embassy compound became a museum called “ the den of spies
” – in reference to the documents taken as evidence of US sabotage during the revolution .
“
Each side has its grievances , ” Limbert says , “ but certainly , if you ask today , nobody is going to say that shooting down the passenger plane was a good thing .
”
Limbert says the US has made efforts , including those by former secretary of state , Madeleine Albright , to acknowledge the 1953 coup ; Barack Obama has spoken about it too .
He complains that this is in stark contrast to the way the hostage crises has been commemorated .
“
No one pretends that it did n’t happen .
We do n’t mark it with celebrations , we do n’t issue stamps about it , ” he points out .
Despite the trauma he faced , Limbert , who has an Iranian wife , has never cut his ties with the country .
Every summer , around this time of the year , Limbert goes to a sour cherry orchard near his house in Virginia to make jam , a Persian tradition .
He has written books about Iran , including one about Shiraz , the city of love and poetry , named “ Shiraz in the Age of Hafez : The Glory of a Medieval Persian City
” .
Asgharzadeh says this has given him a real respect for the man he once took captive : “ John Limbert is a very positive figure in the US .
He is a friend of Iranian culture .
If the US has hundreds of John Limberts , it will only be a good thing .
”
In 2009 , when the re - election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked unrest in Iran , Limbert , who had retired in 2006 , began working for the state department .
Just 10 months later he decided to step aside , because “ there was n’t much sign of progress , and frankly , at that time , the relationship was n’t going anywhere .
I was hoping something would break .
The timing you can never predict – it should n’t have taken 35 years .
”
It was the election of the reformist Hassan Rouhani in 2013 that changed everything .
“
He became president with a mandate to help the economy , to bring Iran out of its isolation , and to all appearances in doing this he had the backing and the confidence of the supreme leader [ Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ] , ” Limbert says .
Rouhani ’s mandate was a continuation of the work of the former president Mohammad Khatami , who came to power in 1997 .
Asgharzadeh , along with other hostage - takers , was supportive of Rouhani , and he later became a reformist MP ; Massoumeh Ebtekar , who achieved fame as “ Mary ” during the hostage crisis , during which she served as the students’ English - language spokeswoman , is Iran ’s current vice - president under Rouhani .
In 2011 , when a hardline mob stormed the British embassy in Tehran , Asgharzadeh condemned the move as “ an ugly act and a caricature ” of the 1979 incident .
Rouhani ’s election sparked the first direct contact between an Iranian president and his US counterpart in more than three decades .
The thawing of relations made the deal between Iran and the world ’s six major powers over Iran ’s nucelar programme , possible – but fears remain that hardliners in Tehran and Washington , especially in the US congress , could jeopardise it before it is fully enacted .
Congress is working hard to vote it down .
Obama has vowed to veto a disapproval and even some ranking Democracts have joined opposition .
This , says Limbert , is partly because of the unresolved issue of the hostage crises .
“
As long as our Iranian friends do n’t come to terms with those events , you are going to hear the kind of debate that we ’re hearing now .
Basically , people are saying that you ca n’t make any agreement with what they call ‘ those’ people .
”
But Asgharzadeh is optmistic that this is changing , “
In Iran , people are beginning to have a more realistic image of the west , and of the US in particular .
I look at the nuclear deal as more than just an agreement .
It will have bigger impacts on Iran relations with the western world .
Taboos have been broken .
”
Limbert agrees : “ It is n’t that US and Iran are friends , but at least we have the possibility of using diplomacy , rather than just shouting at each other .
” Would both men like to see a day when embassies reopen in Tehran and Washington ?
“
Do n’t ask me to predict that , ” Limbert chuckles .
“
Before there is , there might be some American personnel in an interest section [ a de facto embassy ] – that would be the first step .
”
Asgharzadeh says : “ My wish is that Iran - west ties become normalised , and American and Iranian embassies reopen in a situation so it will not have to close again . ”"
2015-11-03,"In November 2005 I went to see Ahmad Chalabi , then Iraq ’s deputy prime minister , on the top floor of a large Tehran hotel .
It was difficult to have him focus on my questions , as both he and Zaab Sethna , his Zoroastrian Pakistani advisor , were as excited as children in poring over a huge pile of art books .
These had come from Tehran ’s Museum of Contemporary Art , which the pair had visited after president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had asked them , with their meetings finished , what they would like to see .
Chalabi had not only been aware of the museum
’s many treasures – including Picasso , Monet , Jackson Pollock and Andy Warhol
- he knew the New York dealer who had bought many of them on behalf of Farah Pahlavi , wife of the Shah .
Chalabi , who has passed away at the age of 71 , was a link to an older , more humane Iraq .
This was a more nuanced and culturally rich place than the Iraq of Saddam Hussein , Moqtada Sadr and the Islamic State ( Isis ) .
He saw no contradiction between being a proud Iraqi nationalist – who spoke even English with a heavily accented ‘ qaf’ – and a Shia with close links to Iran and Lebanon .
This made him hard , if not impossible , to understand for those who wanted to simplify the world into black and white .
When the Americans turned against him in 2004 , first with press briefings and then by raiding his Baghdad home , there was wide consternation that Chalabi possessed a Qur’an that had been a gift from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini .
Obviously , chimed much of the press , Chalabi was an Iranian spy .
I first met Chalabi in 1992 in Salahuddin , in the part of northern Iraq controlled by Kurds in the aftermath of the 1991 US - Iraq war .
Chalabi had entered Iraq through Iran , where he had been detained briefly at the border , no doubt to emphasise Tehran ’s interest .
But as the Kurds held elections , Chalabi lost no time in arguing for a new Iraqi opposition umbrella group with a closer relationship with the US .
In 1993 , he gave a lecture in the School of Oriental and African Studies , London University , on the importance of re - establishing the rule of law in Iraq : this was at the book launch of Chibli Mallat ’s study of Mohammad Baqr Sadr , the Shia cleric murdered by Saddam in 1980 .
Around that time , Chalabi also ‘ borrowed’ my copy of Victoria , the epic novel written by Sami Michael , the Iraq Jewish writer who had with some reluctance ended up in Israel .
Like Michael , Ahmad ’s daughter Tamara Chalabi evoked an older , more pluralist Iraq in her 2010 family memoir , Late for Tea at the Deer Palace , a book opening with a map of Baghdad in 1917 , a time when the city was quarter Jewish .
Tamara dedicated the book to Hassan , her uncle and Ahmad ’s elder brother , who had established the Islamic university in Lebanon .
Like us all , Ahmad Chalabi had faults .
It was often said he could n’t suffer fools - among which history may well include Paul Bremer , the hapless US viceroy who headed the occupation ’s Coalition Provisional Authority .
The clearest fools , however , were those , including half the American media , who were apparently shocked to discover in 2004 that Chalabi had long held the ‘ secret’ aim of ‘ hoodwinking’ the US to remove Saddam , partly with claims over his ‘ weapons of mass destruction’ .
Chalabi could be impatient , but he was more often wise .
His track record was bringing people together .
The Iraqi National Congress was formed in 1992 as the only broadly representative opposition grouping encompassing Iraqi nationalists , the Kurds and the Tehran - based Shia groups including Dawaa and the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq .
Chalabi personally mediated during the civil war between Kurdish factions in 1995 - 6 , sometimes at personal risk .
Some INC officers paid with their lives when Saddam ’s forces rolled forward in 1996 to back the Kurdish Democratic Party in that struggle : Chalabi ’s security chief Arras Habib , narrowly escaped as Baathist security went door to door .
Amid Iraq ’s troubles after 2003 , Chalabi frequently interceded , including with the militant Shia cleric , Moqtada Sadr .
If he had never wavered in his belief that force had been needed to oust Saddam , Chalabi ’s natural preference was to resolve disagreements through dialogue and concession .
If he never became prime minister , it was still to his Baghdad home that many Iraqi ministers quietly made their way to seek advice on anything from familial links to oil and finance .
Chalabi ’s knowledge was encyclopaedic , his memory phenomenal .
After all , this was a man with a PhD in mathematics from Chicago University who had published papers on algebra .
It was an unusual preparation for the murky world of Arab politics , and his great banking venture with Jordan ’s Petra Bank , leading to its 1989 collapse and his sentencing by a military court to 22 years in prison , left an issue that remains unresolved , with Chalabi always protesting innocence and his many critics alleging fraud .
But it is gently ironic that his death comes as the US and Iran , despite their differences , have not only reached a nuclear agreement but are belatedly engaging over the devastating war in Syria .
Chalabi knew very well that Iraq , even before Syria , was a victim of the hostility between Washington and Tehran .
I remember Chalabi in Baghdad in June 2004 insisting to me with unusual force that he had always made clear to the US that his primary loyalty was to Iraq and not Washington .
The first example he cited was Iran .
While president George Bush had two years earlier declared Iran an ‘ axis of evil’ , Chalabi said , Iraq needed to achieve good relations with its neighbour , widen economic links and end an animosity going back to the Ottoman period .
Chalabi ’s sudden passing , from a heart attack , has provoked a strong sense of loss .
“
I feel as if a page of history has turned , ” Chibli Mallat told me .
Ahmad Chalabi will be buried in the family vault at Najaf .
May God have mercy on his soul .

This article was amended on 4 November 2015 .
An earlier version referred to SOAS as the School of African and Oriental Studies , rather than the School of Oriental and African Studies ."
2016-01-27,"As Iran prepares for elections on 26 February for parliament and the Assembly of Experts , the body that chooses Iran ’s supreme leader , the name of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani crops up frequently in media and political discussions .
Iran ’s former president , whose political presence faded during the presidencies of Mohammad Khatami and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , is once again on the rise .
At 81 , Rafsanjani is embroiled again in a new political battle .
Over the past few years he has gained popularity among ‘ moderates’ , a term that has become popular since Hassan Rouhani was elected president in 2013 and which includes some figures previously seen as reformists and others as ‘ principle - ists’ .
He is already one of the Assembly ’s 78 members .
This week he was cleared to run again .
Saeed Abutaleb , a former principle - ist parliamentary deputy , predicts Rafsanjani is going to have a big win in the Assembly of Experts .
“
I think not only that Rafsanjani and his allies will be successful in the election , but it ’s even possible that Rafsanjani becomes the chairman of the assembly , ” he told Tehran Bureau .
The next chairman will have a “ very significant ” role , said Abutaleb , given the assembly may in its next eight - year term choose a successor to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran ’s supreme leader , who is 76 and in 2014 underwent prostate surgery .
And things do not end there for Rafsanjani .
His supporters have also geared up for the parliamentary elections , for which significant numbers of moderates leaning toward Rafsanjani have stepped forward .
The Guardian Council , which vets candidates for elections , has failed to qualify most of these candidates .
But despite all the hurdles , the new ‘ moderate’ faction still has the upper hand in the parliamentary elections , said Sadegh Zibakalam , professor of political science at Tehran University , given they have enough candidates qualified to win more seats than the nearly 30 they hold out of 288 , which is about 10 % .
The Guardian Council is reviewing the mass disqualifications and may reverse itself in some cases .
“ Rafsanjani and the moderates benefitted a lot from all the developments since the establishment of the new government [ in 2013 ] , especially the nuclear deal and consequently the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , ” he told Tehran Bureau .
“
So their chances are quite high for the election .
”
Any successes would leave them well short of a majority , said Abutaleb : “ The next parliament is not going to be dominated by moderates and Rafsanjani ’s allies , but I believe their presence would be more significant than the current parliament .
”
These days Rafsanjani is far more popular with the public than during the presidencies of Khatami and Ahmadinejad , when he was under constant attack by the government .
The roots of this unpopularity lay in his time as president from 1989 to 1997 .
Prior to becoming president , Rafsanjani also played a key role in Khamenei ’s ascent to supreme leader .
In 1989 when Ayatollah Khomeini , the founder of the Islamic Republic and its leader , died without designating a replacement , Rafsanjani , then a powerful parliamentary speaker , argued that Khomeini had been in favor of Khamenei ’s candidacy .
Khamenei was elected as the new supreme leader by the Assembly of Experts in June 1989 and two months later , Rafsanjani took over as the next president .
Rafsanjani ’s focus was on reviving the country ’s war - torn economy through economic liberalisation .
Arguably , he was successful as average annual GDP growth was 5.3 % during his presidency , far higher than the 1.6 % average growth under his predecessor Ali Khamenei ( 1981 - 1989 ) .
But the Rafsanjani era brought little in the way of political reform or openness .
His presidency was a time when dissidents were assassinated in the so - called “ chain murders ” and when the universities were subjected to tight control .
As Rafsanjani ’s first term ended in 1993 , discontent with his performance , as well as a challenge from three other candidates , saw the 94 % of votes he gained in the 1989 election against just one challenger drop to 63 % .
During the mid-90s , as talk of reform and change emerged and gained momentum , Rafsanjani appeared cautious .
When Khatami swept to office in 1997 , the Rafsanjani presidency was seen by reformists as “ patriarchal ” and financially corrupt .
The exposure of the state ’s role in the “ chain murders ” by journalist Akbar Ganji further tainted Rafsanjani among reformists .
When he stood in Tehran in the 2000 parliamentary election , Rafsanjani barely made it and later resigned .
The reformists held a majority in the parliament , while Rafsanjani ’s party , Kargozaran , formed in 1996 largely on a platform of economic development , won around 40 seats .
When Rafsanjani ran in the 2005 presidential election , he lost a run - off ballot to the then mayor of Tehran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who attacked him , if not by name , as corrupt .
Charges of corruption against him and his family ranged from bribery to accumulating illicit wealth through the oil trade , and these continued when Ahmadinejad was president .
A leading figure since the 1979 Revolution , Rafsanjani went into political isolation .
But 2009 marked a turning point in Rafsanjani ’s long career .
As protests over the presidential election results erupted , Rafsanjani earned the protesters’ attention by criticising Ahmadinejad ’s government .
On 17 July , 2009 , during his Friday sermon in Tehran , Rafsanjani attacked the authorities for mishandling the protests and called for the release of jailed protesters .
That marked his last appearance as Friday prayer speaker , and attacks intensified against Rafsanjani and his family , including daughter Faezeh and son Mohsen .
Another son , Mehdi , was briefly detained in 2012 accused of financial crimes and inciting the 2009 post - election unrest , and is now serving ten years in prison .
Over the years following the 2009 unrest , Rafsanjani ’s political presence was less visible .
In March 2011 he stepped down as the chair of the Assembly of Experts .
In 2013 , he was disqualified from running in the presidential election ostensibly on grounds of age .
But since Rouhani took office in August 2013 , Rafsanjani has once again publicly engaged in politics while making clear he has revised many of his views .
“
Looking at Rafsanjani ’s political stands and comments over the past few years , we see that his opinions have changed and become more moderate , ” said Abutaleb .
“
Now he is supported not only by reformist intellectuals , but also some of the moderate principle - ists .
”
Where Rafsanjani once wanted dissident students expelled from universities , he now calls for more openness in academia .
While he once rejected talk of “ reconciliation with the USA ” , by 2012 he expressed support for negotiations with Washington over Iran ’s nuclear programme , and he now insists Iran can not remain isolated from the US and the rest of the world .
And while the morality police was widely set up during Rafsanjani ’s presidency , when he supported enforcing Islamic dress codes and dealing with what he called “ moral corruption ” , if needs be by using “ some violence ” , by
2000 Rafsanjani said the authorities should not interfere unduly in the way people dressed .
But Rafsanjani is not the only politician who has changed .
The reformists have too , said Zibakalam .
“
Many of his radical opponents among the reformists and traditional leftists have realised that their strategy of destroying Rafsanjani ’s reputation was a big mistake , ” he explained .
“
So since the Ahmadinejad era , the reformists have got closer to him .
Now an unwritten coalition has formed between the reformists and Rafsanjani .
And even a wide range of moderate reformists have accepted his leadership .

2016-04-29,"Donald Trump is viewed with much amusement in Iran – his rhetoric and inflammatory statements remind many of their former hardline president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Seda , a reformist weekly publication , recently published a special report examining “ the phenomenon of Trump and his similarities with Ahmadinejad ” .
Its front cover carried a film poster sketch that depicted the Republican frontrunner wielding a scimitar with the former Iranian premier in the background wearing a cowboy hat .
“ Populists united ?
” read the big headline .
The US presidential race is mostly seen in Iran through the prism of the landmark nuclear deal , struck between Tehran and the world ’s six major powers last summer in Vienna .
That accord came into force in January when sanctions against Iran were officially lifted as part of the implementation process .
The big question among Iranians is whether the next US president will continue signing waivers to Iran ’s nuclear - related sanctions .
A refusal to do so can put the accord in jeopardy .
The Iranian authorities have refrained from publicly endorsing any candidates in the race to the White House , but in private there are concerns about the consequences of the election ’s outcome on the nuclear agreement .
Even Hillary Clinton , the Democratic frontrunner , is believed to hold a more hardline stance on Iran than Barack Obama .
Mohammad Javad Zarif , the Iranian foreign minister and one of the architects of the atomic accord , has said Iran will not interfere in the internal affairs of the US .
“
We are only watching and observing the process from far to see who will become the next president , ” he was quoted as saying during a visit to Thailand .
“
Naturally it is up to the American people to decide .
”
Iran has not always been a passive observant –
many believe that Tehran , in the middle of the furore over the infamous hostage crisis more than 35 years ago , played a crucial role in the coming to power of Ronald Reagan in the 1980s .
Trump was not an entirely unfamiliar name in Iran before running for president .
At least five of his books have been translated into Farsi and people have read about his business dealings .
Iranian MP Avaz Heydarpour Shahrrezayi , who sits on the parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy , believes that a Trump win will not affect the nuclear deal as the US Congress , he said , is bound to respect international treaties .
“
Trump or anyone else winning would not be able to nullify the nuclear deal , ” he said , according to the Iranian news website Tabnak .
Nasser Hadian , a university professor , told the reformist Shargh daily this week that Iran would benefit more if the Republican frontrunner becomes president .
“
It would be easier for Iran to work with Trump , ” he said .
According to Hadian , Trump lacks credibility among the US ’s European allies and it would be much harder for him to unite them against Iran in the future , which makes it easier for Tehran to avoid a concerted western front .
“
The only thing he [ Trump ] can do is to start a war and we should be careful about that , ” he added ."
2016-09-28,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the Iranian hardliner who presided over a period of deepening and damaging sanctions , has been blocked from running for president in Iran ’s elections next year .
The former president ’s hopes were dashed after the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , indicated in public that he did not see the prospect of his candidacy as being in the interests of the country .
In a letter published on Tuesday , Ahmadinejad announced he would not be running , submitting to the wishes of the 77-year - old ayatollah .
It comes after months of speculation that Ahmadinejad had been building up a campaign to confront the current president , the moderate cleric Hassan Rouhani , in next year ’s vote .
Rouhani has to seek re - election if he wants to remain in power for another four years .
Under Iranian law , presidents are only allowed two consecutive terms .
Earlier this month , the semi - official Fars news agency reported that the supreme leader had explicitly told Ahmadinejad he should not run .
Later , two conservative politicians confirmed those reports .
On Monday , Khamenei ’s official website , in an apparent move to put his opinion on the record , published the transcription of his speech during a meeting with a group of his followers .
“
Someone came to see me and considering his own interests and the interests of the country , I told him he should not participate in that matter [ elections ] , ” Khamenei is quoted as saying .
“
I did n’t tell him not to participate , I told him I wo n’t recommend him participating .
”
In his letter on Tuesday , which was addressed to Khamenei , Ahmadinejad revealed he had a meeting with the leader at the end of last month , during which he was told not to run .
“
You recommended that it was not in [ my ] interests to run in the elections
and I stated my obedience , ” he wrote .
In theory , Ahmadinejad can still put his name on the list as a nominee and the supreme leader does not have the automatic power to block him .
In practice , however , the ayatollah has the ultimate power in all state matters .
The Guardian Council , a body of jurists and clerics who are close to Khamenei , vets all candidates before any elections in Iran , in a process that has been the subject of much controversy .
There has been a heated debate over whether the Guardian Council has the constitutional footing to block candidates but in recent years , it has blocked many reformists and independents , as well as conservatives , from running in parliamentary and presidential elections .
Despite the vetting process , which has raised questions about the fairness of Iranian elections , turnouts are usually high in presidential elections .
Iranian leaders say the level of participation means the elections are legitimate .
The 2013 vote that put Rouhani in power was a contest between six candidates , all of whom were approved by the Guardian Council .
In the months leading up to this week ’s news , Ahmadinejad had indicated that he wanted to run , including by visiting provinces , becoming more active online and speaking at more occasions .
It is not clear why Khamenei decided to make the issue public , but Ahmadinejad seemed to have continued his activities despite their meeting .
The relationship between the two was fraught in the final years of Ahmadinejad ’s presidency because of a power struggle at the height of the Islamic Republic .
Ahmadinejad took extraordinary measures to confront Khamenei , including threatening to resign .
He was sidelined as Rouhani took office in 2013 but has become active .
Iranian elections have been full of surprises in recent years and it is not clear if Rouhani would face similar difficulties if he seeks re - election .
Khamenei has his own differences with Rouhani – he appears concerned about Rouhani ’s associates , particularly his brother , Hossein Fereydoun .
The ayatollah has made several controversial interventions , most notably in 2009 when he sided with Ahmadinejad against allegations of fraud , which led to a turbulent time in Iran .
The reverberations of that event are felt even today , with two of the four presidential candidates in the 2009 vote , who alleged the elections were stolen , still placed under arrest at the wishes of the leader .
Ahmadinejad and Rouhani are at odds over multiple domestic and foreign policies , particularly over last year ’s landmark nuclear deal , which the latter agreed to .
Some believe that as a relatively young politician in Iran , Ahmadinejad and his inner circle may have their eyes on the period after Khamenei , who underwent prostate surgery in 2014 ."
2016-11-02,"A former prosecutor general of Tehran described by activists as a serial human rights abuser has been sentenced to 135 lashes for financial corruption .
Saeed Mortazavi , 49 , was found guilty of “ seizing and wasting public funds ” while he ran Iran ’s social welfare organisation under the then president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , his close ally .
On Wednesday , the state - run news website Irib quoted a lawyer as saying Mortazavi had been given 70 lashes for seizing public funds and another 65 lashes for showing negligence in his job and wasting public money .
The sentencing has not yet been confirmed by judicial authorities .
Human rights groups said flogging was barbaric and inhuman , but called for him to face justice over his links to the deaths of several prisoners while he was a judiciary official .
Speaking to state - run news agency
Irna , the lawyer Mostafa Turk Hamedani said : “ We expected a heavier sentence given the accusations he was facing , but although I respect the opinion and the decision of the judge , I am going to file a complaint with the judiciary .
”
He said Mortazavi had been cleared of embezzlement .
Mortazavi , who was prosecutor general of Tehran from 2003 to 2009 , fell from grace because of his links to the deaths in custody of at least three protesters after the disputed 2009 presidential election that gave Ahmadinejad a second term as president .
While in office , Mortazavi tightened controls on the press , closing down 18 newspapers within two days , and handing down lengthy jail sentences to protesters and activists .
He was linked to the case of Zahra Kazemi , an Iranian - Canadian photographer who died in Evin prison in 2003 .
Tara Sepehri Far of Human Rights Watch said Mortazavi was linked with “ the most flagrant human rights abuses committed in recent years ” , including “ credible allegations of torture and deaths of protesters detained in the crackdown following the 2009 presidential election ” .
“
While this verdict shows that figures such as Mortazavi are not immune from prosecution for ever , justice should first and foremost prioritise addressing his role in Iran ’s darkest recent history , ” she said .
“
Yet , he also should be treated humanely , something that was denied to Iranians during his time as a prosecutor , and not be subjected to corporal punishment or other inhuman treatment .
”
The Iranian writer Akbar Ganji , a victim of Mortazavi ’s targeting of journalists , told the Guardian the sentencing was a “ whitewash ” .
“
It means that he is not being punished .
It is not surprising – one could not expect anything else from the Iranian judiciary .
Mortazavi is protected by the most powerful people in Iran .
He acted on their orders , ” Ganji said .
Mortazavi came under scrutiny from the Iranian parliament and judiciary soon after allegations surfaced about his role in the deaths of protesters imprisoned at the Kahrizak detention centre .
Mortazavi has since been acquitted of charges relating to this .
Hadi Ghaemi , of the New York - based International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran , said : “ This sentence is yet another example of rampant impunity in Iran .
No justice is being delivered here , given the extent of graft and corruption committed by Mortazavi , and his involvement in the torture and deaths of protesters in custody in 2009 .
Also , sentencing him to flogging , if meant to demonstrate a serious punishment , is just physical barbarity that does nothing to hold him accountable in any meaningful way .
”
Ahmadinejad went to great lengths to protect Mortazavi after the Kahrizak scandal , appointing him head of Iran ’s social security organisation , which provides insurance to many government and private employees .
In 2013 , Mortazavi ’s name was mentioned in the Iranian parliament in a hugely embarrassing public row between Ahmadinejad and the parliamentary speaker , Ali Larijani .
Ahmadinejad played a secretly filmed tape showing that Larijani ’s brother was allegedly trading on his sibling ’s influence for personal financial gain in a conversation with Mortazavi .
Mortazavi was briefly detained after the incident .
Amnesty International ’s Iran researcher , Raha Bahreini , said : “ Flogging and other forms of corporal judicial punishment violate international law and can not be justified in any circumstances .
“
Instead of meting out brutal punishments , the Iranian authorities should be abolishing all forms of corporal punishment and conducting an independent , impartial and thorough investigation into Saeed Mortazavi ’s alleged involvement in human rights violations , including the deaths , torture and arbitrary detention of dozens of protesters following the disputed presidential election in 2009 .

2016-11-30,"A cartoon in the Iranian satirical magazine Khat - khati depicts former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as a student at the lectern of his teacher , Donald Trump .
“
Excuse me
, ” the hardliner says , “ do you have a course handout ?
”
Iranians often make jokes to digest political upheaval , and Trump ’s rise to power has drawn comparisons with that of a leader closer to home – one whose eight years in office marked a deterioration in Iran - US relations .
Trump ’s transition so far has not been encouraging to Tehran : Michael Flynn , named as his national security adviser , and Mike Pompeo , his choice for the head of the CIA , have been vociferous in their opposition to Iran .
The CIA ’s outgoing director , John Brennan , has warned the US president - elect of “ disastrous ” consequences if he goes ahead with his campaign pledge to tear up a landmark deal with Iran over nuclear weapons .
However , politicians in Iran appear less anxious .
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran ’s supreme leader , went as far as praising Trump before the election , saying that “ because that man spoke more candidly and more openly , the people of America paid more attention to him ” .
Ali Motahari , an influential MP , said after Trump ’s win that his presidency was to Iran ’s advantage because Democrats “ would chop your head with cotton ” , a Persian idiom which means killing someone with kindness , and reflecting a view that the Islamic Republic has historically coped better with the Republicans .
“
Some in Iran were actually eager for a Trump presidency , ” said Tehran University professor Naser Hadian .
“
They think that Trump lacks international credibility and that there is a great deal of unpredictability involved , so that may be a positive thing .
And given his views about Putin and Syria , a narrative has been created in Iran that Trump may not actually be bad for Iran .
“
Trump is a pragmatist .
You never know whether he would do any deals with Iran behind the scenes .
” Iran ’s own pragmatists , notably the current president , Hassan Rouhani , however , do n’t share that view , said Hadian .
The fate of the nuclear accord is of great significance .
While Hadian believes Trump is unlikely to tear it up , there are fears that he would instead stifle Tehran ’s reconnection to the global economy by tightening non - nuclear sanctions relating to human rights or terrorism .
Khamenei , who said “ we neither mourn nor celebrate
”
Trump ’s win , has threatened to retaliate if the US approved extending sanctions for another 10 years , which he said would “ surely be against ” the agreement .
The deal , agreed in July 2015 between Iran , the five permanent UN security council members , Germany and the EU , sought to put controls on Iran ’s nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions and return of frozen assets .
Sadeq Zibakalam , a rare critical voice of the establishment inside the country , said Europeans had largely been supportive of the deal and that he did not foresee any big changes in the short term .
“
Trump can only act for America .
Europeans do n’t want the deal to be revoked , ” he told the Guardian .
“ Total [ the oil and gas company ] recently came to Iran for investment a couple of weeks ago , and even BP was here last week .
It shows that the UK and France and even Germans are serious about business with Iran , ” he said .
All the signals from the EU suggest it wants to keep the deal .
The EU foreign policy chief , Federica Mogherini , has made clear that the Iran nuclear agreement “ is not a bilateral agreement between the US and Iran ” , reminding the president - elect that he can not unilaterally tear up an agreement endorsed by the UN .
The British foreign secretary , Boris Johnson , is understood to be keen to visit Tehran early next year .
A spokeswoman for the UK Foreign Office said the deal “ marked a major step forward in preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapons capability and in normalising Iran ’s relations with the international community ” and that “ Britain will carry on working closely with international partners on the deal ’s continued implementation and success
” .
An Iranian government official told the Guardian that Tehran was not expecting the deal to be ditched under Trump , and reality will hit when he enters the White House .
“ America , however , is like a huge ship steaming in a tiny river , ” the official added .
“
It can create tsunamis which can destroy the little ships .
”
Hossein Rassam , former Iran adviser to the FCO , said Trump could play into the hands of hardliners who wish to limit change in Iran .
“
It would help hardliners prove to Rouhani and those who support the idea of engagement with the outside world in general and with the US in particular that there could be no friendship between the two , ” he said .
“
They want to immunise the Islamic Republic against intrusion [ known locally as nofooz ] .
When someone like Trump is in power , the chances of that happening would substantially decrease .
”
The thawing of diplomatic ice between Tehran and Washington , referred by some as a honeymoon , however , is over .
It was a “ fake honeymoon ” to begin with , Rassam said .
“ Parties to this marriage were in it only partially because each side had a lot of issues back home , and knowing that when this is over they would have to go back home and deal with some reality .
”
Internally , the stakes for Rouhani are high .
In May , he will have to face re - election for a second term .
“
Rouhani ’s chances of seeking re - election now face a challenge , ” Naser Imani , an analyst close to the conservative camp , told Tasnim news .
“
If Trump pursues serious actions on foreign policy and the nuclear deal , then Rouhani ’s chances of re - election can be affected .
”
For now , many in Tehran are keeping their fingers crossed , although realists , like parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani , have cautioned politicians against knee - jerk reactions .
Rassam said financial prospects for Iran were not great but many in Tehran hoped that they could capitalise on the estrangement between the US and Europe like when former reformist president Mohammad Khatami was in power .
“
From their point of view , there is some threat , but there is also the chance of that period of Iran - EU relationship happening again . ”"
2017-02-03,"Distorting realities , ignoring nuances and hijacking people ’s fears : that ’s the recipe for a demagogue who lives not on his own wits but others’ miseries .
It is particularly bad when the person or the country being targeted by that demagogue does little to straighten things out , which is exactly what is happening right now with Iran and Donald Trump .
Iranians know too well from their own experience with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , their hardline former president , how dangerous it is to have a politician telling you passionately half of the truth without caring that the other half is often a lie or a distortion of facts .
Trump ’s increasingly bellicose approach towards Iran , first by imposing a blanket travel ban , then putting Tehran “ on notice ” after a ballistic missile test , as well as by reported plans of new sanctions , carries two subtle messages .
The first message is that Iranophobia is going to be his adopted weapon to distract attentions at home , appeal strongly to the US ’s wealthy Arab allies who are already welcoming him as a moderate president , and please Benjamin Netanyahu .
Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif , reacting on Twitter to the missile test , is right to point out that Iran only spends a fraction on defence compared to the US ’s Arab allies in the region , which are big recipients of US , UK and French arms .
Trump ’s second message , albeit one barely admitted by his officials , is that his administration ’s problem is not just with the Iranian state , but with its people too .
His executive order suspending all entries to the US from seven predominantly Muslim countries affects Iranians to a greater extent than it does nationals from the other six states .
There are more Iranians in the US , and far more Iranian students are likely to be affected by the new measures than those from Iraq , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria and Yemen put together .
Last year , there were 12,269 Iranian students studying in the US , according to data by the Institute of International Education , compared to 5,085 from the six other countries .
Iranians are struggling to understand why they are being targeted in this way .
The most high - profile Iranian affected by the recent travel ban so far has not been an Iranian revolutionary guard , but Asghar Farhadi , the award - winning Iranian director whose new film The Salesman has earned him a nomination for a second Oscar .
Images that came out of airports were heartbreaking but inadvertently showed how successful Iranians are in the US .
There were Harvard - bound Iranian sisters detained , scientists stranded , artists in limbo .
Iranians expatriates in the US have indeed been immensely successful .
In fact , Iran ’s brain drain problem is due to the many talented students who emigrate to the US .
Omid Kordestani , the executive chairman of Twitter , the very platform Trump uses to broadcast his views on a daily basis , is Iranian .
The founder of eBay , Pierre Omidyar , is Iranian .
Maryam Mirzakhani , who won the Fields Medal , the highest accolade in mathematics , in 2014 , is another example .
No American national has been killed by an Iranian on US soil since 1975 and the US has produced more Islamic State fighters than Iran has .
Yet for over a decade , the US has viewed Iran and its nuclear activities as its biggest threat .
Now Iran has shut down most of that programme and agreed to a high level of inspection currently not applied to any other country .
But the US is still worried .
What is increasingly clear is that the US will remain worried so long as the Islamic Republic is in power .
This is not to say that Iran is not involved in any fishy business .
At home , the country ’s human rights record remains dismal .
A number of political prisoners are languishing in jail , with some on hunger strike .
Religious minorities are discriminated against and the country has a high rate of executions .
The biggest current problem is Iran ’s involvement in Syria , where it is staunchly supporting the brutal Bashar al - Assad , although large segments of Iranian society are critical about it , as seen in a funeral that turned into a rare display of dissent earlier this month .
But Trump ’s focus on Iran has been disproportionate , politically biased and overblown .
The threat to Iran is not just from Trump but rather the combination of a reckless , ignorant leader , surrounded by hawks blind to nuances on the ground and bent on regime change .
Some of his senior appointees have backed MEK , a fringe Iranian opposition group extremely unpopular in Iran .
They fought alongside Saddam Hussain against Iran in the eight - year war in the 1980s .
Breitbart , the American news website closely linked to the Trump administration , recently pushed the claims of the former Shah ’s son , Reza Pahlavi , introducing him as the alternative to Iran ’s problem .
Pahlavi does not have a strong base in Iran and the monarchy , despite occasional nostalgia for its glories , remains unpopular .
Iran , too , has to do more .
It should learn how demonising another country can backfire and should do all it can to keep Europe on its side .
This is why if Iran wants to win support at this critical moment , the continuing detention of British - Iranian mother Nazanin Zaghari - Ratcliffe does exactly the opposite .
Iran should realise how such poor treatment of innocent people affects minds in the west .
For its own sake , as well as hers , it should release her .
Iranians have paid a high price for the inflammatory statements of their statesmen , but they have paid a bigger price for the ignorance of the opposite side to domestic politics in Iran , its lack of knowledge about the country ’s history .
Trump ’s behaviour only plays into the hands of hardliners in Iran , particularly those who want to show the president , Hassan Rouhani , was wrong to find peace with the west .
For nearly 38 years , Iranian leaders have failed to convince their people that the US , which they call “ the Great Satan ” , was their “ enemy ” too .
Trump ’s first fortnight in office suggests that he may do that job for them ."
2017-02-17,"Human rights campaigners have accused Iran of silencing the mother of a protester who was killed in post - election unrest in 2009 .
Shahnaz Akmali ’s son , Moustafa Karimbeigi , was shot dead in December 2009 during protests after Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won a second term in office .
Akmali was arrested last month after intelligence officials raided her workplace and her house in Tehran .
Officials have not explained the reasons for her arrest .
Akmali became politically active after her son ’s killing , visiting families of other victims to show her solidarity .
Recently she had campaigned for the release of Arash Sadeghi , a student activist serving a 19-year jail sentence , who was on hunger strike for several months until January .
Before her arrest , Akmali had complained about pressure on her and her family , particularly her daughter .
“
Kill me too , kill my daughter , but I will not keep quiet and will follow my son ’s path
, ” she said in a video aired on Voice of America ’s Persian service shortly after her arrest .
Discussing a visit to victims’ graves alongside other families , she said : “ We were just visiting the graves of our children , why would you arrest us ?
Why would you interrogate us at gunpoint ?
”
She was released then but detained again on 25 January .
Akmali said in the video that the authorities had threatened to kill her daughter if she did not stop advocating for the plight of other families : “
They called me again and said we will kill your daughter the same way we ’ve killed your son , so shut up .
Stay home and just recite Qur’an for your son , we will kill you and your daughter if you leave home .
”
Amnesty International ’s
Iran researcher Raha Bahreini said Akmali had been detained solely on account of “ her courageous human rights work ” , and urged Tehran to release her immediately and unconditionally .
“
The continued detention of Shahnaz Akmali is another example of the repressive tactics Iranian authorities regularly resort to in a bid to deter human rights defenders from speaking out and supporting victims of violations , ” she said .
“
Instead of criminalising and jailing human rights defenders still working in the country , the Iranian authorities must investigate and hold accountable perpetrators of human rights violations , including those responsible for the torture and killing of her son Moustafa Karimbeigi during the 2009 post - presidential election protests .
”
Bahreini added : “ For years Iranian intelligence officials have been harassing and threatening families of detainees in order to scare them into silence .
The threats made against Shahnaz Akmali ’s family to stay quiet about her detention is a very worrying escalation of that and should stop .
”
Human Rights Watch
’s
Sarah Leah Whitson said : “ Arbitrarily detaining a woman who has repeatedly asked for justice for her son is simply shameful .
The judiciary should focus on finding out who killed Shahnaz [ Akmali ] ’s son , instead of prosecuting her for peaceful activism .
”"
2017-03-09,"Less than two months into his presidency , Donald Trump has already outperformed his Iranian rival in demagoguery , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , making him look like a novice .
No wonder the two - term president thinks he has some catching - up to do .
He published an 11-second - long video on Twitter on Sunday , urging people to follow his newly opened account , and leaving no doubt that the “ husband , dad , grandfather , university professor , president , mayor ,
proud Iranian ” behind @Ahmadinejad1956 is authentic .
Had he not offered proof , it would have been almost impossible to tell it from the many parody accounts under his name .
His use of English in that video , albeit quite basic and disjointed , suggests that this will be a platform to project his views to the outside world .
Surely it ’s only a matter of days before we see him mention @realDonaldTrump , potentially sparking a clash of two of the world
’s most famous rabble rousers .
But perhaps they will get on .
There are , after all , many similarities between the two men .
They were both anti - establishment candidates .
When Ahmadinejad ran for his first term , in 2005 , he was seen as “ a man of the people ” and someone not corrupted , like the elite .
Both men rely heavily on an inner circle of trusted advisers .
While Trump has Steve Bannon , Ahmadinejad had Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , his closest aide and a hugely controversial figure .
Both seem invincible in interviews and have an extraordinary ability to lure the media .
Ahmadinejad has , in fact , already reached out to the US president .
A week before joining Twitter , the very platform that he banned while in office , he resorted to his old habit of letter - writing to offer the new US president advice on governance and even women ’s rights .
“
Hello there , ” he says , greeting the US president with 3,400-plus words in a gesture that is not meant to be political , he says , but from “ a human to another human ” .
The best bit is his advice on women .
“
Women depict God ’s beauty and are God ’s most beautiful and valuable gift .
Respecting women and dignifying them is a sign of magnanimity , ” he writes , before signing the letter “ Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , in the service of the Iranian people ” .
Could this be a mischievous reference to the intended recipient ’s notorious “ Grab them by the pussy ” comments ?
The letter remains unanswered , which probably explains why Ahmadinejad is belatedly trying his luck with Twitter .
His first days on the social network offer us some clues as to his positioning : he is following no one , not even the supreme leader , Ayatollah Khamenei , whose office tweets @khamenei_ir .
Khamenei ’s account follows six others ; five of which are his other accounts in different languages , plus an account associated with the late founder of the 1979 Iranian revolution Ruhollah Khomeini , presumably run by Khamenei ’s office as well .
Other Iranian politicians on Twitter , including President Hassan Rouhani and the foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif ( who is the most Twitter - savvy Iranian official ) all dutifully follow their leader .
Iranian officialdom appears to be coming to the conclusion that the existing ban on Twitter is one that ultimately disadvantages them , both internally and externally .
Regional rivals such as Saudi Arabia have exploited the ban to outmanoeuvre Iran in the court of public opinion .
The banner picture at the top of Ahmadinejad ’s
Twitter page is of Mount Damavand , the country ’s highest peak .
Having been sidelined since he left office in 2013 , it looks like he ’s trying to reinvent himself by focusing on Iranian nationalism .
Recent pictures of him posted on Instagram also show him next to the tomb of Cyrus the Great and Persepolis , relics of Iran ’s pre - Islamic history .
If Trump won by stoking fear about immigrants and refugees , it is becoming clear that Ahmadinejad would focus on patriotic populism if he ever gets another chance to run as president .
In fact , Iran ’s next presidential election is looming , scheduled for May.
But Ahmadinejad has already been told by the supreme leader that it would be better for him not to run .
In effect , this blocks his candidacy .
You would n’t know it –
he has been acting as if he is running .
Ultimately , it ’s hard , however , to see him defying Khamenei ’s decision .
Ahmadinejad ’s
Twitter handle also includes his birth year .
That reminds us that Ahmadinejad is relatively young and may have his eyes on the post - Khamenei era .
Ahmadinejad ’s public confrontation with Khamenei in the final years of his presidency has for now put his chances of another presidential run in doubt , so long as the ayatollah is alive .
But Ahmadinejad is clever and sees the benefit in Khamenei ’s blocking of him .
He knows well enough that those marginalised by Khamenei , in several cases , have seen their credibility in the eyes of the public only increase .
In the years following Ahmadinejad ’s first election victory in 2005 , large numbers of Iranians came to regret their choice .
Iranians’ experiences with Ahmadinejad offer some useful lessons for Americans .
It takes time for a demagogue such as Trump to show his real face , but the legacy they leave behind can be devastating .
The moderate Rouhani spent four years just getting the country back to square one .
Given Trump ’s support in Congress , for America , it could be a lot longer ."
2017-04-12,"Former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has registered to run in the presidential race next month , defying an edict from the country ’s supreme leader not to do so .
Reporters with the Associated Press news agency described watching as stunned election officials processed the hardliner ’s paperwork on Wednesday .
The surprise decision will likely upend an election many believed would be won by the incumbent , Hassan Rouhani , a moderate who negotiated the nuclear deal with world powers .
It also makes Ahmadinejad the most high - profile Iranian politician to defy the wishes of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has the final say in all state matters .
Last year , Khamenei took the unusual decision to reveal he had told Ahmadinejad he did not recommend he enter the contest .
“
Someone came to see me and considering his own interests and the interests of the country , I told him he should not participate in that matter [ elections ] , ” Khamenei was quoted by his official website last year , referring to Ahmadinejad .
“
I did n’t tell him not to participate , I told him I wo n’t recommend him participating .
”
But in a news conference shortly after submitting his registration , Ahmadinejad described the comments by the supreme leader as “ just advice ” .
There was no immediate reaction from Khamenei ’s office .
Ahmadinejad had initially said in a press conference in Tehran last week that he was formally backing a former deputy , Hamid Baghaei , and that he did not plan to run himself .
He previously served two four - year terms from 2005 to 2013 .
Under Iranian law , he became eligible to run again after four years out of office , but he remains a polarising figure , even among fellow hardliners .
Iran ’s economy suffered under heavy international sanctions during his administration because of western suspicions that Tehran was secretly pursuing nuclear weapons .
Iran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes .
His registration as a candidate is the second surprising announcement in Iran ’s presidential race .
On Sunday , Ebrahim Raisi , a conservative cleric close to Khamenei , announced he would put his name on the list .
Over the past year , Raisi has been touted as a frontrunner to become Khamenei ’s successor , a higher position than that of the president .
His run for the presidency has puzzled Iranian political commentators who are asking what his candidacy might mean for Rouhani , who is expected to seek re - election .
Raisi ’s decision comes amid concerns about the possible disqualification of Rouhani in the vetting process .
The Guardian Council , a body of jurists and clerics who are close to Khamenei , vets all candidates before any elections in Iran , in a process that has been the subject of controversy .
There has been heated debate over whether the council has the constitutional footing to block candidates .
In recent years it has blocked many reformists and independents , as well as conservatives , from running in parliamentary and presidential elections .
Although Khamenei controversially sided with Ahmadinejad in a dispute over the 2009 presidential election , which prompted huge protests across the country , the relationship between the two was fraught in the final years of Ahmadinejad ’s presidency because of a power struggle at the height of the Islamic Republic .
Despite Khamenei ’s advice , Ahmadinejad had been building a campaign in the months leading to the official registration – visiting provinces , becoming more active online and speaking at more occasions .
He recently joined Twitter .
More than 120 prospective candidates , including six women and seven clerics , submitted their names on the first day of registration on Tuesday .
Registration remains open until Saturday .
The election on 19 May is being seen by many in Iran as a referendum on the 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers and its ability to improve the country ’s sanctions - hobbled economy .
Under that deal , Iran agreed to curb its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions .

2017-04-20,"Iran ’s former hardline president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has been disqualified from running in Iran ’s presidential elections next month , according to the final list of approved candidates announced on Thursday .
Iran ’s
interior ministry said that the guardian council – the group of influential jurists and clerics that vets all candidates – had approved six politicians to run , including the moderate incumbent , Hassan Rouhani .
Also on the list are Ebrahim Raisi , a close ally of the country ’s supreme leader ; the mayor of Tehran , Mohammad - Bagher Ghalibaf ;
Rouhani ’s first deputy , Eshaq Jahangiri ; and relatively low - profile politicians Mostafa Agha Mirsalim and Mostafa Hashemi - Taba .
But the list excluded more than 1,600 other nominees who had applied to run for president , including all 137 female candidates – and Ahmadinejad .
The council ’s decision marks a new nadir in the deteriorating relationship between the Iranian establishment and Ahmadinejad , whose controversial re - election in 2009 plunged the country into crisis .
Ahmadinejad ’s exclusion means the presidential race will probably be a tight three - man race between Rouhani , Raisi and Ghalibaf .
Jahangiri has already announced that his candidacy is tactical and that he intends to eventually drop out in favour of Rouhani .
He is believed to have entered the race to help Rouhani to defend his legacy by buying more airtime in presidential debates and media opportunities .
Raisi ’s surprise entry in the race earlier this month has threatened what many had expected would be a relatively straightforward bid by Rouhani for a second term .
After rapidly rising in prominence over the past year , he is being touted as a possible successor to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Raisi and Ghalibaf originally belonged to a coalition of conservatives known as the Popular Front of Islamic Revolution Forces , or Jamna , which said only one candidate would ultimately run .
But both men have distanced themselves from the coalition and it is still not clear if either will pull out in favour of the other .
Some analysts say a defeat would scupper Raisi ’s chances of succeeding Khamenei and that he is therefore likely to drop out at the last minute .
Last week , Ahmadinejad surprised observers by registering to run in defiance of Khamenei who had told him to stay out of the race .
He had kept the decision secret and had said that he was only accompanying his former deputy , Hamid Baghaei , to the registration office for the latter to put his name forward .
While Baghaei was registering , Ahmadinejad stunned registration officials when he took his national ID out of his pocket and asked to apply .
Khamenei took Ahmadinejad ’s side in the unrest in the aftermath of his re - election in 2009 , but the relationship between the two grew fraught in the final years of Ahmadinejad ’s presidency .
He served two consecutive terms and oversaw a period of huge uncertainty amid international sanctions over Iran ’s nuclear programme .
He still enjoys a considerable fanbase in Iran , mainly among conservatives , which means his disqualification could cost the establishment dearly .
Commentators say Ahmadinejad and his inner circle , who had been sidelined under Rouhani , may have their eyes on the period after Khamenei , who underwent prostate surgery in 2014 .
His disqualification could help him regain some of his credibility among a large constituency critical of the Iranian establishment .
Ahmadinejad joins an expanding list of former Iranian presidents who have fallen foul of the establishment following their departure from office .
The reformist former president , Mohammad Khatami , whose backing of Rouhani in 2013 was crucial in the current president ’s election , also faces restrictions .
Media is banned from using his name or images , although the restrictions appear to have been relaxed as the 19 May elections approach .
Former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , who died earlier this year , was blocked from running in the 2013 presidential elections , and Abolhassan Banisadr , Iran ’s first post - revolutionary president , currently lives in exile .
There were some angry social media reactions after Ahmadinejad ’s exclusion .
“
Disqualifying candidates is illegal .
If Ahmadinejad has committed a crime , why has n’t been put on trial all these years ? ,
” tweeted Iranian user @sahartwitt .
“
We are opposed to the disqualifications of the Guardian Council , it ’s not right for the council to decide what the people are meant to decide .
”
Iranian poet Fatemeh Shams wrote on her Facebook page : “
[ Ahmadinejad ’s ] eight years of presidency came at the cost of so much blood , imprisonment , house arrest and exile .
It took the [ supreme ] leader a long time to come to the very same conclusion as that of the Green movement supporters in 2009 .
And the leaders of the Green movement [ Mir - Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi ] are still under house arrest after 6 years .
What a dirty show .
”"
2017-08-17,"An ailing 79-year - old Iranian opposition leader who has been under house arrest since February 2011 has embarked on a hunger strike , demanding authorities try him in public .
Mehdi Karroubi , a former presidential candidate , fell foul of the establishment following the disputed re - election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009 , which led to months of unrest .
A leader of the Green movement , he was put under round - the - clock surveillance by guards living in his home six years ago , without being put on trial or publicly charged .
He has been taken to hospital twice in the last three weeks and has undergone heart surgery .
Saham News , a website close to Karroubi , quoted his wife as saying that he started the dry hunger strike soon after performing his morning prayers on Wednesday , and that he will refuse to eat or drink until his demands are met .
“
He wants the security guards to leave the premises of his house , ” she said .
“
Never before – pre - Islamic revolution nor after it – we have seen such presence of guards , living inside the house alongside those under house arrest , keeping all aspects of his life under watch , through bugs and cameras .
“
If the house arrest is to continue , he wants to be put on trial in public , after six and a half years under house arrest , he wants the authorities to announce when they will hold a trial in public .
”
Two other opposition leaders , Mir Hossein Mousavi , also a former presidential candidate , and his wife , Zahra Rahnavard , were put under house arrest in Tehran in similar circumstances in 2011 .
Both Karroubi and Mousavi are suffering from medical complications partly as a result of their age .
Mousavi , 75 , has also been taken to hospital a number of times in recent years .
Some members of the three leaders’ immediate families are allowed to visit them in pre - arranged and approved meetings .
“
My father wants a trial that is held in public and in the presence of a jury as provisioned by article 168 of the constitution , ” Karroubi ’s son , Mohammad - Taghi Karroubi , said .
“
The establishment wants a quiet end to the house arrests , without paying a price .
My father has said that he will not challenge the verdict of a trial , he has n’t had a chance to defend himself and he wants to respond to the accusations made by the state .
”
He said he had spoken to his father by phone recently when he was discharged from hospital .
It was the first time in six months the two had been allowed to talk .
“
My father is on the verge of becoming 80 and a dry hunger strike , which given his health complications raises serious concerns .
”
The continued restrictions on opposition leaders is a major challenge for the moderate president , Hassan Rouhani , and popular demand for an end to the house arrests is high .
Almost every rally Rouhani held during the campaign that led to his re - election in May featured chants by supporters in support of Karroubi , Mousavi and Rahnavard .
Karroubi ’s recent medical problems have prompted renewed pleas for his release .
A number of activists and supporters tried to visit him in hospital , but were prevented from doing so .
Pictures surfaced online of activists expressing sympathy with his wife outside the hospital .
One image showed Karroubi in his hospital bed with his wife at his side , and with flowers sent on behalf of Mousavi and Rahnavard .
Karroubi , who was imprisoned before the Islamic revolution in 1979 , told the Guardian in a rare 2010 interview that despite widespread corruption , the shah treated his opponents less harshly than the regime at the time .
Amnesty International also expressed concern on Wednesday about the health of an incarcerated Iranian human rights defender , Arash Sadeghi , who it said was critically ill .
Sadeghi , 30 , suffers from deteriorating digestive and respiratory problems .
“
The denial of access to medical care in these circumstances amounts to torture , ” it said ."
