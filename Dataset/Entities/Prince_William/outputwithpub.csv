2003-06-21,"You can only feel for the boy .
The other day Peter Archer , court correspondent of the Press Association , interviewed Prince William on all our behalves .
The interview is running in many other newspapers today , but the style was stereotypical .
William was n't awkward , spotty , smelly or gauche .
Instead he was "" self - confident , relaxed , impressive ... ""
He did n't stammer or sweat , his conversation was n't banal or stilted .
He was perfect .
The impressed Archer noted the prince 's "" firm handshake , welcoming smile and boyish charm "" .
I liked this combination , so I loaded them into my search engine .
And found them only in two other places .
The first was a client 's review of a male escort in Seattle ; and the other was in a romantic story that continued : "" ' Emma , ' he groaned as his mouth travelled down her throat .
He nipped gently at the sensitive skin just below her ear , then ... "" I draw a veil over where he went next , save to say that there was n't much boyish about it .
As if this gush was n't bad enough William ( had he been watching BBC1 on Wednesday night ) would have had to endure a programme in which former royal correspondent Jenni Bond did her Wendy Darling equivalent of "" Phwoar , if I were only 20 years younger , I 'd give ' i m one ! ""
And what has he got to look forward to ?
Being filmed making small talk with his father after the polo match - for the next 30 years .
A half century of being analysed by Penny Junor , as she gradually decomposes in her royal pundit 's armchair .
A lifetime ( and more ) of being the subject of countless books by cynical hacks , all claiming to know his heart better than he does .
And above all , as one press man put it on the BBC programme , being perpetually the "" red meat "" wanted by the sharks .
Caring For the moment he is loved by the toothy denizens of the ocean , and the real bores must be the protocol , and the hand - shaking .
For now he is "" amusing and always sincere "" , not naïve and badly advised .
He knows that this decade 's word is "" caring "" , which is what he seeks to be , what his mother was , what Harry is , what his father has been .
One day it will be a word that he does n't know .
Right now he can be innocent , if he likes .
About his 21st birthday party tonight he told Archer : "" My father very kindly suggested having a party , though he 's probably regretting it now .
But he very kindly offered and my grandmother and my father basically helped to organise it all "" .
This is n't William Windsor so much as pure William Brown , trying hard to get something out of his perpetually disapproving pater .
But there were signs that William has understood his real role .
This is not constitutional ; William 's role - one that he never sought - is psychological .
His formal function may be ceremonial , opening things , launching things , going around caring etc .
But his actual function is sacrificial , and he probably knows it .
"" I have so many people around me , "" he told Archer .
"" I can get pulled in one direction or the other .
I could actually lose my identity .
Everybody wants you for some reason or another . ""
He is Truman in The Truman Show .
What is he for ?
He is for lunch .
In this country the royal family have become scapegoats , blamed by us for the lives that we want them to lead - and therefore blamed by us for ourselves .
When they slip up , or we get bored , we kill them .
We are , however , by no means the first to do this ; incidences of this kind of regicide recur in history and anthropology .
Sir James Frazer in The Golden Bough , refers to the customs in ancient Thessaly and Boetia , where the kings were occasionally sacrificed to the Laphystian Zeus , if the country thought harvests were n't good enough , or the measles was bad .
Incidentally , the king could always dodge this arrangement by nominating his oldest son to be offed in his stead .
Death was by stoning .
Or William might reflect on the people of the Shilluk of the White Nile .
There the king was put to death at the first sign of infirmity "" lest with his diminishing vigour the cattle should sicken and fail , the crops should rot in the field , "" and circulations or ratings fall .
The sign of his imminent demise was when someone put a white cloth over his face and knees "" as he lay slumbering under a tree in the sultry heat of the afternoon "" .
Then he 'd be taken to a special hut and strangled .
We do something slower these days .
But the most appropriate to the present situation would be the plight of the monarch of Quilacare in India .
He 'd exist for 12 years in the utmost luxury .
Palaces , concubines , Yamaha motorbikes , the lot .
At the end of which he mounts a scaffold and - according to Frazer - "" before all the people he takes some sharp knives and begins to cut off his nose , and then his ears and then all his members , and as much flesh off himself as he can "" , and when this all gets too much he cuts his own throat and expires in a pool of blood .
Or , as William said about his father : "" I just wish people would give him a break "" .
Which should be translated as meaning : "" One day they 'll cut me to pieces too , and I never even applied for the job . ""
Good luck to the boy .
Those who are pretending to be his greatest friends will soon become his most terrible enemies ."
2003-06-22,"A steady girlfriend is out of the question for Prince William , he revealed this weekend .
Unless he can find someone tough enough to cope with the relentless public attention , William , who celebrated his 21st birthday yesterday , will not consider a serious relationship . '
There 's a lot of speculation about every single girl I 'm with and it does quite irritate me , ' he confessed on the eve of his coming - of - age party at Windsor Castle . '
The more so because it 's a complete pain for the girls .
These poor girls , you know , who I 've either just met and get photographed with , or they 're friends of mine , suddenly get thrown into the limelight and their parents get rung up and so on .
It 's a little unfair on them really . '
The prince also bemoaned the fact that he is unable to protect his female friends from the kind of scrutiny he has become used to over the years . '
I 'm used to it because it happens quite a lot now .
But it 's very difficult for them , and I do n't like that at all , ' he said .
Among the young friends invited to the African - themed fancy dress party for 300 last night were Jecca Craig , his former companion in Kenya ; his St Andrews University flatmate , Kate Middleton ; the polo - playing Natalie Hicks - Lobbecke ; and party - girl Davina Duckworth - Chad , who joined William for a summer cruise .
The prince claimed he is happy to ask a woman out , but wary of causing them difficulties . '
Only the mad girls chase me , I think , ' he said , jokingly , adding : ' No , I 've never been aware of anyone chasing me , but if they were , could they please leave their telephone number ? '
Denying that he had ever been really shy , he said his trademark bowed head in early news pictures was a naive attempt to keep his face relatively anonymous . '
It was so that people would n't recognise me
and I could still go out with friends and things like that , ' he said . '
So they just saw the top of my head .
But usually I was photographed with my eyes looking up through a big blond fringe .
It was very silly . '
He did admit , however , that he is not a naturally extrovert personality . '
I would n't say I prefer to be unnoticed , because that 's never going to happen , but I 'm someone who does n't particularly like being the centre of attention . '
But when it comes to women , he is more confident . '
If I fancy a girl
and I really like her
and she fancies me back , which is rare
, I ask her out , ' he said . '
But at the same time I do n't want to put them in an awkward situation because a lot of people do n't quite understand what comes with knowing me , for one , and secondly , if they were my girlfriend there is the excitement it would probably cause . '
William appealed again to the media to allow him privacy at university . '
I do n't think either side wants to return to the free - for - all of the old days , ' he said . '
The media can be tricky at times , but so can most people .
It 's something that I want to handle with the most maturity I can .
So it is difficult , but it 's not impossible . '
While he was born His Royal Highness Prince William of Wales , the prince wants to be known as William . '
I am and always will be an HRH , but out of personal choice I like to be called William , because that is my name
and I want people to call me William - for now . '
He went on to confirm his commitment to the monarchy and to his future role as king . '
It 's not a question of wanting to be -
it 's something I was born into
and it 's my duty , ' he said . '
Wanting is not the right word , but those stories about me not wanting to be king are all wrong . '
William said it was an important role which he could never take lightly . '
It 's all about helping people , and dedication , and loyalty , which I hope I have -
I know I have .
Sometimes I do get anxious about it , but I do n't really worry a lot .
I want to get through university and then maybe start thinking seriously about that in the future .
I think about it a lot , but they are my own personal thoughts .
I 'll take each step as it comes and deal with it as best I can . '
William said he felt part of history , especially when he was with his father 's side of the family . '
The monarchy is something that needs to be there - I just feel it 's very , very important
- it 's a form of stability , and I hope to be able to continue that . '"
2003-06-23,"The home secretary , David Blunkett , yesterday demanded an urgent inquiry into how a man was able to gatecrash Prince William 's 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle .
The intruder was arrested by police at about 11.20pm on Saturday after reportedly interrupting the prince as he made a speech in front of more than 300 friends and relatives in the Great Hall .
The man is said to have stumbled on to the stage and grabbed the prince 's microphone before starting to shout .
He was seized by security staff and led away yelling : "" You can see me next Monday .
"" Police declined to confirm reports that he was a stand - up comedian , Aaron Barschak .
Fred Barschak , 72 , yesterday claimed to have recognised his son as the man was being led away by police after he incident , and stressed that he would not have intended to harm anyone and was probably trying to publicise his act .
The comedian , who goes under the name Comedy Terrorist , regularly dresses up as Osama bin Laden .
His previous targets have included Ken Livingstone , the mayor of London , and the comedians Terry Jones and Graham Norton . ""
He would not have been trying to harm anyone , not at all , "" Mr Barschak said outside his home in Kilburn , north London .
"" He is not at all anti - royal .
He is a professional stand - up comedian who is desperate to be a serious actor . ""
To penetrate so far into the castle would have required ingenuity and determination , even with so many guests and outside caterers and staff entering the building during the course of the afternoon and evening .
A Home Office spokeswoman confirmed that Mr Blunkett had ordered an immediate review of the incident , to be led by police and royal security advisers .
Mr Blunkett indicated that he may ask for a further inquiry , depending on the outcome of the initial review .
It is understood that many of the guests at the Out of Africa themed party initially believed that the man was part of the organised entertainment .
It was only when the shouting began that the gravity of the situation became clear .
Prince William was said to have attempted to lighten the mood by later reclaiming the microphone and joking : "" I did n't know my brother could do an accent like that . ""
Thames Valley police arrested the intruder on suspicion of burglary , which covers unauthorised entry to premises .
He was later transferred to Metropolitan police custody .
Scotland Yard said last night that a 36-year - old man from London had been bailed to return to a London police station next month , pending further inquiries .
A spokeswoman at St James 's Palace said : "" Security is a matter for the Metropolitan police and the ball is now in their court .
The members of the royal family do not comment on breaches or issues of security as a matter of course . ""
Security at royal residences and at external events has been improved over the years , but intruders have still been able to get surprisingly close to senior members of the royal family on occasions .
There have been abseilers and would - be gatecrashers at Buckingham Palace , an attempt in the 1970s to kidnap Princess Anne in the Mall and , most notorious of all , the appearance of Michael Fagan in the Queen 's bedroom one morning in 1982 .
On that occasion , Fagan , who had climbed over the wall of the palace and up a drainpipe , woke the Queen ; it took two alarm calls for her to summon assistance while she kept him talking .
The then home secretary , Willie Whitelaw , offered his resignation , but it was not accepted .
Security in and around Windsor Castle was visibly tighter yesterday , with uniformed members of Thames Valley police positioned around the castle .
Thames Valley police are responsible for policing the boundaries , while the Metropolitan police and special branch officers have jurisdiction within the grounds ."
2003-06-23,"The home secretary , David Blunkett , tonight said he was "" deeply concerned "" by the security breach at Prince William 's 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle .
He said he would be examining overnight a six - page police chronology of events leading up to Saturday 's embarrassing gate - crashing of the exclusive party , by a little - known comedian dressed as a female Osama bin Laden .
Mr Blunkett plans to make a full statement to the Commons tomorrow and is determined to see that "" lessons are learned "" from the incident .
Asked if heads would roll over the security breakdown , the home secretary said : "" The heads of the services are in no doubt about that . ""
But he added : "" I 'm not at the moment looking for scapegoats , I am looking for answers to very difficult questions . ""
The Scotland Yard commissioner , Sir John Stevens , today apologised to the royal family today for the "" appalling "" breach of security which allowed Aaron Barschak to gain access to the party at Windsor Castle .
Mr Barschak , 36 , got in by scaling an embankment , climbing a tree , jumping on to a wall and reaching a terrace .
The Metropolitan police assistant commissioner , David Veness , said : "" He was challenged by a contractor and escorted to a police point .
He gave what appeared to be a credible story and was allowed into the area of the castle where the party was taking place . ""
In a prepared statement , Mr Veness said : "" The events at Windsor Castle are wholly unacceptable and a matter of great regret . ""
The commissioner has tendered apologies to the royal family for the appalling breach of security at Windsor Castle on Saturday evening . ""
This seems to have been an operational failure , which should not have happened whatever the circumstances . ""
Scotland Yard has set up an independent inquiry led by Commander Frank Armstrong of the City of London police , an expert on protection .
Mr Barschak describes himself as a "" comedy terrorist "" and has gate - crashed several public events in the past in an apparent bid to raise his profile .
Just last month , the comedian barged onstage during the London Comedy Festival , and last year he interrupted a speech by London mayor Ken Livingstone .
He also rushed the stage during a filmed tribute to comedian Spike Milligan .
He is due to perform at the Edinburgh Fringe this summer , in a show entitled Osama Likes it Hot ."
2003-06-23,"The gatecrasher at Prince William 's birthday party was just the latest in a line of royal security scares .
Below are some of the more serious : 1995 : Student John Gillard , 21 , drove 200 miles from his Wakefield home to ram the gates of Buckingham Palace with his car .
One of the two - and - a - half tonne gates was ripped off its hinges by the 50 mph impact , but the royal family was not at home and no - one was hurt .
Gillard was detained under the Mental Health Act .

THE ROYAL GATECRASHER :
THE PAPERS WADE IN
As if Prince William did not have enough to worry about with coming of age , press intrusion and his future kingship , he now finds himself at the centre of the biggest storm over royal security since 1982 , when the Queen found an intruder in her bedroom . ""
Binsane "" is how the Sun 's headline describes the police lapse that allowed an "" Osama madman "" in a peach dress to gatecrash the Prince 's 21st birthday party at Windsor Palace .
In fact , the uninvited guest was comedian Aaron Barschak , whose publicity stunt earned him photos on the front page of almost every national paper , a reprimand from police and a rash of insults .
He is a "" nut "" and a "" lunatic "" in the Sun , a "" fool "" in the Express , and "" filthy "" and a "" stand - up failure "" in the Mail .
But the real vitriol is reserved for Scotland Yard , whose security operation was a "" laughing stock "" , according to the Daily Mail .
Home secretary David Blunkett ordered an immediate report into the embarrassing incident , while Prince William himself was said to be "" absolutely livid "" , the Mirror reported .
The Daily Telegraph 's leader reflects the general tone .
So soon after MI5 's warning about an unconventional terrorist attack , "" police should have been particularly vigilant .
If these men can not spot an ' unconventional ' gatecrasher at a party , how can they be expected to protect their citizens from the machinations of global terrorism ?
"" the paper wonders .
The Mirror highlights "" the five blunders "" that allowed the "" notorious crank "" to get within touching distance of the prince .
These included Mr Barschak being able to climb the castle wall unchallenged before jumping on stage alongside the birthday boy .
Even then , "" a full minute elapsed before , prompted by the prince 's anxious glances , several Royal Protection officers - also in fancy dress - realised he was not a guest and dragged him away in handcuffs "" .
But the real worry , said the paper , was what might have happened if the intruder had been a real terrorist rather than a self - publicising comedian . ""
... he could have wiped out the Royal Family ... and Edward IX would now be King . ""
Now there 's a prospect that may fill royalist and republican alike with horror .

Nearly 150 players - including Tim Henman and Andre Agassi - are considering taking part in the rival tournaments , under proposals which Grand Slam sources describe as "" offensive "" ( the Telegraph ) and "" outrageous "" ( the Times ) .

KEEP TAX AND GM
DEBATES
ALIVE
The row over tax returned to haunt the prime minister today , despite strenuous efforts by Downing Street to bury the issue .
Mr Blair 's attempts to "" close down the debate on raising the top rate of income tax "" have been undermined by leading MPs , including education secretary Charles Clarke , who said there was a good argument for increasing tax thresholds .
Sacked environment minister Michael Meacher also pitched in , saying the government should consider whether a small percentage of top earners should pay more to provide "" better services for everyone else "" .
Mr Meacher is also at the centre of a fresh row over GM food production , and writes a column in the Mail as part of a two - page spread on what it calls "" Frankenstein foods "" .
The former minister claims the government played down research indicating that GM crops could be a health hazard and could harm the environment .
The Independent carries a front page story on the evolution of "" superweeds "" , which are resistant to the powerful weedkillers GM crops were designed to tolerate .
It means that "" bigger quantities of weedkillers - not less , as the biotechnology companies have claimed - will be needed in GM - crop fields "" .
But the Telegraph , in an editorial , says the public should trust the GM industry because it can have "" no commercial interest "" in poisoning its customers .

2003-06-24,"The home secretary today condemned the "" appalling failure "" of security that allowed an Osama bin Laden impersonator to gatecrash Prince William 's party at Windsor Castle .
David Blunkett offered his "" deep regret "" to the Royal Family over Saturday 's security breach , admitting that self - styled comedy terrorist Aaron Barschak was able to get "" unacceptably close "" to the Prince during celebrations for his 21st birthday . ""
The Metropolitan Commissioner has already apologised personally to the Royal Family and on behalf of the Government and this House , I too offer my deep regret to Her Majesty and the Royal Family for the events of Saturday evening , "" he said .
In a Commons statement outlining the findings of a preliminary six - page report by the Metropolitan Police , Mr Blunkett said Mr Barschak had been able to enter the castle grounds by climbing a steep bank , scaling a tree and leaping on to the castle wall . ""
As he advanced along the north terrace he was challenged by a contractor .
By this time he had changed into fancy dress , "" he said .
Mr Barscham "" presented as being slightly drunk "" and pretended he was a party guest who had become lost , so the contractor escorted him to a side entrance where a police officer was on duty . ""
The police officer , who had to remain at his post , asked the contractor to take Mr Barschak to the main entrance to the party .
There was no further challenge from either the police or other staff controlling access to the party .
Mr Barschak was able to get unacceptably close to Prince William . ""
"" Having appeared at the Prince 's side , he then made his way to the bar where a member of the castle staff challenged him .
He was handed over to the police , "" he said .
Mr Blunkett described Saturday night 's events as "" wholly unacceptable "" and told the House that lessons would be learnt .
The home secretary added : "" Mrs Barschak 's actions have exposed an appalling failure in the security at Windsor Castle which simply should not have happened . ""
He said a further , in - depth review was underway , led by Commander Frank Armstrong of the City of London police , which would determine what went wrong on the night and whether to take disciplinary action .
Mr Blunkett said the report would be available within four weeks and would be published .
The home secretary said that , in the meantime , an urgent review was being undertaken and further security work at Windsor Castle was being planned for the autumn .
Mr Blunkett appeared to place the blame for the security lapse on individual errors , saying that "" at this stage we have no reason to believe there was any substantial technical failure "" .
But shadow home secretary Oliver Letwin said blaming human error was not enough because a fail - safe system should have been put in place .
Mr Letwin said the incident acted as an "" important metaphor for wider failure "" and a minister responsible for homeland security should be introduced ."
2003-06-24,"Pressure to explain how a bearded man in a salmon - pink ballgown and fake beard could so easily have gatecrashed Prince William 's birthday partyat Windsor Castle at the weekend and got within feet of the royal family was mounting on the Metropolitan police last night .
It is widely regarded as the most disturbing breach of security since the Queen awoke to find Michael Fagan sitting at the end of her bed in Buckingham Palace in 1982 .
As an initial six - page report into Saturday 's incident landed on the desk of the home secretary , David Blunkett , yesterday and an official apology was issued by Scotland Yard , attention was focused on the elite bodyguards charged with protecting the royal family .
Mr Blunkett last night warned that heads might roll over the incident .
"" There is no question that after what happened , everyone in every position , all the way through counter - terrorism forces and royal protection , know their heads are on the block , "" he said .
But , he added , "" I 'm not at the moment looking for scapegoats , I am looking for answers to very difficult questions .
"" The incident did display a real need to tighten up general security around the royal family , and by dint of that for the rest of those who are at risk .
I think we deserve better from those who are employed to look after our interests . ""
But he rejected any suggestion that he should offer to resign , as Willie Whitelaw did after the Fagan incident .
"" I think it was very foolish of William Whitelaw to do that , because our job is to ensure that we learn the lessons from other people 's mistakes and avoid those mistakes being made again , "" he said .
Police chiefs have had to explain to the home secretary how Aaron Barschak was so easily able to dupe some of the country 's top police guards into thinking he was a legitimate party guest .
Mr Blunkett is due to make a statement on royal security in the Commons today .
It is understood that he may order a more in - depth investigation , depending on the contents of the initial review .
Amid deep concerns that the intruder could have been a gunman or a suicide bomber , the commissioner of the Metropolitan police , Sir John Stevens , yesterday apologised to the royal family for the "" appalling "" security lapse .
The Met 's assistant commissioner , David Veness , read out a statement shedding some light on how the incident happened .
He said Mr Barschak , 36 , had got into the castle precincts by scaling an embankment , climbing a tree , jumping on to a wall and reaching a terrace before talking his way past a police officer .
He is believed to have reached the outer walls through the grounds of St George 's School on the north side of the castle , and then scaled a 20-metre slope .
After that he is thought to have climbed one of the many beech or horse chestnut trees - some of which are 24 metres tall - which grow up from the slope and overhang the top of the castle walls .
From the top of one of these , he is thought to have jumped on to the castle walls and then on to the terrace just inside . ""
He was challenged by a contractor and escorted to a police point , "" Mr Veness said .
"" He gave what appeared to be a credible story and was allowed into the area of the castle where the party was taking place . ""
In our judgment , and with our duty to royal protection , there is no such thing as an acceptable proximity to the royal family , "" Mr Veness said .
"" This was far too close , and it 's wholly unacceptable .
This seems to have been an operational failure , which should not have happened . ""
He confirmed that an independent inquiry led by the City of London police commander , Frank Armstrong , had already been established to rigorously review all aspects of the security operation before making recommendations .
It was not clear what Mr Barschak said to get past the officers at the police security point , but he may have used his fancy dress as cover , claiming that he was part of the entertainment , or one of the guests who had gone out to get some air .
After getting inside the castle , he climbed on to the stage in St George 's Hall while Prince William was giving a speech , grabbed his microphone and launched into his stand - up comedy routine .
Mr Barschak told today 's Daily Mail that he kissed Prince William on both cheeks after performing the routine , but was only discovered by royal security when he then went to the bar for champagne .
He described the security as "" non - existent "" .
He said : "" I was carrying a bag which could have had a bomb in it .
I was just yards from the Queen and Prince Charles .
If I had been a real terrorist the entire royal family would have been wiped out . ""
After questioning , he was put into the custody of the Metropolitan police .
He was released on bail and is due to return to a London police station next month .
Mr Barschak told yesterday 's Sun newspaper that he had no regrets , and that it was better for security failures to be highlighted by a joker than by a terrorist .
"" I would rather security gets a big kick up the arse as a result of my actions than the whole thing goes up in smoke .
I 'm amazed I got in , "" he said .
"" Royal security is not all what I expected .
But William is a lovely boy , "" he said .
Cynics might suggest that the desire to publicise his Edinburgh Fringe show , Osama Likes
it Hot , which is now sold out , was of more concern to him than highlighting the security flaws in royal protection strategies .
The comedian , who took A - levels at the City of London school and speaks French and Spanish , has already performed a string of publicity stunts , bringing his "" comedy terrorism "" to public events and stage shows .
His victims have included the television presenter Graham Norton , London 's mayor , Ken Livingstone , and the comedian Terry Jones .
He was arrested last month when he threw a pot of red paint over Jake Chapman - one half of the controversial Turner Prize nominees , the Chapman brothers - while the artist was giving a talk about their new exhibition at the Modern Art Oxford gallery .
Mr Barschak 's flatmate , Ian Coult , 40 , an unemployed musician , described him as "" harmless "" .
He said : "" He has done daft things before and obviously I 've known about them , and it makes me very cross when he does these things . ""
But he is harmless .
He would n't have posed any risk to any of the royals .
He has n't got it in him . """

2003-06-24,"Spectators arriving at Wimbledon yesterday were subject to body searches for the first time as the championships got under way amid unprecedented security .
Record numbers of police officers and security guards will be on duty over the next fortnight in response to the increased terrorist threat since Britain joined the invasion of Iraq .
With several members of the royal family scheduled to attend , the Metropolitan police are also desperate to avoid any repeat of last weekend 's embarrassing security breach at Windsor Castle when a stand - up comedian dressed as Osama bin Laden gatecrashed Prince William 's 21st - birthday party .
Chief superintendent Des Stout , controller of operations at Wimbledon , said patrols around the club would be increased and that contingency plans were in place to deal with a major terrorist attack .
"" We have contingencies in place to deal with everything that is in our current knowledge , "" he said .
"" You can expect a more intensive security regime inside the club .
People are being searched , as are their bags , and some spectators may be delayed in the process .
The security operation is intended to avoid similar incidents to those last year which caused concern among the players .
In the first week of that tournament Albrecht Strohmeyer , a 34-year - old German who has stalked Serena Williams for years , was arrested outside the house where she was staying .
In the second week the prankster Karl Power and a colleague leapt on to Centre Court after a match involving Monica Seles and played a rally before escaping , pursued by security guards .
The incident raised serious concerns among the players ; Seles was stabbed in the back by a spectator during a match in Hamburg in 1993 .
Stout said measures were in place to prevent a repeat of either incident .
"" We have intelligence around a number of individuals who are infatuated with players .
We will be mindful of anybody we are made aware of through our intelligence process .
We are basing our assumptions on the intelligence but we are also wise enough to learn from last year . ""
Further changes include a limit on the number of tickets available on the gate for the middle Saturday to reduce the number of people queuing overnight .
Left - luggage areas have also been moved outside the All England complex .
Immigration officials from the Home Office are also working with the police , screening contractors and staff at the championships ."

2003-06-25,"The royal family would have to share some blame for the lapse in security at Windsor Castle because they asked for a "" lighter touch "" in policing at Prince William 's 21st birthday party , David Blunkett indicated yesterday .
The home secretary broke convention by making it clear that the royal family had gone out of their way to ensure that policing remained unobtrusive .
Sir John Stevens , the Metropolitan police commissioner , said his officers were "" devastated "" by the breach .
Mr Blunkett said : "" It is precisely because of the wish of the royal family to maintain informality ... that the lighter touch approach was agreed .
The difficulty in the final analysis ... was that they were at a fancy dress party .
There is a lesson , if ever there was one .
"" In an emergency Commons statement , Mr Blunkett expressed his "" deep regret "" to the Queen and to the royal family for the "" appaling failure in security "" which allowed the amateur comedian , Aaron Barschak , to kiss Prince William on the stage at his party .
Mr Blunkett made it clear that the royal family could not escape blame when he gave details of private negotiations over the level of policing at Saturday night 's fancy dress party , which had the theme of "" Out of Africa "" .
He told MPs : "" It is very important to bear in mind that we are talking about a family and decisions taken by them in relation to the level of surveillance and the particular avoidance of intrusion , particularly where there are invited guests and it is a family event .
"" People have spoken over the last 48 hours as though the royal family should have no say in this and that they should have expected a degree of intrusion which would have been unacceptable to them . ""
While Mr Blunkett indicated that the royal family would have to review their approach to security , he made it clear that the principal blame lay with police officers who failed to spot Barschak .
Electronic surveillance had worked , he said , indicating that Barschak was either filmed on CCTV or caught by special infrared cameras .
Mr Blunkett said : "" The technology that was put in place did not fail , so it is clearly a failure of the systems of checking , of human error , of failure to respond to the particular indications of intrusion and a failure to be able to ensure that after the initial checks had been made there were further continuing checks on identity within the castle itself . ""
The failures allowed Barschak to get "" unacceptably close "" to Prince William , who found himself being kissed by the comedian as he made his speech . ""
The Metropolitan police commissioner has already apologised personally to the royal family and on behalf of the government and this house , I too offer my deep regret to Her Majesty and the royal family , "" Mr Blunkett said .
All questions would be resolved by an inquiry which is being led by Commander Frank Armstrong of the City of London police .
The thought of an Osama bin Laden lookalike , in a pink dress with what he called a "" strategically placed wig "" , drew howls of laughter from MPs during Mr Blunkett 's statement .
The home secretary briefly joined in before saying : "" Actually , Mr Speaker , it 's quite serious . ""
Under pressure from the Conservatives , Mr Blunkett backed away from his warning on Monday that heads would have to roll when he said it would be wrong to make a scapegoat of a junior police officer .
"" It [ is ] very important that we [ do ] not have someone , particularly at a lowly level , who lost their job because of the wider failures to do the job better higher up the hierarchy , "" he said .
His statement came as Sir John Stevens promised to learn the lessons of the breach of security .
He said : "" The royal protection department is devastated by what took place at Windsor Castle over the weekend and it is for us to pick up the pieces of what went on to ensure lessons are learned in relation to that .
You have my word that that will take place . """
2003-06-25,"He may be a rank failure on the comedy circuit , he may be a loser in life and love , he may belong to the great unwashed , he may even have hooked up with a former stripper , but Aaron Barschak possesses something most of us have n't got .
Not only did he climb three walls and two gates to gatecrash Prince William 's 21st birthday party , he did so dressed as Osama bin Laden ( though he actually looked more like Michael Jackson ) , performed a comedy routine , kissed William on both cheeks , left to wild applause and headed off for the champagne bar .
That 's when he got arrested .
Barschak does n't care .
The Crown is unlikely to press charges against him , he has become a national treasure and front - page news .
Despite his transparent lack of talent , he has achieved his ambition to become famous .
Undeterred by decades of failure ( he wanted to be an actor , but ended up as a removal man and waiter ) , he has carried on in the face of his own lack of ability , finally winning our admiration by doing something most of us would never have dared do .
In short , Barschak has proved his chutzpah .
What is chutzpah ?
And how do you pronounce it ?
Well , last things first .
It is pronounced Khoots - pah :
imagine you are clearing your throat , preparing yourself for a really good spit ( think Paul Mariner on Match of the Day , if you 're old enough ) .
That 's the "" ch "" , and the rest spells itself .
It is a Yiddish word , with no English equivalent , and there is no better way to express audacity , daring and presumption .
Perhaps the best way of understanding it is to examine the people who have it in spades :
Eddie the Eagle ( a hopelessly talentless skier , but that did n't deter him )
; Bill Clinton ( his redefining of "" sexual relations "" was truly audacious ) ; Karl Power ( prankster extraordinaire , who managed to get himself into the Manchester United team picture , played on centre court at Wimbledon and went out to bat for England ) ;
Mohammed Saeed al - Sahaf ( Iraq 's minister of information , who insisted on television ""
There are no American infidels in Baghdad .
Never !
"" when we could see them in the backdrop ) ; the whole of Britart ( "" Believe me , my unmade bed really is as good as any Vermeer "" ) ;
Ruby Wax
( rifling her way through Imelda Marcos 's shoe closet ) , and Christine Hamilton ( simply for being Christine Hamilton ) .
Michael Winner , who knows more about chutzpah than most , is keen to help us out .
"" Chutzpah is two things .
It can be cheek and insolence .
But it can also be used to describe a derisory act , for example , someone who is selling something could say : ' What Chaime offered me was a chutzpah ! '
"" Hats off to Barschak , says Winner .
"" It had all the elements of chutzpah : the impertinence of intruding on a class way above your own ; the expertise of finding the way of doing it ; and it also had the ludicrousness of pitting the east- european immigrant , albeit one generation removed , against the royal family .
I think he should be thoroughly applauded . ""
Why do we associate Winner with chutzpah ? ""
Ah , I excel in it .
I 'm always doing impertinent things .
For example , when I was 14 I befriended the publisher Paul Hamlyn , who was an old boy at my school who had gone on to publish film books .
So I phoned all the film studios and said ' I 'm writing a book called Film - Making From the Children 's Angle ' , and all the studios welcomed me and I met the stars and that 's how I got to see how films were made .
I went back time and again and always ate for free .
Eventually , Paul phoned me and said ' I hear you 're going round saying you 're writing a book for me .
Give it a rest , would you ? '
We remained friends till he died . ""
The author Leo Rosten defines chutzpah as follows : a man kills both his parents and then throws himself at the court 's mercy on the grounds that he is an orphan .
There is also an old Jewish joke that illustrates chutzpah .
A Jewish grandmother is sitting on the beach with her beloved grandson when a freak wave sweeps him out to sea , where he is instantly devoured by the ocean .
The distraught woman sinks to her knees , wailing , pleading with God to spare the child 's life .
Suddenly , there is a celestial thunderclap and her prayers are answered .
Another wave gathers the boy up from the depths and plonks him safely , miraculously , beside the old lady , at which she turns her eyes heavenwards , and says : "" His cap 's missing . ""
Barschak 's brand of chutzpah is more than an attitude , it has an element of performance art to it .
Indeed , this will almost certainly turn out to be his greatest performance .
( At 36 , he is not thought to have a promising future as a stand - up - indeed , a close observer of the comedy circuit told me : "" As a stand - up comic , never in his wildest dreams could Barschak aspire to mediocrity . "" )
As with most chutzperians , Barschak 's act was not an end in itself - his performance at Prince William 's party ended with him advertising his live gigs at the Edinburgh festival later this year .
The political activist Peter Tatchell also employs chutzpah as a means to an end .
For example , earlier this year he stopped Tony Blair 's motorcade by running out , suffragette - style , in front of his limousine , ending up under the wheels .
It was a way of drawing attention to his protest against the invasion of Iraq .
Last year , he twice attempted a citizen 's arrest on Robert Mugabe , and got himself beaten up into the bargain .
I ring him to tell him he 's been voted a top chutzperian in the Guardian 's ( admittedly unofficial ) survey .
For once , he 's speechless .
But I think he 's pleased .
Why does he think that we think he 's got chutzpah ? ""
Well , I guess I 'm rather reluctant to show deference where many people think it is due , especially if there 's an issue of injustice involved .
"" Does he have any chutzpah role models ? ""
Oh yes .
Gandhi , Martin Luther King , Sylvia Pankhurst .
They did n't play politics by orthodox rules .
They were fearless in confronting the forces of oppression .
I 've tried to adapt their methods of non - violent direct action to the contemporary campaign for human rights . ""
George Galloway also features prominently in our list of great chutzperians .
He is delighted when I pass on the good news .
"" I strongly approve of chutzpah , "" says the controversial politician , currently suspended from the Labour party after making anti - war comments on television .
What does chutzpah mean to him ?
"" It means audacity .
I 've always followed the motto of the French revolutionary Danton - l'audace , encore l'audace , toujours l'audace .
And in my line of work , elan can make the difference .
I do venture into the lion 's den .
Sometimes I 'm bitten , but so far so good - I keep getting up again .
"" I tell him what I think makes him a great chutzperian - how he can smoke the fattest Cuban cigars and wear the most expensive designer suits , proclaim his socialism and not appear to be a hypocrite . ""
Others do things behind closed doors , "" he replies .
"" I prefer to openly acknowledge my belief that the devil should not possess all the best suits , and that if one has honestly earned the wherewithal to buy tobacco one should buy the best Havanas . ""
With magnificent chutzpah , Christine Hamilton has made a living from milking her infamy .
I 'm in the fortunate position of being able to tell her that she is one of the Guardian 's top chutzperians .
She squeals with delight . ""
Oh yes , everything I do displays chutzpah , "" she says .
"" It means you 've got balls and joie de vivre and a bit of cheek .
Oh , yes - I 've been the narrator in the Rocky Horror Show , bossy battleaxe in Jack and the Beanstalk , I 've even had a bath in strawberry jam for the British Heart Foundation .
The rumours that I drink to excess , by the way , are ridiculous .
I do everything to excess .
I drink with chutzpah .
I do everything with chutzpah . ""
One of the great things about people with chutzpah is that they like to talk about it .
Of course they do .
They love talking about themselves , their nerve , their excesses , their presumption , their amazing ability to achieve a great deal ( often with very little obvious talent ) .
With one obvious exception .
Reading about Barschak reminds me of a group of people with unequalled chutzpah - each year they take £ 35 m off us without a word of thanks , they have filched some of the world 's greatest paintings for their own private collections , are a law unto themselves and they act as if they own the bloody country .
But the Royal Family were , as ever , unavailable for comment ."
2003-06-26,"Poor Prince William .
At the University of St Andrews , the young diligent prince faces regular onslaughts from a curiously well - organised army of star - struck students .
What are their weapons ? ""
A quite sophisticated text messaging network has sprung up , "" one campus insider confided in the Daily Record .
"" If William is spotted anywhere in the town , then messages are sent out .
It starts off quite small .
The first messages are then forwarded to more girls and so on .
It just has a snowball effect .
Informing 100 girls of his movements takes just seconds . ""
The speed at which mobile coordination takes place has the potential to work as a tool to spur social , as well as political , change .
In his new book , social forecaster Howard Rheingold describes an emerging phenomenon of Smart Mobs .
Smart Mobs , according to Rheingold , "" cooperate in ways never before possible because they carry devices that possess both communication and computing capabilities "" .
In their haste to declare a new era , techno - enthusiasts often exaggerate .
There remains , however , a largely latent potential that coordination through mobile might give form to the expression of already existing social and political interests .
The use of mobile phones during the riots at the 1999 World Trade Organisation meeting in Seattle illustrated for many the potential for using mobile devices to coordinate political action , allowing activists to outwit the centralised radio system of the police .
Text messaging was also instrumental in organising the public demonstrations that forced Philippine President Joseph Estrada from office in January 2001 .
In countries where information is strictly controlled , the ubiquity of mobiles can pose a direct threat to the existing order .
China , for example , is the world 's biggest market for mobile phones : last November , the number of Chinese mobile users passed 200 million .
During a strict media and political blackout about the existence of Sars earlier this year , many Chinese people heard of the virus first through their mobile phone .
On February 8 , a text message "" There is a fatal flu in Guangzhou "" , was sent 40 m times , 41 m times the following day , and 45 m times the day after that .
As a direct result of the epidemic of texting , the media and subsequently the Chinese government were forced to admit the existence of the virus .
Closer to home , anecdotal evidence suggests that mobiles have been the coordinating force behind apparently spontaneous eruptions of public dissent , such as the congregation of schoolchildren in Downing Street in March to protest against the war in Iraq .
In the same month , British police took the trouble to confiscate mobile phones from a party of anti - war demonstrators travelling to a demonstration .
That the police are cracking down on activists who come equipped with mobiles - and are apparently empowered to do so under the provisions of the Terrorism Act 2000 - is a good indication that the authorities are taking its potential seriously .

2003-07-01,"The security lapse at Windsor Castle which saw an intruder gatecrash Prince William 's 21st birthday party has led to the removal of a senior police officer from his job , it emerged today .
The chief inspector who commanded the castle 's security , and is not being named by Scotland Yard , has been moved to other duties . ""
Following discussions , the chief inspector at Windsor Castle is to move to a new post within the Metropolitan police , "" a Scotland Yard spokesman said .
"" This should not be seen as pre - judging the outcome of the disciplinary inquiry , and is by mutual consent . ""
The new chief inspector at the castle will be Paul Seery , Scotland Yard added .
The change comes after the prince 's party on June 21 , when self - styled "" comedy terrorist "" Aaron Barschak broke through security .
Scotland Yard Commissioner Sir John Stevens last week said that no individual police officer would be "" picked on "" over the lapse .
"" When you are looking at something which has been a failure in totality like this it would be wrong to pick on any individual , "" he told a meeting of the Metropolitan police authority ."
2003-07-02,"The security lapse which allowed an intruder to gatecrash Prince William 's 21st birthday party claimed its first victim yesterday when a senior officer left his post at Windsor Castle .
Scotland Yard said the chief inspector had been transferred to another position in the Metropolitan police while a detailed investigation into the affair took place .
The Met has refused to name the officer who has been moved , or say where he will now be working .
A spokesman said he had moved "" by mutual consent "" and the transfer should not be seen as prejudging the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings .
The new chief inspector at the castle is Paul Seery , previously based in Hounslow , west London .
The lapse at the party on June 21 is regarded as the most disturbing breach of security since the Queen awoke to find Michael Fagan sitting at the end of her bed in Buckingham Palace in 1982 .
Dressed as Osama bin Laden , Aaron Barschak , 36 , got into the castle precincts by scaling a tree and jumping on to a wall .
He was challenged and escorted to a police point but gave what the Met has described as a "" credible story "" and was allowed into the party area .
He managed to get on to the stage when Prince William was making a speech .
In the immediate aftermath of the stunt , the home secretary , David Blunkett , said the officers involved knew their heads were on the block .
The Metropolitan police commissioner , Sir John Stevens , said the royal protection department was "" devastated "" by what had happened , but said no individual officer would be "" picked on "" for the lapse .
An inquiry led by Commander Frank Armstrong of the City of London police has begun ."
2003-07-10,"I started my degree at St Andrews University in autumn 1999 , long before any rumour about royalty joining our ranks .
The place has changed since the arrival of Prince William , as have the type of people choosing to study here .
There are now more Americans than before , and they are often extremely wealthy .
American girls , who are here in record numbers , are much maligned by many for being overly influenced in their decision to cross the pond by William 's presence .
St Andrews has always had a high number of female students , but now the girl - boy ratio is at its most visible .
There were four girls to every boy at the prestigious Kate Kennedy Club Opening Ball although William was not in attendance .
The truth is , that the mention of William in any context at St Andrews is seriously uncool .
If you happen to be friends with him that is fine , but otherwise he is simply not a subject people are keen to discuss .
Any comment implies that his presence affected your decision to study here , making you a fan , and a social climber .
Nothing could be worse than to be thought of as keen to meet William .
While I am sure that deep down most of us would have loved to have met him , I never did .
There was the odd party where I saw him sitting in the corner , but the thought of just going up to him and saying "" Hi "" never crossed my mind .
I am sure he would have been friendly enough , but it would have been social suicide .
I happened to spend this past year living on Hope Street - the same small street which William lived on .
I sometimes felt suffocated by the constant police patrols and big vans with darkened windows parked outside .
It just did not seem to me to be a normal student existence .
People would joke that Hope Street was the second - most protected street in Britain after Downing Street .
Perhaps that was true , but that did not stop my flatmate and me routinely climbing into his bedroom from the street when we forgot our keys .

2003-07-10,"The William effect I started my degree at St Andrews University in autumn 1999 , long before any rumour about royalty joining our ranks .
The place has changed since the arrival of Prince William , as have the type of people choosing to study here .
There are now more Americans than before , and they are often extremely wealthy .
American girls , who are here in record numbers , are much maligned by many for being overly influenced in their decision to cross the pond by William 's presence .
St Andrews has always had a high number of female students , but now the girl - boy ratio is at its most visible .
There were four girls to every boy at the prestigious Kate Kennedy Club Opening Ball although William was not in attendance .
The truth is , that the mention of William in any context at St Andrews is seriously uncool .
If you happen to be friends with him that is fine , but otherwise he is simply not a subject people are keen to discuss .
Any comment implies that his presence affected your decision to study here , making you a fan , and a social climber .
Nothing could be worse than to be thought of as keen to meet William .
While I am sure that deep down most of us would have loved to have met him , I never did .
There was the odd party where I saw him sitting in the corner , but the thought of just going up to him and saying "" Hi "" never crossed my mind .
I am sure he would have been friendly enough , but it would have been social suicide .
I happened to spend this past year living on Hope Street - the same small street which William lived on .
I sometimes felt suffocated by the constant police patrols and big vans with darkened windows parked outside .
It just did not seem to me to be a normal student existence .
People would joke that Hope Street was the second - most protected street in Britain after Downing Street .
Perhaps that was true , but that did not stop my flatmate and me routinely climbing into his bedroom from the street when we forgot our keys .
It always made me wonder whether the security was more relaxed than it looked .

Why it 's OK to be crap
On Tuesday a Daily Telegraph editorial deplored the reclassification in the new Collins English Dictionary of 70 "" previously taboo words "" .
Many , such as "" arse "" and "" bollocks "" , have been relabelled slang ; others , "" well - hung "" and "" come "" are now just informal .
The Telegraph sternly noted that frequency of use does not necessarily undo a taboo .
True enough .
The ubiquitous "" fuck "" is still called taboo in the dictionary .
Listen to the words in the street ( or office ) : you will far more frequently hear "" fuck "" and its derivatives than "" gangbang "" or "" bumsucking "" ( two of the words that the Collins lexicographer thinks have lost all shock value ) .
Perhaps you envision all taboo words sliding slowly towards general admissibility .
However , this is not historically inevitable .
The earliest record of "" cunt "" ( the ultimate taboo word ) is from 1230 in the London street name "" Gropecuntlane "" , suggesting that the word was once publicly acceptable .
Its variant form , "" queynte "" , features in Chaucer 's Miller 's Tale , where it seems ordinarily bawdy ( perhaps about as naughty as "" bum "" or "" willy "" for us ) .
On the other hand , there is a word like "" crap "" .
I grew up thinking this rude word was guaranteed to offend parents .
Yet now it is nudging its way into public acceptability .
A couple of months ago I distinctly heard Ed Grundy on The Archers tell his mother that he had had a "" crap holiday "" in Ayia Napa .
Clary did not seem to blink ( radiophonically speaking ) .
Then , when health minister Alan Milburn resigned from the government , he told Guardian political editor Michael White that all speculation about his motives was "" crap "" .
Germaine Greer , speaking to BBC2 viewers from the Hay Literary Festival , described one of the books she was discussing as "" crap "" ( to a roll of relieved laughter from the audience ) .
"" Crap "" is now the word for talking no - nonsense .
Yet how do we decide whether usage in the media confirms or denies a taboo ?
On Newsnight Review last week , right - wing Times columnist Michael Gove distinctly used the word "" fuckwit "" .
I flinched .
It is one of the 16 that the Collins Dictionary still reckons taboo .
Was he trying to be demotic ?
Or was he assuming that the word no longer shocks culture - loving adults ?
Collins says that even "" fuck "" "" will soon cease to be considered taboo "" .
Yet one natural process always restores the primal power of these words .
You think they are everyday , then you have children .
Suddenly , I guarantee , you feel the shock of them anew .

Those magnificent OAPs ...
Wild feats of British pluck often have a humdrum cause , and yesterday 's transatlantic flight by two pensioners in a homemade aircraft was no exception .
The moral , says 68-year - old Jack Berkin after landfall in sun - drenched Blackpool , was to think about how you 're going to get your kit plane home before you set about building it .
He and his fellow traveller Denis Wood , also 68 , glued the final section of their tiny £ 80,000-odd Velocity into place in Dayton , Ohio , in honour of the Wright brothers - swooping round an anniversary rally four times to show spectators how the kit 's principles ( rear propeller and front flaps ) were the same as the Wright Flyers ' . ""
Then it was time to go home , "" says Berkin , a retired health administrator with about 300 hours ' flying experience .
"" It 's 5,000 miles , but flying ourselves was definitely cheaper than dismantling the plane and freighting her back .
We might have hired a pilot , but why should someone else have all the fun ? ""
The fun included only one goosebump , appropriately on the leg from Gander in Newfoundland , when Wood 's boots proved too big for the plane .
Berkin explains : "" We were wearing immersion suits over the Arctic ocean - huge great things with massive boots about twice as big as our feet .
When Denis did the equivalent of stamping on the clutch to lower the landing gear for Greenland , everything seized .
It took us about 30 seconds to think through what had gone wrong , "" he says .
"" Luckily it cleared and worked the second time , otherwise the flight would have ended there .
No one 's going to go all the way to Narsarsuaq to salvage a kit plane crumpled up after landing without wheels .
"" Noise on the five - day flight , with eight stops between Dayton and Blackpool , kept conversation limited , but Wood had radio chats with startled colleagues from his days as a British Airways pilot .
Either side of Greenland , the insect - like aircraft was too distant and too low , at 11,500 ft , to contact ground control .
"" We called up passing airliners instead , "" says Wood , who has a bus pass but , like Jack , prefers to get around in a Mercedes when not flying .
"" I spoke to quite a few planes 35,000 ft above us who kindly passed our whereabouts on . ""
The silver flyers hopped down from Blackpool to the home counties later yesterday , following the motorways just as the House of Commons was debating widening them .
Now they are home , they only plan short hops .
Someone else can mark the Amy Johnson centenary , they say .
Martin Wainwright Winner takes it all Abba .
The word says it all .
What a happy accident that when Benny , Bjorn , Anna - Frid , and Agnetha formed their group 30 years ago , their initials should spell out such a simple , almost pre - verbal word .
With the two bs written back to back , it is the perfect palindrome .
Was there ever a better international symbol of gentle harmony ?
Maybe not , but since the group ceased trading in 1982 , the Abba brand has been hijacked by hundreds of "" tribute "" acts , for whom the word "" harmony "" comes to mind about as readily as the word "" svelte "" does when thinking of Michael Winner .
Not particularly within the groups themselves , but in relations between the acts - and I write as someone who has recently been unwittingly caught up in what I am afraid we must call Abbawars .
In the Abba tribute world , you see , the "" A "" word prefixes all .
Abba Girls , Abbababes , Abbamania , Abbasolutely Live , Abbacab
; those are the kind of names these copyists choose .
( Actually , the last named is a mini - cab firm in Darlington , but the principle is the same ) .
Not only do you get your helping of Abba fairy dust by association , you get to be first in Showcall , the directory of artistes and attractions .
Which is how I came to see Abba Girls perform at a wedding reception .
In my book about showbiz at the sticky end , I pronounced them half - decent , which I thought non - controversial , until I received an email from a Stacy Collins of Abbababes , who said my book was being used on Abba websites "" as a tool to undermine other acts "" .
Stacy wrote from her Norwich base : "" We have pages of slaggings on a couple of chat rooms . ""
She has indeed .
Some of them are personal and rather vicious .
I had not realised copying Abba was such a fiercely competitive business , but you can see why .
Some backing tapes and two girls who can wear satin bell - bottoms convincingly
- almost all the tributes now dispense with the two boring bearded ones who wrote all the tunes - and you have an act .
No wonder the Abbalike business is booming .
A statistician friend tells me that if it continues to grow exponentially , within 30 years every second person in Britain will be paying "" tribute "" to Abba .
And the rest of us will be cowering at home , in mortal fear of becoming the target of Abbamaniacs .

2003-07-15,"The "" comedy terrorist "" who gatecrashed Prince William 's 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle will not face prosecution , it emerged yesterday .
A file on the security breach was passed to the crown prosecution service , whose solicitors advised police that Aaron Barschak , 37 , should not be charged .
The decision may come as a relief to some officers who were on duty , as the embarrassing details of the incident will not now be recounted in court .
Prosecution sources say that the CPS solicitors had to consider whether there was a realistic chance of prosecuting Mr Barschak for one or more of four offences - burglary , threatening behaviour , criminal trespass and assault .
They decided that there was "" insufficient evidence "" to charge him .
After learning that he would face no action , Mr Barschak said his stunt had brought him celebrity status .
"" I do n't speak to any of my friends any more .
I 'm far too famous for them .
I get people in the street coming up to me and it 's a terrible strain , "" he told the radio station LBC News 1152 .
The lapse at the party on June 21 is regarded as the most disturbing breach of security since Michael Fagan entered the Queen 's bedroom at Buckingham Palace in 1982 .
Dressed as Osama bin Laden , Mr Barschak got into the castle precincts by scaling a tree .
He was challenged and escorted to a police point but gave what the Metropolitan police described as a "" credible story "" and was allowed into the party area .
He managed to plant kisses on Prince William 's cheeks .
An inquiry led by Commander Frank Armstrong of the City of London police has begun and Chief Inspector Mark Goddard , a senior officer who was in charge of security at Windsor , has been moved .
At least nine police officers are under disciplinary investigation over the incident .
Mr Barschak , who carried out the stunt to promote his comedy act , has already told his side of the story to the Daily Mail for a five - figure fee ."

2003-07-16,"There are , apparently , a lot of "" nutters "" about these days .
Only last week , Jeremy Clarkson referred with some admiration to the resident test driver on his Top Gear programme on BBC2 as "" going mental - really he 's an absolute nutter "" .
And we can be assured that this is a completely different "" nutter "" to the publicity - seeking stand - up comedian who was so described by the Sun and the News of the World after he tricked his way past royal security at Prince William 's birthday party .
Fortunately , these "" nutters "" are harmless .
Unlike the maniacs , madmen , psychos and loonies who , if the headline writers are to be believed , do most of the really bad stuff .
Indeed , one could be forgiven for believing that if we could just get rid of the mad , nothing bad would ever happen again .
As Louise Borg , mental health service "" survivor "" and activist , says : "" A lot of us look forward to the day when we see lurid tabloid headlines like : ' Sane person goes sane and shoots six people in cafe . '
But then that would be just too scary , would n't it ? ""
When the Department of Health recently published its three - yearly survey of public attitudes towards people with mental health problems , campaigners and professionals alike expressed disappointment but little surprise .
According to the survey , people are becoming more afraid and less tolerant of those with mental health problems .
Indeed , the survey showed a marked worsening in attitudes since 2000 .
This came as a particular blow to the Royal College of Psychiatrists ( RCP ) , which has been running a five - year anti - stigma campaign that draws to a close this October .
Many campaigners blame the negative trend on the draft mental health bill and the government rhetoric that surrounded its presentation .
But others believe that the proposed reforms could only exist because of a prevailing culture of prejudice .
Dave Harper , senior lecturer in clinical psychology at the University of East London , has written extensively on the power of language in stigmatising mental health patients .
He says : "" The survey is reflective of a deep - seated culture of discrimination , and that can be seen in the way language from and around mental heath is used and abused .
It 's so obvious it hardly needs saying , but discriminatory language around race or gender or sexual preference is , in the main , a thing of the past .
But not in mental health , where everyone from tabloid editors to elected politicians consider words such as ' mad ' or ' nutter ' to be common currency . ""
In 2001 , Charles Clarke , now education secretary but then chairman of the Labour party , said of Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith 's newly - appointed shadow cabinet : "" When he puts known nutters in the operation you just think , ' Blimey , what world are we living in ? '
"" Earlier this year , London mayor Ken Livingstone was reported to have said to Darren Johnson , the former Green party mayoral candidate : "" I always knew the entire Green party were nutters , but you have turned out to be even more of a lunatic than I originally thought .
"" Is this offensive , or simple plain speaking ?
After all , if words such as mad or nutter are so commonly used , surely any discriminatory power they have is diluted ?
Is thinking too much about the words people use simply political correctness , which may be an idea that has had its time ?
Harper disagrees .
He says : "" The thing about madness is it is shorthand more often than not for behaviour which is inexplicable or horrifying .
As a consequence , the mad become , in the public consciousness , capable of horrifying things .
And as for ' political correctness ' , it is a term of abuse used by people who want to carry on being discriminatory .
"" In the view of some professionals and activists , however , it is not only psychiatric slang that forms and maintains negative attitudes toward mental health problems .
When he was foreign secretary , Jack Straw said of Osama Bin Laden : "" He is obviously psychotic and paranoid as well ... a key characteristic of people who are psychotic and paranoid is their sense of complete detachment from the sufferings of others . ""
Straw not only misused the word psychotic , but he also correlated violence and terrorism with mental illness .
Borg , from London , was less then impressed with the comment , but says it was not the first time a politician had used the language and supposed credibility of psychiatry to demonise - nor will it be the last .
"" It does annoy me when politicians call the likes of Bin Laden psychotic , "" she says .
"" I do n't know of anyone who experiences what psychiatry calls psychosis who could be that organised .
It is simply an indefensible attempt to put over with greater force the heinousness of their actions .
And , in doing it , they are implying that any dreadful act must be the product of a sick mind . ""
Harper believes that the imagery of mental health can prevent people with problems making use of services .
"" People can get scared of themselves , "" he says .
"" I know of someone with a diagnosis of schizophrenia who became very scared that it meant she was likely to do something violent or terrible - ' like you read about ' .
""
The chairman of the RCP 's anti - stigma campaign , Arthur Crisp , says misuse of language makes it all the harder to challenge stigma .
Part of the problem for the campaign has been securing funding for new initiatives .
It has produced CD - Roms for schoolchildren , books , advertising campaigns and websites , but Crisp says : "" It 's hard to get money , because of the stigma attached to mental illness .
People do n't want to be associated with the issue and are less likely to become involved because of the public perception . ""
As for the role played by the Crisp adds : "" I think it 's reasonable to expect a little more from people like this in the public eye - particularly , perhaps , from those who are seen as in part responsible for the draft mental health bill . ""
So if campaigns are having limited impact , what else can be done ?
Many believe that trying to reclaim some of the stigmatising language is a step in the right direction .
Phil Barker , an author , campaigner and nurse for 35 years , says : "" I think reclaiming marginalising language is one of the most powerful strategies available .
These people in the US have started calling themselves Fatties Inc , which goes a little way to taking the sting out of the pejorative .
In the 1980s , there was a group in the US called Crazy Folks .
They took the issue of the language seriously and sought to regain lost territory . ""
Borg agrees .
"" Language is crucial to self - definition and one 's frame of reference , "" she says .
"" For example , I refer to myself as a voice - hearer , not a schizophrenic .
If you want to know my frame of reference , you would have to ask me , because ' voice - hearer ' does n't immediately tell you . ""
The problem with this is that it demands some kind of engagement from a pretty uninterested public .
Harper feels there will not be a breakthrough until someone with money takes a high - profile politician or tabloid newspaper to court - something he concedes is pretty unlikely .
In the meantime , he thinks it makes sense to try to take back some power where you feel you have none . ""
Of course , it 's an uphill battle , but trying to reclaim some of the lost ground is important and perhaps has other benefits , "" Harper says .
"" Look at [ campaign group ] Mad Pride .
They seek to celebrate aspects of a culture of having had some mental health problems .
And , in so doing , they try to attack some of the prejudice .
Most importantly , they do it with humour . """

But no one , alas , loves Barschak now .
He has outstayed his 15 minutes of fame , and even the merkin he wore on that fateful day can not cover his lack of material or talent as a stand - up .

2003-08-14,"The self - styled "" comedy terrorist "" , Aaron Barschak , spoke to a police officer and set off a series of intruder alarms as he gatecrashed Prince William 's 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle , it was revealed today .
A police report into the incident depicted an almost total failure of security at the event , despite the fact that every principal member of the royal family except Prince Edward was in the castle at the time .
Mr Barschak , 37 , climbed a tree to get over the castle wall and made it as far as the main dining hall .
He was ordering champagne at an adjacent bar when he was detained .
In total , he spent one hour and 20 minutes at large in the castle and set off seven alarms .
Commander Frank Armstrong of City of London Police , who authored the report , said there appeared to be an "" over reliance on the physical security provided by the castle wall "" .
He recommended a review of security at all royal residences .
The Metropolitan police commissioner , Sir John Stevens , said the report made for "" disturbing reading "" , and that police were devastated by the lapse . ""
This incident has served as a grave wake - up call and we must now ensure the right steps are taken so that security can not be breached in this way in the future , "" he said .
The report reveals that Mr Barschak had not travelled to Windsor with the intention of gatecrashing the party .
Rather he had been in the town to drum up publicity for his show Osama
Like it Hot at the Edinburgh festival .
After performing to crowds in a black beard , turban and peach dress , he changed into a grey suit and was walking to the railway station when he decided to scale the castle walls .
Once inside , he changed into his Osama costume , climbed over a gate and set off the first of the seven alarms .
After setting off the sixth , he met a contractor who he told that he was a lost guest and asked the way back to the party .
The two then walked to the main door , encountering a police officer on the way , and Mr Barschak went alone into the main dining hall where he interrupted Prince William mid - speech .
Then went to the bar .
His movements , which set off alarms in a "" geographical sequence "" according to the report , were also recorded on CCTV .
It concluded that a patrolling police officer responding to the alarms or security cameras at any point along his route would have encountered Mr Barschak and prevented his further intrusion .
The home secretary , David Blunkett , said in a statement that he welcomed the report . ""
The commissioner has assured me that significant lessons have been learnt from this incident and that the important service that the police play in protecting the royal family will be further improved , "" he said .
Disciplinary investigations are underway in the case of eight officers policing the event ."
2003-08-15,"Aaron Barschak , the self - styled "" comedy terrorist "" who gatecrashed Prince William 's 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle , triggered at least seven alarms but no police response .
The report of the investigation into his farcical breach of security , released yesterday , reveals a catalogue of complacency and errors .
It recommends creating a new offence of "" trespass into royal / government premises "" and suggests the army should be deployed more frequently on royal protection duties .
Despite the fact that most of the royal family were present , the report by Commander Frank Armstrong notes that resources and supervision of the police control room were inadequate .
One alarm had even been disabled by officers because it was blocked by a contractor 's vehicle .
The officer in charge of the operation , Chief Inspector Mark Goddard , had left the event at 9 pm that evening .
Dressed in his Osama Bin Laden costume - black beard , turban and pink dress - Mr Barschak , 37 , had performed outside the castle gates as the media filmed guests arriving for Prince William 's fancy - dress party on June 21 .
The stand - up comic 's intention was to generate publicity for his forthcoming show at the Edinburgh fringe festival .
After changing back into his suit in a nearby pub , he set off for the station , but had a change of heart and decided to enter the castle by an alternative route .
He scaled an embankment , climbed two trees , hoisted himself on to a wall and dropped down the other side .
At 10.04pm he activated his first alarm .
It was ignored by officers in the control room .
Climbing into bushes in the castle grounds , Mr Barschak changed back into his Bin Laden outfit .
His progress towards the party was recorded several times on CCTV cameras and triggered more alarms .
After bumping into a contractor and pretending to be a lost guest , Mr Barshak was escorted to a side door of the castle 's Great Hall where a police officer allowed him through .
By then it was 11 pm .
Entering through the bar , he interrupted Prince William , who was making a speech , and gave an impromptu performance .
"" I stepped forward , gave William a kiss on both cheeks , shouted ' We all love you ' and left the stage to rapturous applause , "" he subsequently explained .
Commander Armstrong 's report , which makes 28 recommendations , includes one implicit criticism of the royal family .
"" The theme was fancy dress ' Out of Africa ' , "" it says .
"" This could have made identification of guests difficult . ""
But the report focuses on the multiple failures in police security . ""
Barschak activated a number of alarms in geographical sequence and is recorded on CCTV inside the castle as he made his way ... to the location of the party , "" it states .
"" There appears to have been no operational police response to these alarm activations or the CCTV recordings .
A patrolling officer in this area responding to the alarms and CCTV would have encountered Barschak and would have prevented his further intrusion .
"" The home secretary , David Blunkett , yesterday said : "" The main thrust of Commander Armstrong 's report is that the security lapse was caused by operational errors on the part of the police . ""
Disciplinary investigations are under way in the case of eight officers and the management of the policing arrangements at Windsor has changed at chief inspector level .
I accept the commissioner 's judgment that , for the time being , no further disciplinary action should be taken against any other officers . ""
The report also revealed there had been a similar security lapse at St James ' Palace six months earlier .
An intruder breached the perimeter but was caught and no further action was taken .
Mr Barschak was eventually arrested on suspicion of burglary but there was no prosecution .
The only legal recourse for the royal family would have been to sue him for trespass .

2003-08-18,"Several years ago - just before Prince William started his A - levels - a friendly neighbour heard our burglar alarm going off .
She went round to the back of the house and found the doors to the living room open .
Inside , on the carpet , she could see a jemmy .
No doubt about a plan of action .
Retreat .
Call the police .
Call my wife at work .
Jean was back in 40 minutes .
Together , she and the neighbour scoured the house , saw what was missing , and waited .
Call 999 again .
Still no police .
The neighbour went home .
My wife made a cup of tea .
Two hours trundled by .
And then the burglar alarm next door - on the other side - began shrilling , too .
As my wife went into the street to look , a man carrying a television came out of next door 's side gate .
"" Excuse me , "" Jean said , with a politeness that made the words sound incongruous even as they passed her lips , "" I think you may have just broken into my home . ""
The man , clutching TV to chest , began to walk away - pursued by irate wife shouting : "" Stop , thief ! ""
Nobody came to help .
Cars swept by .
The human caravan went faster and faster - until the man dropped the television in the gutter and did a runner , sprinting into the distance .
There was still no sign of Scotland Yard 's finest , nor would there be for another hour - and - a - half .
Which brings us , inescapably , to the night of Wills 's revelry at Windsor Castle , and to the comedic mock Arab who triggered seven unheeded alarms and starred in five unnoticed videos while the cops did sweet nothing - and thus to the wilder shores of human lethargy , confusion and ineptitude .
Do the police actually answer alarms now ?
Or watch screens showing anything other than The Bill ?
They send you automatic victim letters offering counselling in case of possible distress .
( "" Dear Prince or Madam ... "")
After false alarms their computer churns out single sheets threatening not to respond again ; assuming they responded in the first place .
But what happens , really happens , when the bell rings ?
Is anybody home ?
The goodish news , perhaps , is one of Labour egalitarian triumph after six years in office .
Now the royals get the same treatment as the rest of us .
The more nuanced news - oft repeated , always soon forgotten - is how easily chaos stalks the length and breadth of human affairs .
Chaos has just enjoyed another bumper week .
Out go the lights from Manhattan to Buffalo , presumably as some kind of bizarre Bushie reassurance to the people of Mosul and Baghdad .
Brothers , you are not alone .
We ca n't fix our own damned electrics , let alone yours .
Up in smoke - at least at the report stage - go tens of millions of pounds ' investment in Yarl 's Wood , the detention centre without a sprinkler system , run by Group 4 , the groupies one QC calls a "" national laughing stock "" .
Down the tubes - with maximum , ludicrous publicity - goes an "" international arms dealer "" who bought his kit from Russia 's internal security service and sold it to the FBI .
Or maybe that was Aaron Barschak ...
But Windsor makes the case most starkly .
Here is a royal birthday party with the highest of gossip column profiles ( the sort of thing for which Osama bin Laden might read Nigel Dempster ) .
Yet there is no communicated security plan .
The chief inspector pushes off home half an hour before the revels begin .
Thames Valley police , guarding the castle walls , ca n't rustle up a car to take Barschak to the nick .
A 28-point inquiry recommends having a few more blokes around next time and having them trained .
It is a shambles .
Even Sir John Stevens ( David Blunkett 's least favourite top cop ) can do nothing but grovel : "" We must be grateful it was an attention - seeker , not an intruder with more sinister purposes . ""
Indeed , how true .
Do n't stop there , though .
Make a few modest and necessary connections .
The police force charged with keeping Prince William safe for posterity and a jug of Pimm 's is the same force issuing awful warnings about terrorism .
The FBI nabbing Hemant Lakhani after 20 expensive
, drawn - out months stands on America 's parallel front line .
A Group 4 prison , upon request , will doubtless welcome all - comers .
We are not , in sum , talking about a world neatly divided between efficiency and imbecility .
We live in a world where the two perpetually conjoin .
And that , so far , is the missing ingredient from the week 's other great inquiry and pending report .
Who needs conspiracy theories when there is no evident conspiracy , just bumbling and back - covering in true chaos mode ?
You can get lost in this jungle of foreground and forget the chaotic background of revealed reality .
Dr David Kelly did n't doubt that there were weapons of mass destruction ; he just thought there were fewer of them , less threatening and less ready than legend .
The upper echelons of MI6 did n't agree : they produced - and signed off - on documents of a rather more frightening nature .
Messrs Blair , Hoon and Campbell , perhaps , were genuinely scared on behalf of Joe Public ( or moved by still more shuddersome dossiers from the CIA ) .
But , it seems , they were all up the creek .
Even Dr Kelly .
There were no such weapons left .
The supposedly macabre scientist they called "" Dr Germ "" was probably suffering from hay fever .
The documents in the case would n't have fooled a Windsor policemen , let alone Niger customs .
The supreme Iraqi technicians who would have launched their missiles ca n't put the lights back on .
There is "" questionable "" , as Andrew Gilligan would say , and there is "" wrong "" .
Score a big , fat one in the "" wrong "" column - and watch it come over the castle wall in a pink dress as the bells start ringing . p.preston@theguardian.com"
2003-08-18,"Criticisms The "" gatecrashing "" incident at Windsor Castle , when a self - styled "" comedy terrorist "" gained access to Prince William 's 21st birthday party , uncovered serious weaknesses in the policing of royal events .
Inadequate planning allowed a member of the general public to get dangerously close to members of the royal family , none of whom had been furnished with prepared remarks .
The incident also launched the comedy career of Aaron Barschak , an embarrassment for which the Metropolitan police must bear partial responsibility .
Failings
In his perambulations around Windsor Castle , Barschak set off no fewer than seven alarms , nearly equalling the evening 's record .
Only Prince Harry set off more .
Members of the royal protection squad consistently failed to recognise Barschak as Osama bin Laden : one believed him to be dressed as George Harrison , another thought he was Fidel Castro and the officer who escorted Barschak into the Great Hall repeatedly asked him whether he was meant to be Ben or Jerry .
The fact that none of these costumes was appropriate for an Africa - themed party went unnoticed .
The command structure in place was wholly inadequate for an event of the magnitude of the heir to the throne 's 21st birthday .
Insiders claim security was at a level more befitting Princess Michael of Kent 's annual nuns and Nazis bash , or even the tea following Prince Andrew 's dedication of a new hedge .
Recommendations · Security outside the walls of Windsor Castle should be reviewed and improved , although care should be taken not to impede the royal family 's interaction with the public .
A 10-metre wide shoot - on - sight "" dead zone "" along the wall 's perimeter has been deemed inappropriate .
Five metres should be sufficient .
· New legislation is needed to make "" comedy terrorism "" an offence punishable by life imprisonment .
· Royals should be effectively banned from giving or attending fancy dress parties , with the possible exception of the state opening of parliament . ·
All trees within the grounds of Windsor Castle should be removed . ·
Undercover officers should be deployed to mingle with crowds at royal events , with orders to arrest anyone who is trying to be funny .
· Members of the royal family should not be allowed to party together , especially in situations where Prince Edward is the sole non - attendee .
A major security breach in such circumstances could have disastrous consequences .
In future Edward should be compelled to attend all gatherings where the first through fourth in line for the throne are present .
When this is not possible he should be followed at all times by a protection officer armed with a poisoned dart ."
2003-09-02,"Prince Charles ' private secretary has admitted St James 's Palace has failed to provide the press with enough access to Prince William over the past two years , after the relationship between journalists and the palace threatened to break down .
Sir Michael Peat has now promised to give the press information about Prince William at least once a term , in an effort to ease the unrest among tabloid papers over the lack of access to the heir to the throne .
In a letter to Les Hinton , the chairman of the newspaper editors ' code of practice committee , Sir Michael conceded that not enough material about the prince had been made available since October 2001 .
"" Steps have been taken to address this and I hope that I am right in thinking that the recent interviews and photographs were generally well received , "" he wrote .
"" It is our intention to ensure that information about Prince William is , from now on , made available at least once a term , to reflect the growing interest in Prince William in his own right . ""
Newspaper editors agreed not to publish paparazzi shots of Prince William during his time at St Andrews university in exchange for access to official photographs and stories .
But the agreement threatened to break down earlier this year when the News of the World , frustrated by the lack of official access to the prince , published photographs of him returning from a trip to Tesco laden down with shopping .
Prince Charles ' aides complained about the story , but the following weekend the Mail on Sunday followed suit with pictures of the prince out walking with a female friend and a story implying the pair enjoyed a close relationship .
There was also fierce criticism from the press about the way St James 's Palace handled Prince William 's 21st birthday interview in May.
Tabloid editors reacted furiously after Daily Record editor Peter Cox claimed to have negotiated an exclusive interview , and Prince Charles ' PR team was hastily forced to make it more widely available .
"" There was a feeling that we had kept our side of the bargain but they had not kept theirs , "" said one royal correspondent .
"" I think one of the real tests was when the pictures of the prince out shopping were published .
That was a real wake - up call for the palace , and to their credit things have improved a lot in the past few months .
We got the interview for Prince William 's birthday and there has been a lot of access to Prince Harry this year . ""
Prince Charles ' press secretary , Colleen Harris , said the promised access was more likely to consist of photo opportunities than a repeat of the interview the prince gave to mark his 21st birthday .
"" It 's simply a case of reverting back to the original arrangement we had , "" she said .
"" After the News of the World published its pictures , it looked as though that agreement was in jeopardy .
We had never before set out the amount of access that should be provided under that agreement so we now we have said it will be once a term , "" she added .
Mr Hinton , who is also executive chairman of News International , welcomed Sir Michael 's proposal , saying Prince William was a "" public figure in his own right for whom a total media blackout would be entirely inappropriate "" .
"" I can confirm that the industry continues to accept the balance set out in September 2000 .
We will , of course , continue to respect the privacy of Prince William - as with any student or young person - under the terms of the [ PCC ] code , "" he wrote in a letter to Sir Michael . ""
And we will continue to ensure that , as far as reasonably possible , a level of restraint is exercised which avoids the creation of a paparazzi market at St Andrews .
"" Many royal correspondents are also concerned about who will replace Ms Harris as Prince Charles ' press secretary when she leaves the job at the end of next month .
"" That 's a real concern .
Colleen has been pretty good about making sure we are kept informed and it will be interesting to see who takes over from her , "" said one .

2003-09-03,"St James 's Palace has written to the editor of the Mail on Sunday to complain about a series of articles accusing Prince William of killing deer , including an endangered species .
Prince Charles 's aides contacted Peter Wright about the stories , which sparked a storm of protest from animal rights groups despite a denial from St James 's Palace .
The first story , published on August 10 , alleged that Prince William had killed a dik - dik dwarf deer - described by the paper as a "" bambi - like animal "" - with a Masai warrior spear on a recent trip to Kenya .
The palace insisted the story was not true , but it was picked up by media outlets all over the world and provoked widespread condemnation of the prince , including a letter from the pop star Pink urging him to change his ways .
The following week , the Mail on Sunday published a second article claiming Prince William had killed a near extinct species of deer , the huemel , with a morphine - loaded dart gun three years ago .
The story , headlined "" Oops , I did it again ! "" ,
alleged that the prince had accidentally hit an elderly huemel deer with the dart while working on a conservation project during his gap year in Chile .
That story too was denied by the palace , which has confirmed it has written to Wright about the reports .
But the Mail on Sunday is standing by its stories .
"" We have responded to St James 's Palace and explained that we have first - hand accounts of both incidents and that we have no reason to doubt them , "" said Wright .
The clash follows a promise from the palace to provide access to the prince at least once a term after newspapers complained they were being frozen out .
Editors agreed to steer clear of paparazzi shots of the prince during his four years at university in exchange for regular updates from the palace .
But the agreement threatened to break down earlier this year when , frustrated by the lack of official access , the News of the World published pictures of the prince carrying his shopping home from Tesco .

At Glasgow high court he admitted sending letters containing a powder , which he claimed was either anthrax or ricin , to various people and organisations .

It contained sodium hydroxide - caustic soda , which can burn the skin and damage the throat and stomach lining if inhaled .
These packages were sent to Cherie Blair and to Margaret Ashcroft , an aide to the Liberal Democrat MSP Mike Rumbles .

2003-10-24,"Manchester United press chief Patrick Harverson is swapping Old Trafford for Clarence House after a surprise move to become Prince Charles 's communications secretary .
The former Financial Times journalist , who cut a reputation for breaking boardroom sports stories , is swapping one high pressure environment for another and will be expected to oversee all the prince 's media relations , as well as those of Prince William and Prince Harry .
Prince Charles 's press secretary , Colleen Harris , who leaves next week , announced her resignation in the summer saying she wanted to spend more time with her teenage sons .
She will take up the post of director of communications at the Commission for Racial Equality .
Mrs Harris 's resignation came just six months after Prince Charles 's closest PR adviser and former deputy private secretary , Mark Bolland , quit as his media consultant .
Mr Bolland was credited with restoring the prince 's image following the death of Diana , Princess of Wales but his style and astute dealings with the media , particularly the tabloids , proved unpopular among some courtiers at St James 's Palace .
Earlier this week Mr Bolland hit out at the prince 's advisers for being "" totally out of touch "" .
He also accused them of being "" frightened "" and lacking "" visibility , energy , dynamism and an understanding of the way a modern , democratic society works in an age of global communication "" .
Mr Harverson , who has been at Manchester United for three years and was thought to be close to the former chief executive , Peter Kenyon , who left earlier this year to join Chelsea , will take on the newly created role of communications secretary in February .
A permanent press secretary will also be appointed to work with Mr Harverson , who is well respected throughout the football world for balancing the notoriously fiery demands of the manager , Sir Alex Ferguson , with the interests of the plc board and the press .
"" I am very excited by the prospect of working for the Prince of Wales and taking forward the communications strategy at Clarence House , "" said Mr Harveson in a statement .
"" I have enjoyed a wonderful three years at Manchester United and will be very sad to leave Old Trafford , but I am looking forward hugely to my new job and the challenges ahead , "" he added .

2003-10-28,"Clarence House confirmed last night that Prince William would meet Paul Burrell to discuss the revelations in the former royal butler 's book and to head off the possibility of further disclosures .
The meeting , likely within weeks , will be held despite reports of the Queen 's reservations and escalating vituperation from both sides .
As his book , A Royal Duty , went on sale yesterday in Britain and the US , Mr Burrell appeared on broadcasting outlets to face robust questioning .
Claiming he had been close to suicide because of the royal family 's indifference , he suggested an invitation to meet the Prince of Wales following his acquittal on charges of stealing from the royal family a year ago would have stopped him disclosing intimate correspondence or writing his book .
He told a BBC Radio 5 Live interviewer : "" To take me into the fold , yes , not just leave me hanging out to dry .
A cup of tea at Highgrove [ the prince 's home ] would have stopped me .
This is n't about money .
It is not just [ revenge ] .
It is about many other things too .
It is about putting these documents in the public domain .
This is an important book . ""
He added : "" I have been on this rollercoaster of madness ...
My name has been trashed , my family has been put through hell , and I have been to the brink of suicide ...
I am a human being too , and I need to put the record straight . ""
He told a television interviewer he wanted to speak to the princes "" to give them a piece of my mind and ask them why they personally did not help me when I needed help at the worst point of my life ...
I never had any intention to hurt them .
I have known them since they were small children .
I did care ...

"" It would be "" fine "" with him if the Queen attended the meeting with Prince William .

2003-10-31,"A schoolboy who sent a bottle of aromatherapy oil laced with caustic soda to Cherie Blair and a letter apparently containing a deadly poison to Prince William was detained today for three years .
Paul Smith , 17 , was recruited over the internet by a Scottish terrorist organisation to send the items .
Smith also admitted sending letters containing a powder , which he claimed was either anthrax or ricin , to various people and organisations , including the House of Commons , Scotland Yard , the Scottish Parliament , the Home Office and the BBC .
He stood expressionless as sentence was passed at the high court in Edinburgh .
Lord Kingarth said the teenager had become "" involved in a sinister and sustained campaign which was calculated to cause and did cause considerable distress and alarm "" .
He sentenced Smith to three years in a young offenders ' institution with a 12-month supervision order on his release .
The teenager , of High Mains Avenue , Dumbarton , West Dunbartonshire , sent a letter to Prince William 's hall of residence at the University of St Andrews in Fife , the high court in Glasgow heard last month .
He also admitted sending the contaminated oil to the prime minister 's wife at 10 Downing Street .
Smith was just 15 when he sent 44 letters between August 20 2001 , and February last year .
The teenager had been groomed over the internet by the head of an anti - English Scottish terrorist organisation , which can not be named for legal reasons , and had been ordered to send the packages , Smith 's defence counsel told the court .
Smith also pleaded guilty to sending packages containing a substance which claimed to be a eucalyptus aromatherapy oil among with instructions to rub the substance onto the face and hands .
It contained sodium hydroxide - better known as caustic soda - which can burn the skin and damage the throat and stomach lining if inhaled .
These packages were sent to Mrs Blair and to Margaret Ashcroft , an aide to Liberal Democrat MSP Mike Rumbles .
No - one was injured by the items .
Edgar Prais QC , defending , told the court his client had been "" naive , gullible and immature "" , but not "" callous "" .
Mr Prais said Smith 's involvement was not out of any attraction to direct action but out of a genuine concern for the social and political well - being of others . ""
He is not in any sense a terrorism junkie , "" he said .
The defendant had a "" bright school future "" but since his arrest had experience bouts of absence from school due to sickness , feelings of stress and what Mr Prais described as fear and depression .
Passing sentence , Lord Kingarth told Smith , a first time offender : "" You come from a good supportive family and circle of friends with a good academic record and with a bright future .
"" I also take account of what was said in your defence that you came under the malign influence and direction of someone apparently significantly older , whose extreme political views you do not share now even if you did then . ""
It was a person by whom it seems clear you were used . ""
Although you are a bright young man you are possessed with a certain naivety .
"" The judge said Smith 's crimes "" could not properly be described in any sense as mere youthful indiscretions or pranks "" .
Lord Kingarth said : "" There was clear intention to cause personal injury . ""
He added that background reports found it was uncertain whether Smith had professed remorse for his offences .
"" You became involved in a sinister and sustained campaign which was calculated to cause and did cause considerable distress and alarm to a number of people and a very considerable disruption . """
2003-10-31,""" Comedy terrorist "" Aaron Barschak was facing jail yesterday after being convicted of a paint attack on Turner Prize - nominated artist Jake Chapman .
The 37-year - old splattered red oil paint over Chapman and one of his artworks at the Modern Art Oxford gallery .
Barschak , who gatecrashed Prince William 's 21st birthday party earlier this year , denied criminal damage , claiming he was "" creating a work of art "" .
But district judge Brian Loosley , at Oxford magistrates court , found the comedian guilty after a one - day trial .
Mr Loosley said : "" I may well want to pass a custodial sentence to reflect my displeasure .
I 'm not prepared to tolerate damage to works of art in Oxford or anywhere else . ""
An exhibition by Chapman and his brother , Dinos , called The Rape of Creativity , featured cartoon heads superimposed on etchings by Goya .
Witnesses said Barschak gatecrashed a talk by the brothers on May 30 this year and hurled the paint at Chapman shouting "" Viva Goya "" .
Barschak , from Golders Green , north London , told the police that he was making his own piece of art in the same way the Chapmans had adapted another artist 's work .
He said he intended to enter his "" artwork "" for the Turner Prize .
"" It 's an improvement on Chapman 's painting . ""
Adjourning sentencing , the judge ordered Barschak to pay £ 300 costs .
The Chapmans ' adaptations of Goya 's Disasters of War etchings are on show in Tate Britain 's Turner Prize exhibition .
The damaged work , not part of the series , is in storage ."
2003-11-01,"A youth who sent a letter claiming to contain the poison ricin to Prince William , and a bottle of aromatherapy oil laced with caustic soda to Cherie Blair , was yesterday sentenced to three years ' detention .
Paul Smith , 17 , sent apparently poisonous letters and dangerous packages to politicians and other figures of note after he was recruited over the internet to an anti - English terrorist organisation .
Smith , from Dumbarton , Dunbartonshire , was 15 when he began a six month campaign of sending 44 apparently poisonous letters to , among others , the Commons , the Scottish parliament , the Home Office and the BBC .
At the high court in Edinburgh , Lord Kingarth sentenced him to three years in a young offender 's institute .
Smith had become "" involved in a sinister and sustained campaign which was calculated to cause and did cause considerable distress and alarm "" , the judge said .
"" You came under the malign influence and direction of someone apparently significantly older , whose extreme political views you do not share now , even if you did then . ""
Lord Kingarth turned down pleas for leniency , saying that Smith 's actions could not be described as "" youthful idealism or pranks "" .
Smith pleaded guilty to two offences at the high court in Glasgow last month .
He admitted causing a breach of the peace by sending eight "" anthrax "" and 36 "" ricin "" letters , and culpable of reckless conduct by sending the oil laced with caustic soda .
His defence counsel , Edgar Prais QC , told the court that Smith had sent the letters after being groomed by an anti - English terrorist organisation , which can not be named for legal reasons .
He sent eucalyptus oil laced with sodium hydroxide to Mrs Blair and Margaret Ashcroft , an aide to Mike Rumbles , an English Liberal Democrat member of the Scottish parliament .
The court heard that the oil could have caused serious damage had Smith 's instructions to apply it to the face and hands been followed .
Mr Prais told the court his client had originally been motivated out of concern for others , but , in his naivety , he had allowed himself to become involved with a sinister campaign led by a tiny group . ""
Paul Smith is in no sense a terrorism junkie , "" said Mr Prais .
"" What changed his concern for the well - being of others into a crime is basically an exploitation and use by others of Paul Smith 's childish naivety and immaturity . ""
Earlier the court heard that when Smith was only 14 he had founded a political party on the internet called the Scottish People 's Workers Socialist party , which had a manifesto of republicanism , nuclear disarmament and the introduction of non - denominational schools in Scotland .
It was at this time that he came into contact with the terrorist group .
Mr Prais said : "" He was somebody ripe for grooming .
If it had not been for the [ terrorist group ] he would not be here .
"" Smith was apprehended by police when investigators spotted a large number of emails between him and another person , who can not be named .
When police officers arrived at his home with a search warrant he confessed ."

But District Judge Brian Loosley said at the original trial : "" I am not prepared to tolerate damage to works of art . ""
This was a publicity stunt and not a genuine attempt by you to create a work of art .
You caused substantial damage to the painting , to the gallery , the floor and the walls . ""
An exhibition by Chapman and his brother Dinos , called The Rape of Creativity , featured cartoon heads superimposed on etchings by Goya .
Witnesses said Barschak gatecrashed a talk by the brothers on May 30 and hurled the paint at Jake Chapman , his work and the gallery walls , shouting : "" Viva Goya ! ""
During police interviews , Barschak said he was making his own piece of art , in the same way that the Chapmans had adapted another artist 's work .
He said he intended to enter it for the Turner Prize .
He added : "" It 's an improvement on Mr Chapman 's painting
and it 's an improvement on the wall as well .
"" The Chapmans ' adaptations of Goya 's Disasters of War etchings are on show in the Tate Britain 's Turner Prize exhibition .
The damaged work - not part of the series - is in storage ."

2004-04-01,"Prince Charles today threatened to sever official relations with the Sun after the paper apparently broke an agreement to leave Prince William in peace following an skiing photocall on Sunday .
The front page of today 's Sun carries a photograph of the prince with fellow student Kate Middleton at the Swiss ski resort of Klosters under the banner headline ""
Finally ... Wills gets a girl "" .
Over the next four pages billed as a "" world exclusive : the royal romance "" , the prince is pictured again with a young woman the paper says is "" his first serious girlfriend "" .
Royal aides are angry at the apparent breach of a media agreement to leave William alone following an an official photocall on Sunday , when he posed with his father and joked with photographers about their skiing abilities .
A spokeswoman for the prince said he was "" very disappointed "" by the apparent breach of the agreement , adding that the Sun would have to "" face the consequences "" of its actions - although there would be no formal complaint .
"" They do understand that they have broken the agreement and they are aware they will have to face the consequences .
It 's not set in stone but that could include being excluded from photocalls , "" she said .
The publication of the photographs is the first major problem encountered by the Prince of Wales 's new communications secretary , Paddy Harverson , since he took up his post earlier this year .
Mr Harverson said today he was "" unhappy "" about the use of the pictures , provided by the well known celebrity photographer Jason Fraser .
"" I 'm asking newspapers to continue to abide by the agreement , "" he added .
There is also a wider agreement between the press and Buckingham Palace to ensure that the royal princes are allowed to continue their third - level education without their privacy being intruded .
However , last year relations between the tabloids and the palace became strained with protests from the royal press corps over the lack of access to Prince William on his 21st birthday .
Reporters and editors complained that the palace was reneging on its side of the entente , which involved giving regular official access to both princes at key milestones during their university schooling .
The latest agreement was reached last September , following an admission by Prince Charles 's private secretary , Sir Michael Peat , that St James 's Palace had failed to give the press sufficient access to William during his time at university .
In a letter to Les Hinton , the chairman of the newspaper editors ' code of practice committee , Sir Michael promised to provide information about the student prince at least once a term in an effort to ease unrest among tabloid newspapers over the lack of access to the heir to the throne .
In its editorial today the Sun said the pictures were published in the public interest and that William was a mature adult .
"" One of William 's girlfriends could become Queen one day .
Her subjects will be entitled to know all about her .
"" it said .
The newspaper added there had been public interest in Charles ' romantic interests before he married Princess Diana .
At the official photocall at the weekend , William revealed what appeared to be a new - found confidence in front of the cameras .
High up in the mountains at the start of his stay in the Alpine destination , he laughed throughout and joked with photographers .
With his arm affectionately thrust around Prince Charles ' shoulders , the prince took control of the photo - opportunity , spoke more than Charles and was at ease with the 50-strong media pack .
Prince Charles is understood to be upset at the photographs after co - operating with the official photocall on Sunday , when he made it clear he hoped to be left in peace for the remainder of the holiday .
Asked by the photographers to recommend good skiing routes in Klosters , Charles made plain his desire to get shot of the press . ""
The route to Zurich is very nice , "" he quipped .
A Sun spokeswoman said : "" Our story about Prince William and his girlfriend Kate Middleton is 100 % true .
Therefore , there is a strong public interest in publishing these delightful photographs . ""
However , the Sun is irritated that its royal photographer , Arthur Edwards MBE , has been banned from royal events .
"" We all know he takes the royal family 's favourite photographs and we shall be launching an ' Our Arthur is innocent ' campaign tomorrow . "" · To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 · If you are writing a comment for publication , please mark clearly "" for publication "" ."
2004-04-02,"The royal family yesterday banned the Sun newspaper from taking official pictures of Prince William after it broke the informal agreement between the palace and the media by publishing pictures of the prince on the Swiss ski slopes with a girlfriend .
Since the newspaper spread the photographs of William and fellow St Andrews University student Kate Middleton , 21 , over five pages - and will still have access to future agency pictures - the unprecedented temporary ban is unlikely to have much effect .
Instead , the Sun responded to the royal outrage and the publicity it generated by insisting it would stand by its story .
It said it would launch an
Our Arthur is Innocent campaign in support of its long - standing royal photographer , Arthur Edwards , who will suffer under the ban even though the photographs were taken by a paparazzo .
"" Our story is 100 % true , therefore there is a strong public interest in publishing these delightful photographs , "" a spokeswoman said .
Palace officials have long feared that the unofficial pact with the British media to safeguard the privacy of princes William and Harry would break down at the first sign of a girlfriend .
The ban on the Sun - described as an "" exclusion from some future opportunities "" - was regarded as a warning to other tabloids .
Paddy Harverson , Prince Charles 's communications secretary , said : "" It will be a nuisance for the Sun because newspapers always like to take their own photographs .
We are very unhappy about what the newspaper did .
This is a private skiing holiday which the prince and his father are having with their friends .
"" I would hope our agreement can still survive because it serves the interests of the media and the public , although I am realistic and prepared for future press intrusions . ""
As usual , Charles and William appeared before reporters and photographers at the resort of Klosters on Sunday expecting that they would be left alone for the rest of their stay .
They appeared relaxed and there was no sign of Ms Middleton .
The pictures published yesterday showed William and his apparent girlfriend sharing a lift up the slopes and joking with friends .
There was no first public kiss , the goal of paparazzi around the world , but it was clear that the relationship had been known about for some time .
The Sun also published smaller photographs of the prince and Ms Middleton chatting with fellow students and a larger photograph of Ms Middleton in a see - through lace top and black bra modelling for charity at a student fashion show .
It disclosed that the prince had paid £ 200 for a ringside seat at the show and that the couple had been spending time together since she broke up with her former boyfriend several months ago .
They share a rented cottage - which the newspaper named - and have apparently stayed together at a cottage on the Balmoral estate .
William and Ms Middleton , the daughter of Michael Middleton , a businessman , have known each other since starting at St Andrews .
They both studied history of art , though the prince now studies geography .
They shared lodgings with other students last year and Ms Middleton was invited to the prince 's 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle in June .
Mr Middleton told journalists at the family home in Bucklebury , near Newbury : "" I do n't talk to the press . """

2004-04-05,"When Lady Diana Spencer became engaged , an uncle went on News at Ten to confirm that she was a virgin .
Now her elder son 's first girlfriend is suffering the same patronising intrusion .
The Virgin Princess , claimed yesterday 's News Of The World across two of the five pages devoted to Prince William 's mate Kate .
The revelation last week of this young lady 's name by Sun snapper Arthur Edwards MBE led to the photographer being banned from future Alpine photocalls .
But this punishment failed to deter another paper from reporting that Kate in Klosters would be followed by Jessica in Kenya .
And now we have to read about The Virgin Princess : the adjective lascivious , the noun premature nonsense .
The moment long feared by Princes Charles and William has come .
His private life is now public .
The sex - kittens are out of the bag .
For several years , the young Windsor brothers were the beneficiaries of media discretion unprecedented since the invention of instant picture transmission and satellite telephones .
They were able to live out their adolescence and , in William 's case , college days with a degree of anonymity that their descendants and biographers may come to see as astonishing .
This was because they had suffered a horrendous and horrifically publicised bereavement .
Most of Britain - even , reluctantly , the tabloid press - became social workers , granting them a protection order .
But this emergency outbreak of decency always would , and should , have its limits .
As adults , the princes could no longer expect protection from the flashbulbs .
Besides compassion , the only reason for allowing the Prince of Wales 's offspring an exception from the general rules of celebrity would be deference .
In Japan and Monaco in recent times , princes have been allowed an invisibility denied tennis players or film stars .
But this tradition of one rule for the famous and one rule for the rulers was ended in Britain in the 80s by , as it happens , the mother of William and Harry .
Knowingly and excitedly , until she had things to hide , Diana created the idea of the pop - star monarchy and this is part of her inheritance to her children .
They may wish it otherwise , but her boys are now seen not as the continuation of an ancient , divine line , but as young millionaire celebrities , subject to the same interest and coverage as Wayne Rooney or Britney Spears .
In fact , there is , apart from post - Diana compassion and royal deference , another case for leaving William to ski and snog in peace .
Why not allow more privacy for all young stars , Wayne and Britney as well ?
But the problem for the royals is that the only privacy agreements that journalists are likely to respect and the public to support are based on the idea that there will only be coverage of activities relevant to a person 's job .
For example , there 's broad support for the view that what happens in the bedroom is not always relevant to what goes on in the boardroom .
However , if William has a job , it is to romance women and , ultimately , procreate , so ensuring the continuation of the dynasty that gives him his only significance .
When the actor Alan Davies refuses to discuss his girlfriend with a Sun reporter buzzing at his intercom ( as happened last week )
Davies has a case ; shagging , while often closely linked to acting , is not inherently connected with it .
William Windsor , though , ca n't easily make this distinction .
His profession is to meet and breed , while waiting for granny and dad to die .
This does not mean that all the prince 's kisses should be open season for the snappers - any decent human being would hope that he can be left alone - but he presents the hardest of cases for protection from the press .
In a way that applies to almost no other celebrity , his private life is his public role .
This is the horror of the position into which he was born .
The paradox for William and any women attracted to him - and even more so for the father who would like to shield him from scrutiny - is that it 's their supporters who are causing the problem .
Admirers of Tony Blair might shun publications that contain coverage he found offensive , but it 's Palace fans who pay for the petrol of the cars chasing Prince William down Lovers ' Lane .
Republicans would support the idea of invisible princes , being genuinely indifferent to who Wills kisses .
Those most eagerly buying the magazines and newspapers containing the snatched pictures are the people who dream of watching him become King William on TV and run form books on who might be his future queen .
Diana , although she could not have anticipated the scale of interest in her , chose a royal role .
William , who got it by an accident of blood , deserves more sympathy .
But the fact that every snog is seen as a possible date with destiny is not the fault of the media , but of the way that monarchy works .
comment@theguardian.com"
2004-04-17,"M15 and Scotland Yard are to vet applicants for jobs with the royal household , it was revealed yesterday .
The Independent Security Commission will recommend tough scrutiny measures in the wake of recent embarrassing breaches - an undercover journalist being taken on as a royal footman ; and a comic in fancy dress gatecrashing Prince William 's 21st birthday .
The increased global terrorist threat from al - Qaida and related groups has also put royal security under the microscope .
Applicants will be asked to agree to searching checks on their finances - bank statements , mortgages and credit ratings - and to have their family and friends looked into and questioned , before they can be considered for employment by Buckingham Palace or any other royal residence .
This voluntary "" developed vetting "" is used for certain jobs in Downing Street , the Ministry of Defence , the Foreign Office , and other sensitivepositions .
Until now , each royal household ran its own checks , and some jobs had much lower vetting than others .
All positions will now come under one system .
The prime minister set up the commission , chaired by the leading judge Dame Elizabeth Butler - Sloss , after Daily Mirror reporter Ryan Parry worked as a Buckingham Palace footman for two months before George Bush 's state visit in November .
Dame Butler - Sloss has spent the past four months investigating every aspect of royal security , and her report is expected within weeks .
The Metropolitan police , which in the past has not checked personal references for royal posts , confirmed that the reporter had no criminal record or terrorist link .
But a palace personnel officer apparently checked out his back ground by phoning a pub in north Wales where he claimed to have worked .
When staff could not recall him , a regular vouched for him .
Concerns were also raised when self - styled "" comedy terrorist "" Aaron Barschak got into Prince William 's party .
In February 1994 , Jim Miller , a naked paraglider , landed on Buckingham Palace roof ; the same month a burglar stole heirlooms from Prince Charles ' apartments in St James 's Palace .
The most notorious incident was 23 years ago when Michael Fagan got into the Queen 's bedroom and spoke with her before being persuaded to leave ."
2004-04-20,"It sounds like every advertiser 's dream : to have your product modelled in front of the world 's press by the most eligible young man in the world .
But the pictures of Prince William playing water polo in a pair of tight - fitting Speedo trunks may prove a mixed blessing for the sportswear manufacturer .
The micro shorts are more likely to reinforce the Speedo stereotype - as personified by Ben Stiller 's hapless male nurse in Meet the Parents - than spark a new high street craze for the range , according to some fashion experts .
"" I think it will only confirm most men 's suspicions about Speedos - that they are fundamentally not a good thing , "" said Dylan Jones , the editor of GQ .
"" They are very old fashioned and stink of the 1970s - quite literally in some cases .
They do n't show off men 's parts in a particularly good light , even if you are well endowed .
Brazilian and Italian men can get away with this look , but that 's only because they are Brazilian and Italian . ""
Prince William was pictured making his debut in the Scottish Universities water polo squad at the Celtic Nations tournament in Cardiff .
His Speedos of choice , called Cuba Splice , cost £ 15 .
Made out of a shiny "" anti - grab "" material designed especially for water polo , they are at the cheaper end of the Speedo range , which goes up to £ 250 for a full "" bodyskin "" .
Speedo 's flagship high street store in London reported no extra trade following publication of the pictures , but Paul Phedo , the associate marketing director of Speedo International , said the company had been "" inundated with inquiries "" following the weekend 's media coverage . ""
Speedo is worn by top athletes around the world , but it 's good to know Speedo is also fit for a future king , "" he said .
"" Prince William is an icon for many young people and we 're really pleased he chose Speedo .
We 've been surprised to receive so many calls , not just from this country but from as far away as Brazil . ""
But it was unfortunate for Speedo that the prince was pictured in the "" old school "" tight trunks at a time when the company is moving into extreme sports and lifestyle wear . ""
The image of the guy in spray - on trunks doing athletic looking dives is a bit dated , "" said Anthony Noguera , the editor of Arena .
"" The Speedo range is an awful lot wider than that
and they have been trying really hard to build themselves up as an extreme sports and lifestyle brand .
If only he had been pictured wearing three - quarter length baggy boxer shorts .
"" But I do n't think they can be too pissed off when effectively the most famous male in the world is pictured wearing their trunks .
That ca n't be bad for the brand .
It might make millions of young guys whose girlfriends fancy Prince William go out and buy Speedos . ""
The last high - profile public figure to be snapped in his Speedos was Tony Blair while on holiday in Barbados last year .
At the time , the Guardian described him as committing "" style suicide "" , but it did not stop him being voted the world 's coolest politician in a poll of under-30s .
In Meet the Parents , male nurse Gaylord Focker - played by Ben Stiller - is humiliated in front of his future in - laws when he is forced to borrow a pair of tiny Speedos to play water polo . ""
What happens when you dive into cold water ?
Major shrinkage .
Therefore the ever popular Speedo should be taken off your list when planning a trip to the beach or public swimming pool , "" said fashion writer Chris Rovny on US website Askmen.com .
"" Unless you are a competitive swimmer , you really do n't need the aerodynamics .
Out of 100 women interviewed , the Speedo was the second runner - up as the most notable fashion faux - pas , with 25 % of the votes .
Let 's face it , not all of us have the body of an Adonis .
So by wearing a Speedo , you might be revealing a little more than you should be and covering up might not be such a bad idea . ""
But Speedo remains the market leader among swimming professionals in the UK , with around 65 % of the market .
"" It 's still the most famous water - based active brand there is , "" says Arena 's Noguera .
"" They have got an awful lot of respect in terms of a sports specific fashion range .
They are completely ubiquitous . ""
But Prince William is n't quite up to date .
The very latest Cuba Splice trunks , launched in February , have Speedo written in lower case .
The prince 's logo is in capitals .
Doubtless a new pair has already arrived in the post . ·

Nothing personal against the happy couple - I often have this problem with pictures from Klosters , and it 's the same with St Tropez .
I can hardly bear to look at them because posh people have the most appalling taste in sunglasses .
All that money , and William is wearing hideous , totally five years ago swimming - goggle - style wraparounds that tilt upwards at either side of the face .
They give him - an undeniably good - looking boy - a distinct air of rodent .
Less rat pack , more rat - who's - joined - the - mafia .
This is the trouble with sunglasses .
They tend to pigeonhole you without you even realising it .
Posh people with sporty pretensions wear old - school Oakley 's .
People who see themselves as young and up for it -
this is not necessarily a good category , by the way ; I 'm thinking Jordan - wear funny colours , such as retro yellow or pink diamanté .
You get a lot of those at festivals .
And people who last looked at a fashion magazine in about 1988 are still wearing tortoiseshell .
Honestly , it 's a minefield out there .
Probably the most acceptable category right now is the big , black , old - fashioned - glamour - girl style .
Kate Moss wears it - in fact , all famous models wear it - and if there 's one thing a famous model knows about , it 's sunglasses ,
so for once that 's not a bad recommendation .
Go for very large , and very dark , and then work with what looks good on you .
Tempting though it is to buy a bit of Chanel or Gucci simply because it 's the one time you can afford the label , try not to be led astray by the shiny initials on the side .
You 're better than that , ladies ."
2004-06-11,"Frances Shand Kydd , the mother of Diana , Princess of Wales , was laid to rest yesterday in a ceremony attended by her grandsons , Princes William and Harry .
Prince William read a passage from the Bible to the requiem mass at St Columba 's Cathedral in Oban , Argyll .
His voice appeared to falter as he read five verses from Romans .
Mrs Shand Kydd was later buried in a private ceremony at Pennyfuir cemetery , near Oban .
The 600 mourners at the cathedral were led by Earl Spencer , Mrs Shand Kydd 's son , who denied any rift between his mother and Diana .
He told the congregation : "" My mother was an open book - a woman who was afraid of nothing and of nobody , somebody not interested in convention but in truth and fun .
She believed in equality and decency and had no time for self pity . ""
Although Mrs Shand Kydd had not spoken to her daughter for several months at the time of the latter 's death in 1997 , Earl Spencer said that the princess 's will showed how dear she had held her mother . ""
The true love Diana had for her mother was evident in her will .
She left my mother executor and principal guardian of her sons .
Any tensions they may have had were typical tensions between a mother and a daughter , "" he said .
Earl Spencer said there was "" much ill - informed speculation "" about Mrs Shand Kydd 's divorce from his father .
After the readings , Canon Donald MacKay said that Mrs Shand Kydd , who lost two children - Diana , and a son , John , 10 hours after he was born - had helped many people through their grief : "" So Frances the public person , who had allowed her name to be used by many charities and good causes , was always busy being there for strangers in their time of crisis .
She knew what they were going through . ""
Mrs Shand Kydd died on June 3 at her home on the Isle of Seil , off the coast of Oban , aged 68 , after a long illness .
After her burial there was a family gathering at the modest Corran Hall in Oban ."
2004-06-14,"The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and Clarifications column , Thursday June 24 2004
In the report below we say that "" the palace "" had established that Prince William only arrived in Kenya after the Mail 's first report was published .
In fact , he was already in the country .
We say the newspaper had suggested that Prince William was fluent in Swahili .
It did not .
It said he was learning the language .
We also say that it had been established that Prince William 's friend , William Craig , had killed a deer .
No such claim was made .
The Prince of Wales 's new communications adviser has vowed to take a "" more determined "" line against inaccurate and damaging newspaper stories after securing an apology from the Mail on Sunday yesterday over allegations that Prince William speared a deer in cold blood .
After a battle with Clarence House that has lasted since the original story appeared last August , the newspaper finally was forced to make a rare public admittance that its story - which was picked up around the world and led to a letter - writing campaign against the prince by the pop star Pink - was without foundation .
It printed an apology on page two , which said that , having investigated Prince William 's complaint "" we are happy to accept his position "" that two stories it wrote about him were wrong and that it should have put the allegations contained in the first article to him in advance of publication .
"" We apologise to Prince William . ""
The drawn - out saga began on August 10 last year when the Mail on Sunday ran a story on page three , which was trailed on the front , headlined William Kills Bambi Deer with Masai Warrior Spear .
While the prince is known to enjoy foxhunting , the palace believed the story was particularly damaging .
It detailed how the prince , while visiting Kenya , had slain the dik - dik deer , which it described as being no more than 14 inches tall .
It relied on quotes from an 18-year - old Masai warrior , implying he had seen the prince kill the deer .
It also featured quotes from animal rights groups , one of which said : "" That animal had a right to live a life in peace . ""
The Mail on Sunday did not seek a response from the prince 's spokesman before running the story .
The palace complained about the story immediately , and was in discussions with the paper during the week after it was published .
But in the following Sunday 's edition , the MoS ran another story under the headline : ""
Oops , I did it again - after slaughtering Bambi , how William shot dead a near - extinct deer by mistake "" .
In a secondary article it described the "" blood lust that shames Prince William "" .
In the second article , it was alleged that the prince had killed a rare breed of deer by accident during his gap year in Chile , taking part in an Operation Raleigh project .
The story said the prince had been tracking the deer , shot it with a tranquilliser gun , and the animal had subsequently died .
It also alleged that the prince , Operation Raleigh and the Chilean government had conspired to cover up the story .
Unusually for the palace - which has traditionally turned the other cheek to the tabloid press on the grounds that the most dignified response was no response at all - a detailed and protracted investigation was mounted into the story .
It quickly established that the prince had only arrived in Kenya the day after the first article was published ; that he did not , as the story suggested , speak fluent Swahili ; and that killing a deer with a Masai warrior spear would have required a high degree of skill , not possessed by the prince .
Curiously , it was also established that a deer had been killed by a friend of the prince , William Craig , who does speak fluent Swahili .
The young Masai warrior denied having alleged to the Mail on Sunday that Prince William had killed the deer .
Investigating the second story , it was established that the only time that a deer had been tracked , darted and killed in Chile in the latter part of 2000 was on September 26 , a month before Prince William arrived .
The deer 's death was reported to the Chilean government 's conservation department , which suspended all darting operations until May the following year .
Despite the mounting evidence that comprehensively undermined the Mail on Sunday 's stories , the paper persisted with its defence that the stories were true .
It is also understood to have made extensive efforts retrospectively to prove the allegations .
Eventually , on March 3 this year , the palace went to the Press Complaints Commission , which brokered the deal that resulted in yesterday 's apology .
Paddy Harverson , who took over as communications secretary for the Prince of Wales in February after heading the PR team at Manchester United , said the experience had been frustrating .
He said : "" We were angry that the Mail on Sunday did not give us a chance to respond to the original allegation , which seemed to us not to be good journalistic practice .
"" We were also unhappy that the newspaper did not come to us for a response to the first story - and in the second story , did not run our denial of the first one .
That was poor journalism . ""
He said the palace , from now on , would take a firm stance against inaccurate stories , in particular those relating to princes William and Harry .
He said : "" We are keen to put the record straight when newspapers get it wrong .
While we are not going to pick up on every mistake in every story , when a serious , misleading and damaging allegation has been made , we will seek to put it right .
It would be wrong to say that we are going to be taking a more aggressive approach , but we are certainly going to take a more determined line against inaccurate journalism . ""
Since he took over in February , there have been indications that the palace has decided to take a harder line against tabloid excesses .
In April he banned the Sun from taking official pictures of Prince William after it broke the informal agreement between the palace and the media by publishing pictures of the prince on the Swiss ski slopes with a girlfriend .
He has also complained about a recent story printed by the Evening Standard in London , headlined Wills Joins Diana Probe , which implied that the prince was going to give evidence to the Scotland Yard investigation into his mother 's death .
In fact , he has not approached the investigating team , nor has he received an approach ."

2004-06-16,"How to make a TV programme about Prince William 's love life ...
Ingredients One handsome young prince .
( If unavailable , a William lookalike will do . )
A bunch of choice fillies called Annabel or Arabella who have been out with / snogged / danced at China White with the handsome young prince .
( If out of season , pick various random girls who have never met him but quite like the look of him . )
A handful of close friends and family members , carefully selected and including the father and grandmother of the handsome young prince .
( If they turn out to be reluctant to take part in a Channel Five documentary , get a bunch of talking heads who are only too pleased to get on the telly .
You know , the usual - tabloid journalists , paparazzi , the deputy editor of Heat magazine . )
Archive shots of the prince skiing at Klosters or talking to common people on the other side of a crowd - control barrier to taste .
Method Place handsome young prince on a chair ( throne if you have one ) and do remarkably candid and revealing interview with him .
Find out who he 's going out with , if he plans to marry her , if not who he will marry , what he 's looking for in a potential wife , whether he 's learned any lessons from his parents ' relationship , whether he 's gay at all , when he first did it , if he follows his father 's example and insists on his lovers calling him "" sir "" , if he ever uses his father 's tampon chat - up line , that sort of thing .
Next , prepare Sloaney girls called Annabel or Arabella who have been linked with the prince .
Ask them interesting questions .
Do they plan to be queen ?
Could they cope with all the baggage ?
What is William like in bed ?
Do they really enjoy trudging around damp Scottish hills wearing rubbish clothes and murdering innocent creatures , or standing by freezing rivers for days on end just on the off - chance of landing the prince ?
Speak to the prince 's father and grandmother about their hopes , expectations and disappointments .
Mix the whole lot together , then blend it all artfully and elegantly .
Garnish with Klosters archive shots .
Alternative method ( if you find yourself lacking a few vital ingredients ) :
First , give random girls who have never met him a cut - out head of Prince William and ask them if he 's fit .
Next , show Prince William lookalike in situations the real prince may find himself in , sometimes with sloaney girl lookalikes - dancing , snogging , quadbiking , fishing , playing with his labrador , drinking bucks fizz in bed wearing his union flag boxer shorts .
( Tip : best keep it dark , distant or shot from behind as William lookalike is really only William lookabitlike ) .
Take William lookabitlike to nightclub
that is n't Chinawhite , probably because Chinawhite will have nothing to do with this project , to see what kind of reaction he gets .
Speak to glamour model Cassie , who does n't know William at all , but once met his younger brother at a nightclub .
Interview pundits and get them to say obvious things .
Lots of girls would n't mind ending up with William .
It 's very difficult for him and for girls because of the public interest , the press , and the fact that he 's always got a couple of men in dark suits following him around : Britney , Beyoncé and Baby Spice are unlikely to end up as queen of England .
Demonstrate that , actually , none of these people actually knows a thing about what 's going on in William 's life .
It 's all pure speculation .
And that 's it .
Congratulations - you 've made a lot of hot air ; a rumour souffle .
Garnish with those archive shots , and serve shamelessly .
Guess which method William 's Women ( Five ) used ?
Not that the first would have been possible of course , but that 's still no excuse .
I was disappointed that When Daddy Became Mummy ( BBC2 ) was about how one man got on alone with his four kids for a week .
Not that it was n't interesting , it was .
I just thought it was going to be the story of a sex change ."
2004-06-16,"Bob Dylan is to be awarded an honorary degree by St Andrews , Scotland 's oldest university .
Today 's announcement that the legendary king of folk rock , who once sang : "" You 've been with the professors , and they 've all liked your looks "" , is coming to the small Fife seaside town to collect his scroll next week will eclipse the presence of mere British royalty at the university .
Will it boost student applications as much as when Prince William arrived three years ago ?
Only purists will object that a man who still ca n't play the harmonica after 40 years should be made a doctor of music - his compositions are treated respectfully by academic critics , including Neil Corcoran , professor of English literature at St Andrews who has edited a collection of essays on Dylan ,
Do You Mr Jones ?
He will give the "" laureation address "" in praise of Dylan at the ceremony .
The new Oxford professor of poetry , Christopher Ricks , published Dylan 's Vision of Sin last year .
Dylan has only ever accepted one other honorary degree - from Princeton University in 1970 - and whether accepting one from such a conservative institution will provoke the same horror among his possessive fans as selling out to do lingerie ads , remains to be seen .
Announcing the honour , the university 's principal , Dr Brian Lang , said : "" Bob Dylan is an iconic figure for the 20th century , particularly for those of us whose formative years were the 1960s and 70s .
His songs , and in particular his lyrics , are still part of our consciousness .
We are very pleased to take this opportunity of honouring such a major artist . ""
Best known for hits such as Like a Rolling Stone , Mr Tambourine Man , Subterranean Homesick Blues and The Times
They are a Changin , Dylan fused rock , country , folk and blues in a unique sound .
His political lyrical content made him a poetic spokesman for the sixties generation .
He remains as much an influence among current rock musicians as he was to the Beatles and the Rolling Stones 40 years ago .
Dylan is currently on tour in Europe and after receiving his honorary degree will play the first of two nights in Glasgow .
He is not expected to sing at the graduation ceremony - though there will be no lack of suitable requests .
How about the ballad of Donald White ?
"" If I had some education To give me a decent start , I might have been a doctor or A master in the arts .
But I used my hands for stealing When I was very young , And they locked me down in jailhouse cells , That 's how my life begun . """
2004-08-08,"If it 's good enough for the royals , it 's good enough for us , so Prince William 's break on the tiny Mauritian island of Rodrigues is bound to spark a spate of copy - cat holidays .
William and seven mates - including girlfriend Kate Middleton - are staying at the Indian Ocean island for three weeks .
The prince first visited during his gap year in 2000 when he worked for the Royal Geographical Society on a conservation project . '
His last trip gave tourism there a shot in the arm and I 'm quite sure this will too , ' said Roger Diski , manager of Rainbow Tours . '
It 's a pity not more people know about the island as it really is a gem of a place . '
Rodrigues is a volcanic island surrounded by a coral reef and shallow lagoon renowned for its scuba diving opportunities ( which is what the prince spent most of his time doing ) .
He also hired a motorbike to ride along the 80 km of coastline , past deserted beaches and forests , sole home of the rare golden bat . '
It 's a paradise for divers , ' said a spokeswoman from the Mauritius Tourism Board . '
It 's like the rest of Mauritius was 30 years ago .
Not many British people go , which is probably why William does . '
So how can you follow in those blue - blooded footsteps ?
The best time to go is between November and April : temperatures are 25- 30C and the diving is superb .
Flights with Air Mauritius ( 020 7437 7075 ) from Heathrow to Rodrigues via Mauritius cost from £ 554pp return in November .
William has stayed at the remote Domaine De Decide ( 00 230 262 6708 ) , a pretty creole villa with a maid and a chef that lies in the heart of a huge park just a few minutes from the beach .
Five nights cost from £ 504-£806pp .
This time he is rumoured to be staying in a guest house for £ 25 a night , but you could stay in the luxurious Cotton Bay Hotel , half - board , from £ 1,195pp per week , including island transfers and flights from Heathrow , with Rainbow Tours
( 020 7226 1004 ) .
For more information , contact the Mauritius Tourism Board ( 020 7584 3666 ) ."
2004-08-15,"Now that a gap year has become as common as a 10-grand debt in student life , the backlash has begun .
Simple middle - class dossing , moaned a Guardian column last week ; there 's no benefit to communities , according to researchers .
It 's all a grave shock to those of us who thought Prince William really was saving the planet by scrubbing out a toilet in Chile on his gap year .
Like Santa or the tooth fairy , some things are just nice to believe in .
Somehow we 've convinced ourselves that travelling looks good on the CV .
Why ?
I suspect it 's just a benign conspiracy whereby overloaded universities try to defer applicants for as long as possible , airlines flog round - the - world tickets , and students keep a straight face while telling all and sundry that six months on Bondi beach really will make them a better person in the end .
Pre -
university gap years have always been a licence for students to take an extended holiday .
After graduation , it 's called unemployment , and is distinctly less appealing .
Gap years are a chance to learn that it 's far sunnier abroad , and to pick up a few life skills such as skinning up , getting the lid off a beer bottle without an opener , and disguising a public - school accent .
It may well be that most who go off to have meaningful experiences in Africa will still end up with the social awareness of Princess Michael of Kent .
Perhaps , indeed , much of the Third World lives in fear of a horsey 18-year - old turning up in their village to help out .
So , yes , it 's a fair cop : the CV thing was always a cover - up .
The growing numbers of grandparents bungee - jumping in Asia presumably are n't doing it to swing work experience at Goldman Sachs , and neither , in truth , are the kids .
But before we blow the whole thing for everyone , remember that it 's not just spoiled students who benefit .
There are more than a few jaded careerists out there who might like to have an extended holiday - sorry , gap year - sanctioned with the aura of social respectability .
You and I know that we wo n't necessarily make the world a better place , or come back a more rounded individual , or even a more enthusiastic employee .
But , please , do n't let the Grinches steal our gap years .

2004-08-15,"Scarlett Johansson has been hanging out with London 's smart set .
During filming of Woody Allen 's ' summer project ' , she has been partying with Lord Frederick Windsor and society girls Camilla Rutherford and Arabella Musgrave
( Prince William 's ex ) .
Worried she might be lonely , society fixers ( including Camilla Parker Bowles 's nephew Ben Elliot ) have arranged the equivalent of a 19th - century grand tour .
Meanwhile , over on Channel 4 , a middle - aged toff effs and blinds his way around his shabby country estate , grubbing for spare coins .
Which is the true face of 21st - century aristocracy ?
My money is on buffoon Francis Fulford , star of the C4 Cutting Edge documentary , The F***ing Fulfords , who turned out to be hilariously incompetent , racist , homophobic ... and broke .
Hence the presence of the TV cameras .
Increasingly , we are treated to asset - rich , cash - poor types on our screens .
Over on BBC2 there 's Country House , where the grand ancestral seat of the Earl of Normanton is strapped for cash .
Regency Country House Party was stuffed to the gills with young posh types looking for jobs in the media .
And coming up is C4 's terrifying new reality format , Too Posh to Wash , fronted by Kim Woodburn and Aggie MacKenzie of
How Clean Is Your House ? , which offers the low - down on the filthy rich .
In episode one , aristocrat Osla Henniker - Major , reveals that her personal hygiene is so poor she has earned the nickname ' The Ming ' .
Henniker - Major admits her dirty habits started at boarding school , Barnard Castle .
Her crimes against laundry include wearing the same bra for two years without washing it , not changing her bedsheets this year and wearing her knickers inside out to get double the wear .
It 's humiliation TV .
But what makes them do it ?
I know the Aubusson rug has to be mended and the wolfhounds fed .
But , dear God , are the aristocracy so strapped for cash they 'll sell their dignity on TV ?
Or do they secretly crave our love and understanding ?
Because our attitude to posh has changed immeasurably .
Once upon a time we spent our lives with our nose pressed against the window pane .
These were our elders and betters living a life we could never dream of .
Fed a diet of retro telly -
Brideshead Revisited , Edward VII , Poirot , To the Manor Born - and those God - awful public school documentaries about Radleigh and Westminster
, it never occurred to question the social order .
We curtsied , doffed our hats , lined up patiently in the rain for a fleeting glimpse of royalty .
Not any more .
In the words of historian Anthony Sampson : ' The dukes and earls have been sent packing from the House of Lords .
The royals are presented as a soap opera about dysfunctional divorcees , and the garden of Buckingham Palace is a venue for pop groups . '
And now , thanks to programme makers such as RDF and Endemol , toff TV is a form of Elizabethan bear baiting .
We want to watch the Trust Fund babes run a marathon ( The Games ) or find out exactly what the queen eats for tea ( plain , simple dishes , strong tea and biscuits , according to BBC1 's The Queen 's Cooks ) .
But actually the toffs themselves do have a sporting chance .
They may start out as an easy figure of fun , but if they prove to be game , funny , resourceful as castaways or in the jungle - Ben Fogle , Tara P - T , Jennie Bond , we salute you - we take them to our hearts .
We 're suckers for humility and authenticity ( just look at our love affair with Big Brother 's Nadia ) .
The only thing we ca n't stand are posh harpies : reality TV show The Dinner Party Inspectors was a failure because Victoria Mather and Meredith Etherington Smith sat around knocking back champagne , without bothering to help the contestants .
After all , these days the most interesting blue bloods have a day job .
Role models include the Dutch royal family , Princess Anne , the Duchess of Kent , who gave up her royal status to teach music to working - class kids .
Even the Queen charms with her parsimonious habit of keeping cereal in Tupperware containers .
And whenever I see Jemima Khan I go mute with love .
Not only is she studying for an MA in international affairs at the School of Oriental and African Studies ( as well as helping to found a charity to help Palestinian children ) , she 's also dating Hugh Grant .
What I ca n't bear is the social hypocrisy of the lazy nouveau aristo .
And what about the double standard ?
It 's considered common for a lower - middle class girl to get a tattoo , but when I open the latest issue of style bible , Tatler , I 'm reliably informed posh girls are queuing up to go under the needle .
Emma Parker Bowles has a cat on her bum apparently , while Clemmie Hambro has a frog .
And do n't get me started on sex .
If Essex girls drink and shag too much , they are foul - mouthed ladettes .
Posh girls are merely being sexually adventurous .
Tatler says stripping is now part of the upper - class education . '
Gone are lemon twinsets , flower arranging and the ability to back elegantly into a Jag ... striptease , talking dirty , sexy text - messaging , these are the new social arts ' .
No wonder the The F***ing Fulfords drew acres of analysis .
The tabloids dubbed the family the new Osbournes , while genteel types worried that the Fulfords had been stitched up .
AN Wilson chided us for ' predictable class hatred ' , praising the heroism of Francis Fulford for not wanting to sell off his land to new money .
Jilly Cooper complained he had been the victim of Channel 4 's ' egalitarian spite ' .
Egalitarian spite ?
What an oxymoron .
I realise I 've been suffering from it all my life .
It 's not that I distrust posh people .
I just do n't understand why a simple accident of birth makes them think they are better than us ( if you need any reminder of the dangers of social streaming , tune in to Channel 4 's
That 'll Teach ' Em this Tuesday , where pupils are sent back in time to that classic sink school , the 1960s secondary modern ) .
Forget pandering to textbook aristo eccentricity , I just want a level playing field : the same opportunities to make fool of ourselves , be loved and move up the ladder .
And I never thought I 'd say it , but reality TV is the new republicanism ."
2004-08-23,"Sections of the defence ministry , and many Britons , would oppose the idea of Prince William joining the military , says a US intelligence report obtained by the Guardian .
The prince has declared he would "" wholeheartedly "" enjoy a career in the armed forces , the traditional choice of work for the royals .
But the US Defence Intelligence Agency reported that many members of the British public believe he should follow his mother , Princess Diana , and "" devote his life to kinder and gentler humanitarian causes "" .
The American intelligence officials also warned that some in the British military were worried it would cause too much trouble to have the second in line to the throne serving in the armed forces .
The previously classified report said : "" The Ministry of Defence , particularly the army , have mixed feelings about having the future king of England in their ranks .
The army is all too familiar with the inexorable public scrutiny which goes hand - in - hand with such a situation .
The potential for a cause celebre is certain . ""
Military chiefs would have to keep the prince out of immediate danger , while avoiding accusations he was being pampered or treated differently from his colleagues .
But others in the MoD would be in favour , says the report .
"" On the other hand , should William 's experience be positive , many feel that the army will prosper in various areas , particularly recruiting , which all services are struggling with . ""
The intelligence officials also reported on the views of the British public on what they call the prince 's "" penchant for military service "" .
"" There are many members of the public who are less enamoured with William 's obvious martial interests .
They feel , in the light of Buckingham Palace 's deliberate attempt to modernise the monarchy and ingratiate itself more with the public after the death of Princess Diana , the future king of England should follow a different path .
They believe William should follow in his mother 's footsteps and devote his life to kinder and gentler humanitarian causes .
"" Princess Diana was well - known for championing charitable causes .
Her other son , Prince Harry , has already chosen a military career .
There has been speculation that Prince William was wary of joining up after he leaves St Andrews University next year .
But in May , he gave the clearest sign he would choose the military when he said : "" A career in the armed services would be the best thing at the moment because it would be lovely to recognise all the hard work that the armed forces are doing .
I would do it wholeheartedly and enjoy doing it . ""
The intelligence report , written in 1999 after a tabloid claimed he was contemplating joining the Parachute Regiment , observed "" military service has long been regarded as a requisite for the males within the royal family "" .
If Prince William , 22 , did go into the military , he would be following his father , uncles and grandfather .

2004-09-12,"Prince William is set to be deployed as a last - minute secret weapon to help London clinch the 2012 Olympics .
Leaders of the capital 's bid and senior royal officials have held talks about the 22-year - old prince being unveiled as a high - profile ambassador on London 's behalf shortly before the five - city contest is decided next year .
Discussions have centred on the prince accompanying the rest of London 's bid team when they go to Singapore in July to make their final presentation to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
Bid officials believe his presence and international appeal could help persuade IOC members to vote for London rather than Paris , Madrid , New York or Moscow .
The prince is a keen supporter of the bid and attended a Buckingham Palace reception for the 2012 campaign team in June , where he met British sporting legends such as Lord Coe , who is leading London 's bid , and Sir Steve Redgrave . '
He 's young , fresh , glamorous , loves sport and could be a very useful asset because the IOC love it when powerful people like royals and heads of state go out of their way to impress them , ' said one bid source . '
He could "" work "" for us , especially at the crunch time of the bidding process next July , because he 's a perfect example of what the IOC wants the Olympics to be : young , sporty and exciting . '
Coe has spoken to senior advisors at Clarence House about Prince William becoming involved and made clear that the royal 's participation could help swing the 6 July vote London 's way .
Bid leaders believe he will join figures such as Cherie Blair and double Athens gold medal winner Kelly Holmes as a bid ambassador , but not until nearer the time of next summer 's crucial IOC vote , when the exact details of his role will be confirmed .
Clarence House is studying Coe 's proposal carefully .
It has indicated that Prince William could have a role , but only if it did not interfere with his other commitments , especially his final year at St Andrews University .
However , the prince 's course finishes next June , so he would be available to help bid leaders mount a last - minute charm offensive to woo the 123 IOC members who will choose the 2012 host city .
Princess Anne , William 's aunt , is one of the 123 but can not vote for London : IOC members from bidding countries are banned from casting a vote until their own nation is out .
A spokesman at Clarence House said the idea had been proposed but nothing agreed . '
No decision has been made about Prince William 's involvement with the London Olympic bid , ' the spokesman said . '
He will take on no official roles until he completes his education at St Andrews University next summer . '
In May the IOC ranked London third in the running behind Paris and Madrid , but observers believe the capital has regained momentum since then .
Coe will this week address the Cabinet on the progress of London 's bid ."
2004-09-13,"Prince Harry was captured in fits of laughter today , alongside the Prince of Wales and Prince William , in a photograph released to mark his 20th birthday on Wednesday .
The black and white image of the first , second and third in line to the throne was shot by the leading fashion photographer Mario Testino .
While Harry is leaning forward laughing with his head down , Charles and 22-year - old William are facing the camera and smiling broadly .
The three are all wearing matching open necked white shirts and
a relaxed Charles sits between his two sons with his arms casually over their shoulders .
The Wales family photoshoot took place in July at Charles 's country home , Highgrove , in Gloucestershire .
Testino was taking pictures for their 2004 Christmas card but it was decided to release this out - take for Harry 's birthday .
A Clarence House spokesman said : "" This is the most recent picture of him relaxing at home with his father and brother . ""
Testino became a household name following his portraits of Diana , Princess of Wales , and has worked with her sons and Charles a number of times .
He is said to have sparked Harry 's giggles .
But the Peruvian - born photographer said : "" The truth is that they were not laughing at anything in particular .
It is just the way they relate to each other .
They seem to have a uniquely close father - son relationship . ""
Testino said he felt privileged to briefly be part of the princes ' "" private world "" and said there was an intimacy between them that is rarely seen by the public .
He previously took the official pictures for Harry 's 18th birthday , William 's 21st and last year 's Christmas card , which showed the princes in a treehouse in the grounds of Highgrove . ""
One thing that has caught my attention since the first time I photographed them is that there exists an intimacy between them that we rarely see , "" he said .
"" I feel very privileged to have the chance to briefly be part of their private world that I am very aware not many of us get to see . ""
Despite having worked with some of the world 's most famous celebrities , Testino admitted being nervous during royal photocalls . ""
Although I do still find it nerve racking to go and photograph them , at the same time it is a real treat , "" he said .
Testino also took pictures of Charles for Vogue magazine in 2002 .
During his 1997 photo session with Diana for Vanity Fair shortly before her death , Testino is reported to have made her laugh by doing a silly dance .
In the new image , which is not an official photograph , the princes are shown outside Highgrove 's Cotswold stone Orchard Room , which is used for meetings and seminars ."
2004-10-31,"Princess Alice , the Duchess of Gloucester and the oldest British royal in history , has died in her sleep at the age of 102 .
Known as the ' forgotten royal ' , because her last years were spent in seclusion , the princess , who was the Queen 's aunt , cut a tragic figure towards the end of her life .
Her elder son , Prince William , was killed in a plane crash in 1972 and her husband , Prince Henry , died two years later .
In 1995 , ill health forced the princess , born Lady Alice Christabel Montagu Douglas Scott , to leave her country residence , Barnwell Manor in Northamptonshire , and move into Kensington Palace , home to her son , Prince Richard , who had become Duke of Gloucester .
The move was said to have upset the princess , as she was devoted to Barnwell , where she had lived since 1938 .
In her final years , royal aides said the Princess was unable to recognise her closest family .
In July 2000 the Duke of Gloucester issued a statement saying his mother was frail but ' in good spirits ' .
In her earlier years , the princess was a keen skier and water - colourist , and had lived in Kenya and India .
Once she paid an illegal visit to Afghanistan , disguised in an Afghan coat and cap .
During the Second World War she worked with the Red Cross and the Order of St John .
Yesterday a Buckingham Palace spokesman said the Queen had been greatly saddened to learn of her aunt 's death . '
The Queen remembers with gratitude Princess Alice 's service to the monarchy and to the country , ' the spokesman said ."
2004-11-20,"Prince William would like to follow his younger brother , Harry , into the army when he graduates from the University of St Andrews next summer .
The prince , who is second in line to the throne , told the Press Association news agency and a BBC television crew - recording his first broadcast interview - that he would do so if he was allowed to share the hardships of the troops under his command . ""
Definitely I would like to go to Sandhurst ...
But the last thing I want to do is be mollycoddled or wrapped up in cotton wool , because if I was to join the army I 'd want to go where my men went
and I 'd want to do what they did .
"" I would not want to be kept back for being precious or whatever , that 's the last thing I 'd want .
It 's the most humiliating thing and it would be something I 'd find very awk ward to live with , being told I could n't go out there when these guys have got to go out there and do a bad job . ""
The prince 's concern echoes that of his great - great uncle , Edward VIII , who chafed at not being allowed to serve in the trenches on the western front during the first world war .
While heirs to the throne have traditionally undergone at least some military training - William 's father , Prince Charles , served in the Royal Navy - they have been protected from war zone service , unlike their siblings .
William , 22 , made clear that he had thought carefully about the current military engagement in Iraq when making the decision to attend last weekend 's Cenotaph Remembrance Day service in London , which he watched from the Foreign Office balcony .
He said : "" I just thought , what with the Iraq war and troops being abroad and particularly the Black Watch going through a very tough time , I thought it was just the right time for me probably to make an entrance and be there for the youth and make a point that the young still have n't forgotten and still very much appreciate what 's been done for everyone . ""
The army is obviously a lot more in the spotlight at the moment ...
The remembrance service really does bring it home when you 're there
and there 's actually a war going on somewhere at the time and the guys are fighting their hearts out .
"" Prince Harry starts at the Sandhurst military academy in January , having already been put on notice that rowdy behaviour will not be tolerated .
William , who is generally thought to be the quieter , more sensitive of the two and who has not previously manifested an interest in military service or any other career , joked that he had put his brother in first as a guinea pig .
The interview , arranged and conducted before his father 's latest outburst on education 's alleged shortcomings , showed the prince to be leading a life like many other students : shopping at Tesco , getting takeaways and hiring videos , playing pool in the local bar , reluctant to do the washing - up in his student digs and undergoing an essay crisis in the run - up to his geography finals next year .
In his case the crisis involves a 10,000-word dissertation on the coral reefs of Rodrigues island in the Indian Ocean - handily chosen because that is where he went on holiday in the summer - of which , with a fortnight to go to the deadline , 8,500 words remain to be written .
Few students , however , are asked for their autograph in the street or propositioned with a view to marriage ( "" very sweet of her to ask me , but I had to decline , sadly "" ) .
The prince has also , apparently , been asked the best place to buy underwear by an elderly woman who stopped him in the street and did not recognise him .
William said he was confident of obtaining a 2:1 .
His tutor , Dr Charles Warren , said : "" From my perspective he 's done a fantastic job of fitting in and pulling his weight and living an ordinary student life .
He 's one of the crowd . """
2004-11-21,"This weekend should have been a celebration for the royal family .
The Queen , the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles were looking forward to a warm reaction to Prince William 's first television interview .
The BBC programme , screened on Friday to mark the beginning of William 's final year of studies at St Andrews University , revealed a relaxed modern royal .
It was n't quite like that of course .
Newspaper headlines all week had painted a different picture .
The Independent condemned Prince Charles for ' slagging off all our children ' .
The Express said he was ' Edwardian ' .
Even the former BBC royal correspondent , Jennie Bond , said Charles regarded himself as ' God ' .
Aides to the prince said yesterday he was ' raging ' that press criticism of his traditional views on education and social change had taken the gloss off his son 's thoroughly modern performance . '
He 's been shouting at the radio again this morning , ' one royal insider revealed .
It had been a pretty bad week for the royals .
For the first time , senior government ministers have broken ranks and publicly criticised the heir to the throne .
When a leaked memo revealed that Charles condemned people for thinking ' they are qualified to do things far beyond their technical capabilities ' , Charles Clarke , the Education Secretary , dismissed the prince as ' old - fashioned , patronising and out of time ' . '
We ca n't all be born to be king but we can all aspire for ourselves and for our families to do the very best , ' he said .
John Reid , the Health Secretary , and Peter Hain , the Welsh Secretary , said the prince 's ' know your place ' views were ' wrong ' .
Even the staunchly royalist press weighed in . '
Charles is just feudal and blissfully unaware of it , ' sniffed the Daily Mail .
Other papers said his ' be happy with your lot ' attitude smacked of ' arrogant elitism and the long - dead age of rigid class division and forelock tugging deference ' .
Royal observers are shocked .
Mark Bolland , former deputy private secretary to the prince , who now runs his own public relations agency , said : ' Ministers have always criticised the heir to the throne and other senior royals but there was always a tacit understanding that any criticism would be in private .
That line has been crossed . '
For a man who thought he had shaken off his image as a cranky dilettante who talked to his plants to become a serious player on the political landscape , lauded for his views on GM foods , environmental protection , local business and religious tolerance , the latest row is a PR disaster .
How did it all go wrong for Charles ?
Some point to changes in the royal household that have left Charles surrounded by a coterie of traditional , right - wing thinkers and aides who bolster , rather than challenge , his conservative instincts .
Only 18 months ago Charles 's key staff were family man Stephen Lamport as private secretary , comprehensive - educated gay man Bolland , and black mother - of - two Colleen Harris as press secretary .
The three steered him away from subjects where his views did not chime with the public - notably foxhunting and farming - in favour of those that did , in particular his Prince 's Trust charity work .
One Buckingham Palace source explained : ' Charles is at heart a very conservative and pompous chap .
He fears the progressive society because he knows it holds the monarchy in contempt .
He needs people around him to keep him in touch with the outside world .
Stephen , Mark and Colleen said "" No "" to his sillier thoughts and he listened . '
But all three moved on to new jobs to be replaced by a more conservative grouping , led by Sir Michael Peat , Charles 's new private secretary . '
There are n't any working - class kids around any more , ' says one former Clarence House aide .
Chris Woodhead , former head of Ofsted , is a frequent visitor to Clarence House and Highgrove , another is right - wing newspaper columnist Melanie Phillips .
The prince has also had a series of meetings with David Lorimer , a former Winchester College teacher , who heads an intellectual group called the Scientific and Medical Network and whose publications include Survival ?
Body , Mind and Death in the Light of Psychic Experience and Thinking Beyond the Brain .
Lorimer has been linked to Charles 's thinking revealed in the memo which said : ' Social utopianism , which believes humanity can be genetically and socially re - engineered , contradicts the lessons of history . '
Some observers argue that staff changes at Clarence House are solely to blame for Charles 's increasingly traditional views . '
It beggars belief that the heir to the throne - who lives a pampered life and who got into Cambridge with poor A - levels - thinks he can pontificate about education and question ordinary people 's natural ambition to better themselves without offending just about everyone in this country , ' says one former adviser . '
But I 'm afraid that 's just the kind of thing that happens if you spend too long listening to wacky practitioners , such as David Lorimer . '
Others paint a different - darker - picture .
They claim that the prince has simply given up trying to be popular .
He does n't have the stomach for yet another PR makeover and has reverted to his traditionalist roots .
His new band of advisers is not creating new views .
They are simply bolstering the unpopular opinions he has held for a long time .
Former palace aides point out that Charles has tried to reinvent himself as a popular modern monarch - in - waiting three times - only to fail on each occasion .
First , he granted a frank interview to Jonathan Dimbleby , in which , instead of casting himself as a good husband and modern father , he admitted adultery with Camilla Parker Bowles .
Next , under the media - savvy eye of Bolland , he sought to make Parker Bowles an accepted public figure , appearing with her at carefully choreographed public events .
Most recently , the prince has tried to present himself as a champion of traditional , rural values - but has blotted his copybook by his staunch support for foxhunting .
One former adviser said : ' He 's spent a decade trying all he can to be the nice , modern , thoughtful royal and it 's got him nowhere .
So , now he 's just said : "" Sod it .
I 'll be me .
I 'll retreat into my peculiar constituency and the public can take me or leave me "" . '
The aide points to two recent events as proof of the prince 's change of heart . '
When Charles wrote to the Prime Minister last year and defended farmers and hunters by likening their oppression to that of blacks and gays it was all over .
His staff begged him not to send the letter and he kept it in his drawer for three months but he still sent it . '
More recently , he went to the Ritz hotel in London to launch a campaign to help small farmers by persuading consumers to eat more mutton . '
Eat more old sheep ?
Mutton Week ?
At the Ritz ?
There 's no clearer sign that Charles is going his own way . '
The heir to the throne 's attempt to ' set the record straight ' about last week 's leaked memo in a speech to Anglican bishops at Lambeth Palace tomorrow is unlikely to end the row . '
His views are a muddle , ' said one supporter . '
By speaking up and effectively restating both views he will prolong the controversy . '
Others see bigger trouble ahead .
One former adviser said last night that , by reacting to ministers ' criticisms , Charles is starting a public debate he can not win . '
The heir to the throne has become Labour 's whipping boy . '
Aspiration for all - especially the ambitious lower middle classes - is expected to be a central message of Labour 's campaign .
What better way to make the point about opportunity for all if not by a little gentle baiting of Charles ?
As he puts the final touches to his speech tonight , Charles would do well to ponder the words of his own leaked memo . '
What 's wrong with everyone nowadays ?
What is it that makes everyone think ...
they can be pop stars , High Court judges , brilliant TV presenters or even infinitely more competent heads of state without ever putting in the necessary effort or having natural abilities . '
Charles 's sudden clash with Britain 's political class will test his ' natural abilities ' to the full ."
2004-11-27,"Prince William may be the most eligible man in Britain , but would he give me good - looking children ?
Unfortunately , the answer is no .
Those aristocratically fleshy noses , the lantern jaws - and do n't even get me started on those chins .
So , with apologies to the royal one , I must cross him off my list of prospective partners - well , it 's a harsh world out there and one has to take into account a variety of considerations when choosing a partner .
Conveniently , a computer program is now on hand to help us all do just that .
Predict Your Child , a program designed by two researchers at Stirling University , allows couples to see what their future offspring could look like .
It does cost a small fee - £ 25 - but how can one put a price on knowing you are not wasting your time with someone who would give you unattractive kids ?
The researchers , Charlie Frowd and Peter Hancock , were inspired to create the software by their work helping to identify criminals .
"" We had been working for some time with a very sophisticated photofit computer program in which we could mix features of different faces as directed by the victims in order to draw up a picture of the criminal , and we thought , why ca n't we do this cross - breeding with normal people ? "" said Dr Frowd .
Using a photograph of each of the future parents , the researchers give the program a set of "" genes "" , or parameters , that describe the faces .
The software then randomly mixes up the genes and produces an image of the result .
Accuracy , apparently , is not guaranteed . ""
Each time the computer produces a different result because the genes are mixed differently , as in reality , "" said Dr Frowd .
The researchers have not yet tested it on a couple who already have children to see how closely the computer 's predictions match the real thing .
And so far , no couples have decided to end their relationships when faced with unfortunate looking children , "" and I very much hope none do "" , Dr Frowd said .
Does this represent the apotheosis of a looks - obsessed culture ? ""
Oh no , it 's more of novelty , "" he said , before adding , contradictorily , "" it 's more of a fun wedding present , or a dating agency "" .
But let 's cut to the point : are there any tricks for producing pretty sprogs ?
"" I do n't think there are any guarantees,""Dr
Frowd said .
"" Each time you breed , the kids will look different .
Sometimes a child looks not very attractive , other times they look like a model . ""
So the trick is to have lots of children and hope that you hit the target eventually ? ""
Yes . ""
But this sounds too vague for me , not to mention exhausting .
The most common theory ( in the world of women 's magazines , anyway ) is that one should look for an alpha partner , and you surely ca n't get more alpha than the future ruler of the realm , Prince William .
Good at sport , well turned - out and the most eligible bachelor in all of Christendom - plus I would make my mum a very , very happy woman .
But unfortunately , even combined with my peasant genes , our children turn out too Sloane Rangerish for their mother 's comfort .
Dr Frowd agreed : "" They do have a kind of Windsor influence and I do n't think that family is very attractive , "" he said .
Perhaps I need to update my definition of "" alpha "" .
So what about a more modern kind of royalty , like the current king of British pop music , Pete Doherty , formerly of The Libertines ?
OK , he may have a pronounced substance abuse problem , having been thrown out of his band due to an addiction to heroin and crack ; and , admittedly , my mother would be less thrilled .
But the NME has just this week anointed him "" Cool Icon of 2004 "" - and you ca n't get more alpha than that .
So I push Wills away and breed with Pete and , predictably , I produce beautiful children with this "" punk soap opera spiked with criminality , heroin and homoeroticism "" , to use a recent magazine description .
In fact , I become so filled with parental pride for the Freeman - Doherty hypothetical offspring I briefly consider whether it would be for the world 's greater good to make this dream a reality .
I wonder where "" punk soap operas "" hang out these days .
Sorry mum , but you just ca n't fight genetics ."
2004-12-09,"The rule of male primogeniture , by which the eldest son of a monarch becomes king even if he has an elder sister , will end if a bill published today is passed .
The succession to the crown bill , sponsored by the Labour peer and former minister Lord Dubs , would allow Prince William 's eldest child to succeed him regardless of gender . ""
Anachronistic rules of succession risk preventing the monarchy being acceptable to a full range of 21st - century British society , "" Lord Dubs warns .
"" Support for changes that would reflect modern Britain 's values on gender and religious discrimination would be all but universal .
"" The bill also seeks to remove the ban on a monarch marrying a Roman Catholic by excising from the Union with Scotland and Union with England acts of 1706 and 1707 the objection to "" persons marrying papists "" .
Finally , it would abolish the Royal Marriages Act of 1772 , which requires that descendants of George II - except princesses marrying into a foreign family - obtain the monarch 's consent in order for their marriages to be valid .
On male primogeniture , Lord Dubs says : "" The idea that a female first - born heir should be passed over in favour of a younger brother is surely offensive to the vast majority of Britons , given the great social revolution that has occurred in the position of women over the three decades since the Sex Discrimination Act was passed in 1975 .
"" Supporters of the monarchy constantly pay tribute to the great dedication of the Queen over her 50-year reign , and it is surely better to make this change at a time when the princes , William and Harry , are first and second in line to the throne rather than wait until the moment when it would change the line of succession . ""
Lord Dubs describes the ban on a monarch marrying a Catholic as "" an outdated piece of religious bigotry ...
Prince William could live with a Catholic girlfriend without forfeiting the right to be king , but the moment they were married he would be instantly disqualified , "" he says .
He calls the 1772 act "" the Dangerous Dogs Act of its day "" , saying it was "" passed in haste owing to George III 's chagrin that his relatives were getting married without consulting him "" .
But Lord Dubs warns that some traditional monarchists "" treat the institution like a Ming vase and are afraid to disturb it at all for fear of destroying it , while some convinced republicans fear that reform would prevent the monarchy rotting to a slow death "" .
As a member of the Fabian Society Executive , Lord Dubs contributed to the society 's Monarchy Commission report .
The palace had welcomed the document as "" a useful contribution to the debate "" , he said .
The last attempt to remove male primogeniture came in a 1998 bill sponsored by Lord Archer .
At that time , the government said it did not oppose equality but wanted to bring in its own legislation .
The bill was withdrawn , but no legislation has since been introduced .
Downing Street today declined to comment on the latest bill , which received its formal first reading in the House of Lords yesterday and is due for its second reading on January 14 ."

2005-04-10,"Opposition to Prince Charles becoming the next monarch has increased sharply , a MORI/ Observer poll reveals today .
Despite the celebrations surrounding yesterday 's wedding , more than four in 10 Britons ( 42 per cent ) believe Charles should give up the right to be the next king in favour of his eldest son , Prince William .
This is up from 34 per cent in a similar survey four years ago .
The telephone poll of 1,004 adults , conducted over the past three days , including the day of the wedding , found little change in support for Britain becoming a republic over the past 36 years - 22 per cent compared with 18 per cent in 1969 .
The royal wedding has failed to make any impact on the public 's resistance to Camilla becoming queen in the event of Charles taking the throne , with 63 per cent saying last week she should not do so , compared with 62 per cent in May 2002 .

Despite the celebrations surrounding yesterday 's wedding , more than four in 10 Britons ( 42 per cent ) believe Charles should give up the right to be the next king in favour of his eldest son , Prince William .
This is up from 34 per cent in a similar survey four years ago .
The telephone poll of 1,004 adults , conducted over the past three days , including the day of the wedding , found little change in support for Britain becoming a republic over the past 36 years - 22 per cent compared with 18 per cent in 1969 .
The royal wedding has failed to make any impact on the public 's resistance to Camilla becoming queen in the event of Charles taking the throne , with 63 per cent saying last week she should not do so , compared with 62 per cent in May 2002 .
But , in a confirmation of support for the wedding , the poll found 64 per cent of the public believed the couple should marry - although 21 per cent said they neither knew nor cared whether it was a good idea ."
2005-04-14,"It may fall short of Prince William 's sartorial standards , but Arthur Edwards ' trusty green anorak has seen him through a dozen Klosters winters and countless royal appointments .
Now though the Sun 's royal photographer will have to find another way of keeping warm after his favourite coat was auctioned off on eBay .
The veteran snapper agreed to put his coat up for sale for charity after Prince William took exception to it at the infamous Klosters clash with the press .
While his father took unkindly to that "" that awful man "" Nicholas Witchell , Prince William ribbed the man who has covered more royal deaths , births and marriages than anyone else on the beat .
""
Arthur , I see you 're still wearing that horrible green jacket , "" he quipped as he and his brothers sat through another photo session .
Today Edwards said the jacket just had to go .
"" We did it to raise some money for a children 's hospice .
I got a donation of £ 50 from a reader in Canada , so it 's going over there , "" said Edwards .
"" I quite liked it actually .
But it had to go .
""
Edwards , whose extra large apple - green coat has now been dispatched across the Atlantic , was today modelling a new black and white number from the company that made Prince William 's own skiing jacket . ""
The editor 's bought me a new one .
It 's a smart coat and I was quite grateful for it today for the photo call with Charles and Camilla - we had sleet and rain and everything , "" he said .
Edwards , 64 , has covered the royal beat for 28 years and was referred to by Diana , Princess of Wales as ' our Arthur ' .
Last year he was briefly banned by the palace after the Sun published pictures of Prince William on the slopes with his girlfriend , Kate Middleton , in defiance of an informal agreement to leave the royals alone during their skiing holiday .

2005-05-17,"Prince William will be combining business with pleasure when he undertakes his first solo royal tour , with official engagements , this summer .
He is to accompany the British and Irish Lions on their rugby tour of New Zealand at the start of July , shortly after his graduation , Clarence House announced yesterday .
The prince , who has played scrum - half in school rugby and is a devoted fan of the game , will accompany the team as a spectator and attend tests against the All Blacks .
But he will also represent the Queen in Wellington and Auckland at events to commemorate the anniversary of the end of the second world war .
Paddy Harverson , the prince 's spokesman , said : "" William is a big fan of rugby and is really looking forward to going to New Zealand .
He is also proud to be representing the Queen . ""
The invitation apparently came from Clive Woodward , the Lions ' coach , who said yesterday that his presence would be a "" great boost "" for the team .
A team spokeswoman said : "" William has indicated that he is absolutely delighted to be joining us and that he wants to get his hands dirty .
He could be involved in training , setting - up - all manner of things . ""

2005-05-25,"A close friend of Prince William and Prince Harry who is on trial over the storming of parliament by pro - hunt protesters was at the centre of confusion today over the reason given for his absence from court .
Luke Tomlinson , 28 , was due to turn out for a polo match this afternoon after being given leave by district judge Timothy Workman not to attend today at Bow Street magistrates ' court in London .
Yesterday his barrister , David Williams QC , requested permission for him to be absent , telling the court : "" He is a professional polo player .
This is a very important week for England and on Wednesday he is representing his country . ""
But the governing body of the sport , the Hurlingham Polo Association , confirmed today that there was no official England match until later this summer .
Mr Tomlinson is playing in a team called Geebung - in which he is the only Englishman listed - in a tournament at Windsor .
His solicitor Jeffrey Hide took the blame today for any misunderstanding , saying he had taken the view that his client was representing England because he is English
and he was playing against foreigners .
"" I know that [ Mr Tomlinson ] plays in polo matches and often these are against foreign people - when he plays polo he is representing England because he is English
and he is playing foreigners , "" Mr Hide said .
"" This is a very important match for him .
If there was a misunderstanding , that was between me and counsel . ""
Mr. Tomlinson , from Tetbury , Gloucestershire , gave evidence in the case yesterday and told the court he had thought "" trying to get into the House of Commons would be like trying to get out of Colditz "" .
He and his seven co - defendants , including Otis Ferry , 22 - the son of rock star Bryan - stormed into the House of Commons chamber on September 15 last year during a debate on a bill to ban foxhunting .
They are charged under the Public Order Act with "" disorderly behaviour "" that "" caused harassment , alarm or distress "" .
The others on trial Nicholas Wood , 41 , a chef from Laycock , Wiltshire , John Holliday , 42 , a huntsman from Ledbury , Herefordshire , Robert Thame , 36 , a polo player from Maidenhead , Berkshire , horse breeder David Redvers , 34 , from Hartbury , Gloucestershire , Andrew Elliott , 43 , an auctioneer from Ledbury , Herefordshire , and Richard Wakeham , 36 , a surveyor from York .
All eight men have pleaded not guilty .

2005-06-05,"The Awful End of Prince William the Silent by Lisa Jardine HarperCollins £ 12.99 , pp144 Some assassinations - one finger , one trigger - change the world forever : take Lee Harvey Oswald or the Wagnerian reverberations of Sarajevo in 1914 .
But where did it all begin ?
When did the first assassin , alone or part of a wider plot , deranged or clinically cool , shoot the first victim of renown and alter the course of history in a trice ?
Meet Balthasar Grard , 25 , a Catholic dogsbody from a village near the French town of Besan¿on who , in July 1584 , brought the news that the Duke of Anjou was dead to William of Orange
( he was called the Silent because he did n't say very much ) and shot him three times with a small , wheel - lock pistol , thus becoming the founder member of the Dishonourable Company of Mysterious Assassins .
What happened next ?
Good Queen Bess had been dithering for ages over whether William and his Orange revolution against Spain 's hegemony in the Low Countries just across the North Sea was worth supporting .
The Silent One had been holding his accumulation of mini - states and provinces together by force of Protestant personality .
He had survived one attempt to kill him .
But now he was gone and something had to be done .
England squared up to Philip II of Spain .
The Armada sailed - and the rest is triumphant English history .
Lisa Jardine is one of the editors as well as one of the authors of this ' Making History ' series , which aims to take great turning points and - pithily , wittily - distil them into 140 pages or so .
This , the first assassination of a head of state with a pistol , fits that bill almost perfectly .
Do you want to know why the Dutch football team wear orange ?
Or why the Ulster marchers perform their baffling rituals on cue ?
Or ( at least tangentially ) why the tangled forest that is the English monarchy swapped family trees ?
Or why everything , 500 years later , is different , but also much the same ?
Then this is an enthralling train ride of a book , light , swift and perfectly prepared .
Do n't expect Professor Jardine to get too bogged down by all of this .
The lessons are gently drawn here , the basic stance is ' Just fancy that ! '
Connections are made cautiously , almost diffidently .
The fundamental lesson - that wild men with guns and no security clearance can up - end all of us and our supposed certainties - is tragically obvious .
But this is still an engrossing , spritely read .
History can , indeed , be made in a bloody second , as Balthasar Grard proved .
The speculation over who and why and what it was all about is standard whenever a bullet flies .
And , in a way , with a sinking heart , you could indeed say that modern history began in July 1584 ."

The second in line to the throne will be able to access his final grade online from 9 am .
Britain 's most famous undergraduate said last year that he was on track to get an upper second class honours ( 2:1 ) in his geography MA , providing his dissertation and final exams went well .
His wrote his 10,000 word dissertation on the coral reefs of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean .
The prince , who celebrates his 23rd birthday later this month , had a somewhat rocky start to his life in the isolated Scottish town in Fife .
He struggled to adjust in his first term , but eventually settled down after switching his course from history of art to geography .
In the end , St Andrews became a haven , where the locals grew used to having a royal pin - up around town .
Tomorrow , the prince and hundreds of other students at the university will be able to access their degree classifications though a secure website .
From Monday , they will also receive a confirmation letter by post .
He will then become one of about 1,400 St Andrews students who graduate in the town at the end of June .
With his university experience at an end and military training beckoning , the prince is preparing to fly to New Zealand to join the British Lions squad on their rugby tour .
During his stay on the islands , he will also carry out his first solo engagements on behalf of the Queen to celebrate the end of the second world war - marking a new era of royal duties for him .
The prince , who plans to sign up for the army and attend Sandhurst like his younger brother Prince Harry , has spoken about being "" wary "" of developing his public role too soon .
His father the Prince of Wales got a lower second class honours ( 2:2 ) from Trinity College , Cambridge , for his history degree .
He also swapped courses , having initially picked archaeology and anthropology .

2005-06-12,"Prince William is now Britain 's brainiest royal .
He made history yesterday when he was awarded an upper second honours degree - an achievement that outstrips all his predecessors .
The 22-year - old 's father left Trinity College , Cambridge , with a lower second - class degree ( 2:2 ) in history and his uncle , the Earl of Wessex , gained a similar qualification in the same subject , from Jesus College , Cambridge .
No other members of the royal family have attended university .
William 's mother , Diana , Princess of Wales , left school with a CSE in domestic science while his brother , Prince Harry , opted for a military career at Sandhurst over academia .
Clarence House announced the Prince had gained a 2:1 in his geography MA from St Andrews University shortly after he attended yesterday 's Queen 's birthday parade .
At the ceremony , his stepmother , the Duchess of Cornwall , appeared on the famous Buckingham Palace balcony for the first time .
Camilla stood between her husband , the Prince of Wales , and William ; and alongside the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh as they watched an RAF fighter flypast spearheaded by two Typhoon Eurofighters .
William and his stepmother then travelled together in a carriage to the annual Trooping the Colour parade which saw some 1,220 troops take part in a display of precision formation marching and horsemanship choreographed to military band music .
VIPs attending included the Prime Minister , Tony Blair , and his wife , Cherie , as well as the Defence Secretary , John Reid .
Earlier in the day , William had been one of hundreds of St Andrews students who went online to check their results on a secure website .
A Clarence House spokesman said : ' William got an upper second class honours .
He 's delighted .
Everyone is absolutely delighted .
His father 's very proud . '
Owing to changes in data protection , university grades are no longer posted on notice boards for all to see .
William had hinted last year that he was hoping to get a 2:1 but said a lot depended on his 10,000-word dissertation on the coral reefs of Rodrigues .
With his university experience at an end and military training beckoning , William is preparing to fly to New Zealand , to watch the British Lions squad on their rugby tour .
During his stay on the islands , he will also carry out his first solo official engagements on behalf of the Queen , when he attends a ceremony marking the end of the Second World War ."
2005-06-23,"Prince William today described his "" normal "" life as a student after graduating from St Andrews University with a 2:1 in geography .
But while the prince may have been just another student at today 's graduation ceremony , he is now distinguished among the royal family as the only member ever to have received a masters degree .
The 23-year - old wore the traditional black gown and white bow tie as he knelt in front of the chancellor of St Andrews , Sir Kenneth Dover , to be "" capped "" in the historic proceedings while his father , stepmother and grandparents watched from the audience .
He was called on to stage by the name William Wales , which he has used throughout his university career .
Following the ceremony , he told reporters : "" Today is a very special day for me and I am delighted that I can share it with my family , and in particular with my grandmother , who has made such an effort to come , having been under the weather . ""
He added : "" I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at St Andrews
and I shall be very sad to leave .
"" I just want to say a big thank you to everyone who has made my time here so enjoyable .
I have been able to lead as normal a student life as I could have hoped for
and I 'm very grateful to everyone , particularly the locals , who have helped make this happen . ""
He told guests at a reception following the ceremony that he was now going out into the "" big wide world "" .
Clarence House confirmed he would be spending the summer doing work experience in the City of London and then with a mountain - rescue team .
He hopes to enlist in the army and has already passed his first round of tests to train at Sandhurst , as did his brother , Harry .
Prince William is believed to be only the third member of the royal family ever to have obtained a degree and the first to get a masters .
His father , the Prince of Wales , was the first , obtaining a second class degree in history , at Cambridge in 1970 .
His uncle , the Earl of Wessex , gained a similar qualification in the same subject , from Jesus College , Cambridge .
Like all Scottish universities , St Andrews offers four - year masters , as opposed to three - year undergraduate degrees in England and Wales .
During the ceremony , students filed one - by - one on to the stage when their names were called .
The prince was greeted by a burst of flash photography , loud applause and even one slight cheer - but not from the royal party , who simply smiled and clapped .
William knelt before the chancellor 's wooden pulpit , holding on to the horizontal metal bar at the front above the St Andrews crest .
The chancellor swiftly tapped the prince 's head , in keeping with custom , with a small 17th century scarlet cloth cap called Birretum , which is said to contain cloth from trousers worn by the religious reformer John Knox .
As William bowed his head , the chancellor declared in Latin : "" Et super te "" , meaning "" and upon you "" .
His girlfriend , Kate Middleton , a history of art student , graduated in the same ceremony .
The pair arrived together 20 minutes before the ceremony , with William pausing to wait with Ms Middleton as she worked out where she was sitting .
A spokeswoman for St Andrews said : "" We are delighted for all students who graduated today . """
2005-06-24,"Blinking a little in the bright Fife sun , clutching a decent degree , Prince William emerged from his graduation ceremony yesterday into a life much less ordinary .
From midnight tomorrow , after a graduation ball , the informal agreement that has allowed the future king to live as just another student at St Andrews University for four paparazzi - free years will end .
Clarence House has confirmed that no new arrangement is in place with the press to shelter the prince beyond a hope for respect and restraint . ""
He 's a young man .
There is a public interest in him , "" said Paddy Harveson , Prince Charles 's press secretary .
"" We hope the media show judgment in reporting his life . ""
As William joined his fellow graduates meeting proud relatives on the clipped grass of St Salvator 's Quadrangle after yesterday 's ceremony he told one guest : "" I 'm going out into the big wide world . ""
"" I think it should be an interesting time , hopefully not too horrendous , "" said Joe Little , managing editor of Majesty Magazine .
"" There is a sizeable price on his head from the tabloids to get pictures of him leading the life of a relatively normal 23-year - old . "" To be honest , the chap has been a little bit cocooned up to now - I think mollycoddled would be over - egging it .
He has been pretty well protected , unlike his brother .
His brother took quite a hammering a few months ago and survived that .
William is a very different character .
I think he will have a bit of a bumpy ride .
By the same token , he is a bright lad and he is very savvy .
He is his mother 's son . ""
Still considering a career in the army , the prince , who got a 2:1 degree , will this autumn do work experience with a financial company in the City , with a mountain rescue team and on a country estate , learning land management .
Next week , he heads to New Zealand to watch the touring British and Irish Lions rugby team .
He said he was looking forward to challenges and opportunities ahead , but was sorry to be leaving St Andrews and all that it had afforded him :
"" I just want to say a big thank you to everyone who has made my time here so enjoyable .
I have been able to lead as ' normal ' a student life as I could have hoped for and I am very grateful to everyone , particularly the locals , who has helped to make this happen . ""
Earlier , the Queen , one proud grandmother among many , arrived for the ceremony at the university 's Younger Hall with the Duke of Edinburgh , followed by a beaming Prince Charles and Camilla , Duchess of Rothesay .
They watched as William was called to the dais as William Wales to accept his master of arts ( honours ) degree in geography .
He knelt briefly before St Andrews ' chancellor , Sir Kenneth Dover , to be tapped on the head with a small 17th - century scarlet cloth cap said to contain a fragment from the religious reformer John Knox 's trousers .
As William bowed his head , the chancellor declared in Latin "" et super te "" , meaning "" and upon you "" .
The prince 's girlfriend , Kate Middleton graduated a few minutes before him .
They had arrived at the hall together but were seated apart .
During the ceremony , the principal and vice - chancellor , Brian Lang , told students that they may have met their future husband or wife during their time at the university . ""
Our title as the top matchmaking university in Britain signifies so much that is good about St Andrews , so we rely on you to go forth from St Andrews and multiply , "" he said .
The prince emerged to the massed ranks of the media .
He smiled , raising his hand .
Later , he spent 15 minutes talking to the large crowd who had gathered to see him as he made his way to the local police station to thank the officers who have watched over him .
Fife 's chief constable , Peter Wilson , said the job of looking after the prince had been fuss - free , largely because of William 's attitude and that of the local community .
"" I suspect he 'll miss it when he 's gone , "" said Mr Wilson .
"" The spotlight will be on him now .
"" It is a sentiment echoed by those who have lived in the town and have let William be . ""
He 's just been another student , "" said Rose Millett , 21 , a third - year English undergraduate .
"" You see him doing his shopping in Tesco or out in the pub .
People did n't make a fuss .
It has been like a little idyllic hideaway for him . ""
Jessie Young , 70 , turned out yesterday to see the royal graduate on his way .
"" I saw him joining the university and I wanted to see him leaving , "" she said .
"" He 's done well for the town . ""
He 's a nice lad .
What can you say now but the very best of luck to him ? """
2005-06-30,"The arrival of Prince William at the Lions team hotel yesterday provided some relief from the pressure the team , and in particular their head coach , have been under this week .
But as Sir Clive Woodward shook the prince 's hand in the packed lobby his thoughts would not have strayed far from the immense task facing him and his side in the Westpac Stadium tomorrow .
With 11 alterations , four of them positional , from the side who failed so depressingly in Christchurch , there has certainly been a significant changing of the guard in terms of Lions ' personnel .
The burning question is whether it will be enough to prevent New Zealand being crowned as convincing series winners , a state of affairs most Kiwis now seem to regard as simply a matter of time .
For perhaps the first time in All Blacks history there is even a sense that the locals would like the Lions to make a game of it .
As New Zealand rugby normally does complacency about as well as Clarence House does takeaway fish and chips , it appears to offer a sliver of hope for Woodward and his Lions side .
That , at least , is the view of their stand - in captain Gareth Thomas who , with his multiple tattoos and visible scar tissue , is no one 's idea of a soft touch .
Thomas may be playing at outside - centre , a position he has not occupied for Wales since the early years of his Test career , but he is adamant his side will give New Zealand a run for their money . ""
This is probably the biggest challenge of our rugby careers .
It 's backs - to - the - wall stuff , everyone 's written us off , no one expects us even to come close , "" said Thomas , who gave his first Lions Test jersey to the All Blacks coach Steve Hansen , previously in charge of Wales , claiming he would not have earned it without the New Zealander 's help .
"" These are the kind of situations you want to be in as a rugby player .
Inside the camp we believe that , if we perform , we can win . ""
The admirably upbeat Thomas , whose success in exporting some Welsh hwyl to Toulouse has clearly persuaded him anything is possible , says the Lions are not unlike a heavyweight boxer caught by an unexpected haymaker in the first round of their previous bout .
"" We have n't thrown anything at them yet as a backline , we have n't had a chance to .
All the talk has been about them , and rightly so , but maybe we can show them some things they 're not prepared for .
"" It will be quite some spectacle if he is right .
Perhaps Jonny Wilkinson will move mountains at the circular stadium beneath Mount Victoria as he did for England in 2003 ; or Gavin Henson and Thomas will dovetail beautifully ; or Shane Williams on the wing will show us all what we have been missing .
Before that can happen , however , the Lions will need some ball and even the withdrawal of the All Blacks prop Carl Hayman with an infected toe can not completely override the memories of what befell the Lions ' pack in Christchurch .
Talking to the All Blacks ' lock Ali Williams , who has a Scottish mother and a father from south - east London , there remains a clear sense of Kiwi disbelief at how badly the Lions ' lineout fared in the first Test .
If it really was a case of New Zealand cracking the visitors ' codes
Williams certainly was not aware of it .
"" I 've never been able to work anyone 's calls out .
All I noticed was that people 's movement was n't as accurate as I 'm sure they wanted it to be . ""
To be on the safe side , Hansen , Graham Henry and Wayne Smith have all been cautioning that the cruel jibes about Steve Thompson 's throwing - his critics call him "" Lightning "" because he never strikes in the same place twice - will not necessarily apply this time .
The Lions ' repeated public attacks on the All Blacks ' captain Tana Umaga , however , may yet prove a psychological own - goal .
Umaga 's team - mates have not taken kindly to what they perceive as cynical media - driven spin .
The truth , as ever , has probably been lost somewhere in the middle for there is no doubt the Lions ' attack coach Eddie O'Sullivan is still seething about the loss of his captain Brian O'Driscoll , victim of the now infamous aerial hoist by Umaga and Keven Mealamu .
Specifically , O'Sullivan reckons Umaga should apologise , not just mutter words of condolence .
"" It 's like kicking a ladder from under somebody then commiserating that they 've had an accident .
He was part of it .
Brian is still a bit upset about that and rightly so .
Things do happen in battle and I accept that .
The incident was not premeditated but I think it was opportunistic and I think he knew exactly what he was doing . ""
Whatever the series outcome , the heated debate looks set to rumble on .
In a city where they have won twice as many post - war Tests as at any other venue in New Zealand , however , the Lions must stay focused .
If Wellington is to be a tour - saving oasis this is not the moment to look back in anger . ·
Joe Rokocoko , the prolific
All Blacks winger omitted from the Test squad , is set to play for Auckland against the Lions next Tuesday ."
2005-07-01,"They 're changing the guard at St James 's Palace .
Prince William 's first official engagements in New Zealand this week were the opening baton change in that strange relay race that is royalty : an event that can take 60 years to run and may , for an unlucky heir , never be completed .
But , by an accident of the American publishing schedule , the prince 's first major performance has been upstaged by the ghost of his mother .
A book by Diana 's self - styled "" energy healer "" Simone Simmons - titled , surely disingenuously , Diana :
The Last Word - has provided a succession of trashy splashes for the redtops .
Di had a one - night stand with JFK Jr !
Princess snorted cocaine !
Diana ordered to carry out DNA tests on her boys after admitting to an affair with James Hewitt !
And yesterday , a small alkaline anecdote thrown into the acid bath of revelations : kind - hearted Di urged Charles to marry Camilla .
This book stands as rubbish even in a genre that has redefined the meaning of garbage .
Just after Diana 's death , there was a rush of mediums claiming to have got through to her .
But why go to the bother of Ouija boards when a "" friend of Diana 's "" ( a description as elastic as bungee - jumping cord ) can be seduced by a large advance into a trance in which they recall knockdown stonkers of stories they strangely failed to remember in earlier books ?
The fact that it 's a memory of sex with President Kennedy 's son that comes through this time shows the extent to which the Diana market is now focused on America , but the enthusiastic filleting of the book in Britain shows how fanciful it was for St James 's Palace to imagine that William 's first solo tour marked the start of a new phase for the royal family .
There was a tacit agreement in the British media that the princes would be more or less protected until adulthood .
But it 's now clear that there was a flaw in this arrangement .
Children are to some extent protected by the limits of their imaginative empathy .
Contemplation of your parents ' sex life is fairly embarrassing when you have n't had sex but becomes much more embarrassing once you have .
At the time of their mother 's death , the boys were young enough to be kept from the worst of the publications and Harry , at least , would have been unable fully to understand the details that reached them .
Talk now of one - night stands , cocaine and DNA tests must be far more painful because they can appreciate the insinuations .
And , shown by exam results to be the brightest of the recent royals , William must be clever enough to see in New Zealand the ridiculousness of being a prince , especially in the third living generation of a dynasty .
When bikini - clad Antipodeans chased the young Prince Charles on his downunder debut more than 30 years ago , they were driven by every non - feminist little girl 's dream of landing the king .
Now , however , many of these women will be grandmothers knitting rugby socks , and Charles , while other men of his age contemplate retirement , is still waiting for his life to have a point .
As heir to the heir , William 's position is even more ludicrous : akin to that of a David Cameron or a George Osborne if Michael Howard were suddenly to announce that he planned to stay in post until 2035 .
Royalty is a system of replacement , but what is being asked of William is particularly hard .
Obliged to wait until his father has stopped waiting before he can start waiting properly , he is also required by those who loved his mother and those who wrote about her to carry on her life , a cruel task complicated by the refusal of her media presence to die .
Perhaps the only shred of luck is that Diana never had a daughter , whose obligation to replace her would have been even greater than that placed on her haunted son ."
2005-07-12,"· At this time of heightened international anxiety about security , officials have been keen to stress that terrorists are no respecters ( among other things ) of class .
How vulgar .
Fortunately , some people still are , if a Sydney Daily Telegraph report on Prince William 's travel arrangements is to be believed .
William passed through Sydney airport with his entourage on Sunday evening , en route back home from New Zealand , and a customs official tells the paper that his highness was "" desperate to have a fag "" whilst on the non - smoking premises .
Knowing the family gift for economy , we 'd imagined if HRH felt like a cigarette he 'd just purchase a 747 on the spot and light up in the loo simply because he could , but perhaps the idea failed to suggest itself to him .
Either way , and despite being a transit passenger for whom such indulgences are strictly forbidden , the paper reports that William was escorted outside the airport in order that the royal craving might be addressed .
It 's not madly exemplary , is it , we observe to Clarence House .
"" We 'd never comment on something like this , "" says a spokesman .

2005-07-14,"This is the biggest week at St Andrews ' Old Course for five years .
The influx of foreign visitors is reminiscent of the frenzy caused by Prince William 's arrival .
Yet this time there is no royalty needed to capture the world 's imagination .
The Open is back at the spiritual home of golf and it has been missed by the locals and those who are visiting .
Apart from the scale of the event the place itself has a magnetic pull for golf fans .
It lacks the stuffy golf club atmosphere that often pervades England and is part of a stunningly picturesque town .
A beautiful beach and crystal - clear sea are within putting distance of the Old Course , and the ancient ruins lie in the distance .
Judi Herd works at the famous golf shop Auchterlonies and is the owner 's daughter .
She expects over 50 % more sales this week than in any other week all year .
"" We are open from 7 am until it gets quiet - last night that was 11 o'clock , "" she said .
"" Just on the practice days it is busy but for Sunday there have been 48,000 tickets sold online .
""
The way in which the course is so entwined with St Andrews itself makes it all the more special and is another reason why so many want to be present .
"" It is the intimacy of the town that does it , "" said David Brown , the owner of the David Brown Gallery in Albany Place which exhibits golfing antiques .
"" It is a small community and people get caught up in it .
They feel a part of it .
In most other places the golf courses are outside of the town or devoid of the town 's character or they are just part of big cities like Edinburgh and Glasgow .
This is unique to St Andrews .
"" This is golf for the people .
On the day before the practice days started there were people walking over the 1st fairway .
People can just turn up and walk the course .
You try that at Augusta and you would get shot .
"" Brown 's gallery helps exhibit the phenomenal golfing past of St Andrews and that sense of heritage is another reason why visitors keep coming back for more . ""
In February , even though it is mid - winter and freezing cold , the place resonates with golfing history , "" said Suzi Kent , TaylorMade Adidas Golf 's European marketing manager .
"" I have been six or seven times now .
The Scottish are very hospitable too .
"" It is also the kind of place where you never forget your first visit .
Kent 's colleague Nick Robbie , the company 's PR executive , would not have missed it for anything .
"" I played here when I was 14 , "" he said .
"" The day before I was really ill
but I was determined to be there .
Even if I was on a drip . ""
"" If you are a golfer this is your Mecca , "" added Kent , a London - based South African whose family and friends will travel all the way from her native land by the end of the week to be here too .
They will be joined from every continent , particularly America , by fellow golf aficionados .
It is hardly surprising ."
2005-09-17,"Prince William stepped further into the limelight yesterday when he was appointed president of the Football Association .
The 23-year - old prince , newly graduated from St Andrews University , will take over the post from his uncle Prince Andrew next year .
This week , he also became patron of one of his late mother 's favourite charities , Centrepoint , which works with homeless youngsters .
The second in line to the throne is virtually the only member of the family ever to have evinced any interest in the national game and has played it , in house matches at Eton and for a Sunday league team while at St Andrews .
He supports Aston Villa , not one of the game 's most glamorous teams , currently nestling in the lower reaches of the Premiership , but is equally enthusiastic about rugby , and is perhaps better known as a polo player .
The prince said : "" Football is a game I love playing and watching .
It is also the national sport and generates extraordinary passion among millions of people .
It certainly did last year for me when I followed England with my friends during Euro 2004 and will no doubt do so again during the World Cup in Germany . ""
The prince will succeed his uncle - who was criticised last year for not turning up often enough to support England - next May , just in time for the World Cup in Germany .
The duke , who became the FA president in 2000 , said : "" I am certain Prince William will be a real asset to the organisation , particularly in his ability to demonstrate the benefits of participation in football to young players . ""
The FA needs an injection of youthful wholesomeness following weeks during which the game has been eclipsed by cricket .
The 142-year - old FA itself has recently been tarnished by revelations of sexual shenanigans .
After meeting the prince yesterday at Clarence House , Geoff Thompson , the FA chairman , said : "" Prince William 's enthusiasm for football both as a player and a fan is well known and we believe his presidency will prove a great asset . """
2005-10-11,"A leading media lawyer has written to the Press Complaints Commission urging it to take action over the publication of photographs of Prince William 's girlfriend out shopping .
Peter Crawford , who represented Amanda Holden in her privacy battle with the Daily Star , believes photographs of Kate Middleton published in the London Evening Standard last week may breach the PCC 's codes on privacy .
Although he does not represent Ms Middleton , Mr Crawford is asking the press watchdog to "" take pro - active steps "" to investigate whether the publication of the photographs broke its rules .
The PCC normally only acts when it receives a complaint from the subject of an article or picture , and is not thought to have received a complaint from the woman .
But it can intervene of its own accord if it believes the code has been breached .
"" I do not know whether Miss Middleton has complained to the commission about the publication of the pictures or whether others may have done so on her behalf
but I do feel she has strong grounds for bringing a complaint , "" Mr Crawford wrote in his letter to the PCC chairman , Sir Christopher Meyer .
The PCC code states that "" it is unacceptable to photograph individuals in private places without their consent "" and defines private places as "" public or private property where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy "" .
The photographs , first published in the Standard and later in the Sun and the Daily Mail , showed Ms Middleton on a No 19 bus and in a shop .
Mr Crawford said he had written to the Evening Standard editor , Veronica Wadley , to protest but had been told his letter would not be published for "" policy "" reasons .
The Standard declined to comment to MediaGuardian.co.uk .
In 2001 Mr Crawford helped Holden and her then husband Les Dennis win a record £ 40,000 settlement from the Daily Star over photographs of the couple at a private villa in Tuscany .
The couple sued the paper under the Human Rights Act after the pictures appeared on the front page of the Star . ·

2005-10-21,"Prince William is to follow his younger brother , Harry , into the army by undergoing officer cadet training at Sandhurst next year after he passed the four - day selection process this week , Clarence House said yesterday .
The prince will be the most senior royal in recent history to train at the academy .
If he succeeds to the throne , he will become head of the armed forces .
The prince , who graduated from St Andrews in the summer , said he was "" delighted "" .
Prince Harry has said he is looking forward to the prospect that his big brother will have to salute him once he graduates next April ."
2005-10-29,"Prince William may have visited yesterday but Alan Curbishley thinks Charlton have an image problem .
The decision of the second in line to the throne to honour Charlton was damnation with faint praise in the manager 's eyes .
"" It 's nice that they 've picked on us , if you like , "" Curbishley said .
"" I think he wanted to come to a Premiership club with not such a high profile . ""
Curbishley then clicked his fingers self deprecatingly .
"" You 've got that here .
Not such a big ballyhoo
but it 's got out somehow .
I do n't know how .
I thought it was a secret .
I did n't even tell my family . ""
He feels the prince - due to become Football Association president next year - showed a genuine interest in the game . ""
Now he 's a top figure at the FA , I think he wants to get more involved , "" he said .
"" I think it 's great that he is a fan albeit of Aston Villa . ""
If the royal family view Charlton as a cosy club , Curbishley fears too many of his players agree with them . ""
The only problem I 've ever had at this club is that when I leave people out it 's fatal , "" he said .
"" Other managers leave people out and it 's ' rotation ' but they do n't seem to grasp it .
If you get left out at Charlton , it 's the end of the world .
I 've just got to change that a little bit . ""
Curbishley wants to take matters into his own hands as Charlton look for a change of image . ""
Perhaps we are not sexy enough , "" he ruefully admits . ""
Perhaps we do n't shout our mouths off [ and ] say things that are going to make you write about us . ""
Charlton 's form suggests that it might not be long before they attain the appeal Curbishley craves .
All he wants is more consistency . ""
To win at Pompey and to beat Chelsea and get the result against Bolton [ today ] would be a fantastic week for us .
We are second .
We 've got to do it and then talk about it afterwards .
That 's how focused we 've got to be . """

( It 's going to be an invasion , G2 , November 18 ) .
I hope that Sepp Blatter ( the president of Fifa ) , Prince William ( soon to take on the presidency of the Football Association ) and all the owners , managers and players of football clubs in this country will join together to condemn and prevent this 21st - century slave labour .
June Jacobs London Richard Williams ( Sport , November 22 ) has a point about the haka ; it is rather silly .
I liked the recent suggestion that the English team should respond with a quick burst of Morris dancing .

At least we English would be spared the depressing Hanoverian dirge played whenever our teams go into action .

Why does Andy Smith think that the Rugby Football Union is a "" non - profit - making "" quango ( Letters , November 21 ) ?

2005-11-30,"A paintballing firm has been rapped by the Advertising Standards Authority for using pictures of Prince William and Prince Harry in its promotional leaflets .
Delta Force paintball centre featured pictures of the two princes , alongside Prince Charles and other members of the royal family , describing them as a "" few of our celebrity guests "" .
Although the royal trio had visited Delta Force , which has outlets across the country , it did not have the consent of the royal family to use their pictures .
The advertising watchdog ruled that the leaflet "" misleadingly implied that they were endorsed by the royal family "" , and asked them to withdraw the leaflet .
In its defence , Delta Force said it had registration forms signed by Prince William , and a thank you letter from former royal nanny Tiggy Legge - Bourke .
In a separate ruling , PC World was reprimanded by the ad watchdog for a TV commercial that exaggerated the availability of wireless internet access .
The advert , which said a £ 499 laptop could be connected to the internet "" wherever you are "" , prompted 65 complaints to the ASA .
Viewers said it gave a misleading impression about the availability of wireless internet connections .
They said it also failed to make clear that another £ 89 of additional items were required to obtain the wireless internet access .
The ASA upheld viewers ' complaints , saying the ad gave a "" misleading impression about the availability of wireless internet connections "" .
PC World said it was "" disappointed by this adjudication , as we believe that the wording was clear "" . ·

2006-01-07,"Prince William begins 44 weeks of officer training at Sandhurst Royal Military Academy tomorrow , becoming the most senior royal to train at the academy in the first step towards his inherited place as the head of the armed forces .
The 23-year - old prince will arrive at Sandhurst , Surrey , with 269 other cadets , accompanied by his father the Prince of Wales .
There he will join his younger brother , Harry , who is due to complete the same officer training in April , although officials at Sandhurst say the two are unlikely to meet .
Over five weeks Prince William will be assigned a company and platoon , banned from leaving the camp , and undergo a gruelling schedule in which he will live in the field , improve his fitness and learn to polish his boots .
By the end of his first term the second in line to the throne will be trained to use a hand grenade , an SA80 5.56 mm rifle and a Browning 9 mm pistol .
He will also receive lectures in first aid , tactics and war studies .
Lieutenant Colonel Roy Parkinson , an instructor at Sandhurst , said Prince William should expect "" very little sleep "" in the first few weeks of his training .
"" We receive people from all backgrounds but background goes right out of the window once training begins .
It 's a team effort here .
If someone steps out of line they 're stamped on , whether they 're a prince or not . ""
' You 're shouted at , screamed at , treated like dirt ' Sandhurst memories Iain Duncan Smith MP Leader of the Opposition 2001 - 03 Officer cadet : 1975
- 76 One memory I have is always having to play catch - up , always lagging behind .
I was the one who was forever late and the one that got punished .
You 're shouted at , screamed at and treated like dirt .
The idea is that you 're spoken to like an ordinary recruit and treated miserably for the first few weeks .
You 're made to run everywhere , never walk .
But the experience taught me to work with others .
Tip :
Get organised - the instructors know every trick in the book .
Sir Chris Bonington Mountaineer Officer cadet : 1953 - 54
I have very good memories of Sandhurst , although in those days the training schedule was less intense than William can expect .
We had a room to ourselves , the food was great and there were servants to polish your brasses .
There was some hierarchy , but our seniors were inspirational men .
I remember drill with Sgt Major Randall , a strict character who had a twinkle in his eye .
Tip :
Get stuck into your environment and enjoy the people around you .
Rt Rev Michael Mann Dean of Windsor 1976 - 89 Officer cadet : 1942 - 43
I was there during the war , so the emphasis was in getting people out quickly to refill the casualties we were suffering .
But the ethos remains similar today : there 's an attention to detail , an emphasis on teamwork and an expectation that only the best is good enough .
In the 1940s there was no need to teach people to obey authority - that came in during the 1960s .
Tip :
Work hard , play hard .
Hugh Robertson MP Shadow sports minister Officer cadet : 1985 - 86 Training staff :
1988 - 89 William will find the first five weeks extremely tough ; I doubt there is a single cadet who at some point during training does n't question if it 's really worth it .
But as a member of the training staff I found that training has to be tough to prepare young men and women to lead in war .
The idea at the start is to bring everyone in a platoon down to the same level , and then teach them the basics : kit cleaning , drills , first aid , weapon handing and basic fitness .
Military tactics and international affairs come later .
Tip :
However hard the training gets , keep smiling and keep cheerful .
Gerald Ogilvie Laing of Kinkell Artist and sculptor Officer cadet : 1953 - 54
I went to Sandhurst to fulfil a romantic ideal .
All my family were involved in wars , and I grew up reading anti - war literature .
I just wanted to go and try it for myself .
It used to be a monk - like environment , we were all bottled up with high testosterone levels and prevented from going to the nearby pub .
But it was the perfect experience for me and taught me the virtues of self - discipline .
I 'm not sure if things remain the same now .
Tip :
He does n't need advice from me given his background ; only the ordinary lads need tips on how to survive .
Lord Carrington Foreign secretary 1979 - 82 Officer cadet : 1937 - 38
The thing that stands out now is how irrelevant the training was to preparations for the second world war .
We were woken - up at dawn and made to ride a horse without a saddle for an hour .
We then ate breakfast , went to the gym , did the parade and spent the remainder of the day learning French or double - entry book - keeping .
During the evenings we 'd go out in Sandhurst and Camberley and when we returned we were made to walk in a straight line , following one drawn in chalk by an officer , to prove that we were sober .
It was tough , but we survived .
Tip :
The Sandhurst of today bears no relation to what it was in my day , so I 'm sure he 'll be fine ."

2006-03-24,"ITV 's director of television , Simon Shaps , unveiled his spring clean of the broadcaster 's schedules yesterday , throwing out any reference to celebrities in programme titles and announcing one - off events featuring big names from Robbie Williams to Prince William .
Last summer proved disastrous for ITV with a ratings collapse caused by flops such as Celebrity Wrestling presaging the autumn shake - up that led to the appointment of Mr Shaps and the departure of most of the senior commissioning team .
One of those flops , Love Island , will return without its Celebrity prefix and will be joined by X - Factor Special Edition , a celebrity version of the musical talent show designed to win viewers from Channel 4 's Big Brother .
But Mr Shaps said ITV would try and "" mix it up a bit "" , introducing a number of new shows designed to appeal to a wide range of viewers rather than just 16 to 34-year - olds .
They include Soccer Aid , a pro - celebrity charity football match pitting an England team captained by Robbie Williams and managed by Terry Venables against a Rest of the World side captained by the chef Gordon Ramsay .
A series of shows will celebrate the 30th birthday of the Prince 's Trust , including an interview by Ant and Dec of Prince Charles and his sons .
The ubiquitous Geordie pair have also been handed their own new quiz show , which has the working title Con .
Test and will offer a £ 1 m prize .
New dramas include See No Evil : The Story of the Moors Murders and Vital Signs , the latest vehicle for the former soap star Tamzin Outhwaite .
Mr Shaps , who refused to be drawn on the takeover speculation engulfing ITV , said the aim of his first season 's launch was to create a "" balanced schedule "" with more of the kind of "" event television "" that draws in viewers .
He said that in such a competitive environment , ITV could no longer afford to save its big guns for the autumn .
The World Cup , which kicks off in June and which ITV shares with the BBC , offers the broadcaster a chance to bring more viewers to its summer schedule .
"" It is an opportunity to hold a string of events around that one mega event , "" said Mr Shaps , previously chief executive of ITV Productions .

2006-05-26,"England 's World Cup preparations took a puzzling turn this week with the news that Prince William has been barred from the team 's dressing room in Germany .
Leaving aside the question of quite what he would have been doing there in the first place - apart from making everyone line up to shake his hand , or saying things like "" whizzo far - post knockdown , Sol , really beazer ! "" - the reasons for his absence are intriguing .
It seems the FA felt obliged to intervene in order to avoid exposing the Prince to "" possibly naked "" players who might also be "" swearing and arguing if they 've lost "" .
Naturally my first reaction was to wonder exactly what kind of place this England dressing room is .
Naked , swearing , argumentative people are all very well 24 hours a day live on E4 with a highlights show hosted by Dermot O'Leary
but it 's hardly the right kind of atmosphere for the flower of the nation 's sportsmen .
Could this be what football people mean when they talk about a dressing - room culture only those "" inside the game "" would understand ?
Ashley Cole nicking someone 's towel ?
Sammy Lee telling John Terry
he 's a right cheeky bleeder ?
If the Prince really is likely to be offended by this - and given that his CV boasts stints in the army and , far worse , an English public school , there is a chance he may already have been exposed to both swearing and male nudity - then perhaps efforts should be made to prevent this kind of activity altogether .
What can we do to stop them ?
One solution would be to train all current squad players in the art of the naked balloon dance , a highly skilled piece of bawdy gentleman 's club erotic artifice whereby the blushes of the heir to the throne might be spared with the use of a few basic inflatables - even while Bridgey and Carra indulge in a light - hearted post - match round of charades , or perhaps a traditional game of flush each other 's head down the toilet and take pictures of it on your mobile .
In fact the problem may not be as bad as it seems at first glance .
The suggestion is that England players get naked , swear and argue only when they 've lost .
Why do they do this ?
Could it be some kind of flagellation ritual , a primitive form of sacrifice to the god of turning it round next time out against Trinidad ?
One person who might have a clue is Prince Harry , who was an ever - present among the jockstrap - flinging high - jinks of England 's rugby World Cup dressing room in Australia .
No one seemed particularly worried about the ginger one then .
Although , let 's face it , he does seem a bit more worldly than his brother , who you feel might conceivably swoon when confronted with a buck naked second - row having his eyelid amputated while singing a song about a girl from Glamorgan .
On the whole this would seem to be a case of cultural misunderstanding .
No one has ever contrived a method of stopping footballers getting naked and swearing .
And there is some evidence Prince William may , in his own way , be up for it anyway .
A statement released by the Prince 's private office shortly after the FA announcement read : "" Cripes , what a swizz .
Do n't tell matron
but I was looking forward to a few rounds of hello sailor before lights out . """
2006-06-12,"Four uniformed British policemen who spent the weekend among England fans in Frankfurt have been a great publicity stunt for the Home Office , but the real police work has been done by others .
With no powers of arrest and forbidden to carry any equipment , the policemen have been instructed to keep away from potentially volatile situations .
So while 44 members of British Transport Police ( with full powers of arrest ) have been operating on the railway system and a team of spotters have been monitoring the 70,000 England fans , the bobbies have provided endless photo opportunities , taken the odd snap themselves and got to meet Prince William .
One , calling himself "" Robbie the Bobby "" has even had time for a spot of self - promotion , handing out cards bearing his photograph to supporters .
A spokeswoman for the Association of Chief Police Officers said the officers had an "" ambassadorial role "" .
"" They are the face of the operation , but we have other officers working to prevent disorder , something we achieved this weekend .
"" There 's Posh for you England 's players received a conjugal visit from their wives and girlfriends at their hotel above Baden - Baden after their victory over Paraguay .

In the unlikely event that she visits a bus stop she will find adverts welcoming her to the town .
Blistering heat Nike , Adidas and Umbro spend millions on promoting their products but they seem unable to give the world 's best players boots that protect them in the heat .
John Terry ( Umbro ) and David Beckham ( Adidas ) complained of blisters after England 's match , and Ronaldo ( Nike ) sat out training last week with four blisters .
Right royal perk David Dein , one of the architects of the Scolari shambles , may have lost his seat on the FA board but as a member of the international committee he retains some of the best perks .
He was among the FA blazer brigade in Frankfurt , who were on their best behaviour with the FA president Prince William in attendance .
The prince 's seat in the VIP box was right next to Sepp Blatter , who could have passed on some useful hints about absolute power .
Accident of birth
The former England manager Graham Taylor , in Germany working for BBC Radio Five Live , had some difficulty getting official accreditation for the World Cup when Fifa claimed he had given them the wrong date of birth in his application .

2006-06-15,"The British establishment turned out en masse today to celebrate the Queen 's official 80th birthday in ceremonies at St Paul 's cathedral and the Mansion House .
More than 2,300 people attended a thanksgiving service in St Paul 's , and 300 more shared a birthday lunch hosted by the Lord Mayor of London in the Mansion House .
Among those at the St Paul 's ceremony were the prime minister , Tony Blair , and his predecessors John Major and Baroness Thatcher , pop stars Cliff Richard and Eric Clapton , and the Queen 's grandsons Prince William and Prince Harry .
The ceremony was hosted by the archbishop of Canterbury , Rowan Williams , and was also attended by other religious leaders including the Muslim college 's Mohammed Raza , chief rabbi Jonathan Sacks , and Gregorios , the Greek orthodox archbishop of Thyateira and Great Britain .
Dr Williams praised the Queen as a "" human face ... that helps to hold us together "" and said that she had experienced the cost of "" a culture fanatically eager for gossip and trivia "" .
"" We have seen something of a monarch who has shared the vulnerability of ordinary people , and that has been moving in itself , "" he said .
"" But more importantly we have been able to see a bit more clearly the personal depth of our monarch 's faith . ""
In her own speech before the Mansion House lunch , the Queen quoted Groucho Marx and made joking reference to the World Cup , saying there would be no "" penalty shoot - outs "" over who could provide the best hospitality .
In reference to Groucho Marx , she said that "" anyone can get old - all you have to do is to live long enough "" , and directed praise towards the charitable work of her husband and son .
The important anniversaries this year should be the 50th anniversary of the Duke of Edinburgh awards scheme and the 30th anniversary of the Prince 's Trust rather than her own 80th birthday , she said .
She also thanked the thousands of people who had delivered birthday messages to the palace in recent months . ""
This has been truly overwhelming and I would like to thank you all for your kindness , "" she said .
The brief speech , delivered wearing an ivory dress and asymmetrical hat , was received by a standing ovation among the diners .
The lunch menu included a mix of traditional British ingredients , including smoked salmon with woodland sorrel and wild cress and turbot with cockles and oxtail .
The prime minister also delivered a speech in which he joked that the Queen ages "" better than your prime ministers "" , and said her influence "" makes the burdens we carry lighter and our lives brighter and better "" .
The ceremonies come two days ahead of her official birthday , which will be marked with the trooping of the colour on Saturday , and nearly two months after her actual birthday in April .
The Queen is the head of state of 16 countries numbering a total population of 128 million people , and she has been served by ten British prime ministers ."
2006-07-01,"Perhaps the tipping point came when Prince William 's girlfriend , Kate Middleton , was reported in a gossip column to have made snide comments about the racy clothes and hard - drinking ways of Prince Harry 's girlfriend , Chelsy Davy .
Or maybe it was when South Africa 's safety and security minister , Charles Nqakula , told the fellow countrymen he called ' constant moaners ' to ' stop bitching or get out ' .
What started on Channel Four 's Big Brother and spread to the World Cup WAGs ( wives and girlfriends ) has gained an unstoppable momentum .
Bitching , it seems , has become an epidemic , as acceptable among quasi - royals and celebrity wannabes as among academics , politicians and the general public .
Not long ago , people preferred to keep their bitching a guilty secret .
Now it has become brash and reckless - just look at Grace Adams - Short , 20 , who was recently voted out of the Big Brother house where she became known as ' Queen Bitch ' .
She called her housemate Aisleyne ' a moose ' , said Richard was ' snidey and two - faced ' and labelled Susie , 44 , ' Lady Muck ' and a ' bitter old hag ' - all behind their backs , of course .
Her bitching was flamboyant , she did n't care if those she tore apart found out , and it made her compulsive viewing .
It was also contagious : fellow contestant Nikki dramatically , possibly melodramatically , confided that Grace was ' the most vile thing God put on Earth ' .
Even when she left the house Grace was unrepentant about her performance . '
It 's second nature to bitch , ' she said .
' I 'm a girl .
When girls get together you ca n't help having a bitch . '
She has a point .
Like Grace , I went to an all - girls school where break - time often descended into a bitch - fest whether it was giggling at some poor unfortunate 's hairstyle - mine as it happened , after a disastrous perm in 1984 left me looking more like Leo Sayer than the intended Keren from Bananarama - or musing over how the weedy music master had found a wife prepared to put up with his body odour and bad breath .
Bitching is a charge often levelled at women .
A study earlier this year said that women bitch about other women 's appearance when they are trying to attract a man .
We are worse in the most fertile part of our menstrual cycle , apparently .
Dr Maryanne Fisher , a psychologist at York University , Canada , who carried out the study , said : ' Evolutionary theory predicts female sexual competition will occur when males of high genetic quality are considered a resource .
One strategy is competitor derogation - using tactics to make a rival inferior . '
So I guess our desire to point our competitors ' cellulite and wonky teeth together with the PMT can play on our moods can make some of us pretty formidable bitches .
Germaine Greer enhanced our bitch status when , in 1995 , she spat venom about Suzanne Moore after Moore commented on an inaccurate report that Greer had had a hysterectomy at 25 .
Greer accused her of having ' hair birds - nested all over the place , fuck - me shoes and three inches of fat cleavage ' .
This was Premier League , a Prada of a bitch .
Cheryl Tweedy , a singer in Girls Aloud , and Charlotte Church are swiftly moving up the divisions as their long - running feud continues .
Tweedy mocked Church for being fat , saying of her Walkers Crisps advert : ' The one where she is stuffing her face ?
Very appropriate . '
Church retorted : ' I do n't want to look like her .
I think when you are that skinny you look miserable because you just ca n't eat . '
Snapping at their heels are the fashion stylists and television presenters Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine .
At the Baftas in 2000 they slated Carol Vorderman 's revealing strapless minidress . '
The problem with Carol Vorderman is that she went from kind of a librarian on Countdown to this sex goddess .
She feels the need to show off as much as possible , ' they said .
Vorderman hit back , describing Trinny as an ' anorexic transvestite ' and Susannah as a ' carthorse in a badly fitting bin liner ' .
It may be hard to imagine David Beckham giving Frank Lampard a rundown of where Wayne Rooney is going wrong with his hair , but men love to bitch too .
They 'll deny it , of course .
As Bette Davis , a leading member of bitch brigade , said : ' When a man gives his opinion , he 's a man .
When a woman gives her opinion , she 's a bitch . '
In fact , there is evidence to show that men are the bigger bitches .
Research published in the Journal of Personal Relationships last month by a team of psychologists at Oklahoma University concluded that men are twice as likely as women to be venomous about someone 's appearance .
Look no further than Gordon Ramsay , who when critics compared him with 46-year - old Simon Cowell this week , remarked : ' I 'm 39 and my boobs are n't as big as Simon 's . '
Then there 's Piers Morgan , the former editor of the Mirror , who described Private Eye editor Ian Hislop as a ' moon - faced midget ' and ' a poisonous little twerp ' in 2002 before launching a campaign offering readers £ 50 for any scandal on him .
Politicians are past masters at back - biting .
We do n't often get to hear it in an attributable form , which is why the bitchy opinions of David Blunkett on his then fellow cabinet ministers were greeted with such a brouhaha when they were revealed by his biographer Stephen Pollard in late 2004 .
In his book , Pollard claimed Blunkett said that the then Education Secretary , Charles Clarke , had ' gone soft ' , Gordon Brown ' throws his weight around ' and the Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell was ' weak ' over relaxing drinking laws .
Professor Nigel Nicholson , a psychologist at the London Business School and author of Managing the Human Animal , said : ' Men do it as much as women .
Gossip is ingrained in the human design .
Women 's gossip is about inclusion , who 's in and who 's out ; bitching is a negative form of that .
Men do their own kind of bitching - who 's up and who 's down . '
The World Cup WAGs are a good example of this .
The younger girls , nicknamed the ' hen - night crowd ' and led by Coleen McLoughlin , dance on tables and drink until the early hours while No . 1 WAG Victoria Beckham remains aloof , dining sedately with Ashley Cole 's fiancee , Cheryl Tweedy .
Reports of bitchy behaviour include the news that Victoria is keeping a scorecard for the fashion sense of the others , marking their outfits out of 10 on her ' Vic - ometer ' .
The verdict on Steven Gerrard 's fiancee Alex Curran was said to be ' could do better ' and Peter Crouch 's girlfriend Abigail Clancy was dismissed as ' too obvious ' .
Relationships between the girls were further strained , according to the gossip columnists , when Joe Cole 's girlfriend , Carly Zucker , a 20-year - old fitness instructor much loved by the paparazzi , said she thought Victoria looked ' emaciated ' .
This filtered back to Victoria and she retorted by saying Carly looked ' beefy and masculine ' .
And so it goes on .
There is more opportunity for bitching these days .
Stitch ' n ' Bitch groups , where women with a shared love of cashmere - merino mix and Fair Isle patterns meet for a knit and a gossip , can be found worldwide .
The proliferation of women 's magazines with pages of photographs of famous people caught at the wrong angle are pored over by readers delighting in the bitchy editorial .
Then there are numerous websites and blogs where you can moan about everything from your boss to the state of the nation 's grammar and myriad books about bitching , including Why Men Marry Bitches : A Woman 's Guide to Winning Her Man 's Heart , Getting in Touch with your Inner Bitch , and You Say I 'm A Bitch
Like It 's A Bad Thing
Professor Geoffrey Beattie , of Manchester University , said magazines and the internet encourages negative gossip . '
Bitching is about social bonding .
You are picking some negative characteristics of a third person and saying , "" I trust you enough to tell you my view of it
and I think you
and I hold similar views and we will form a coalition . "" '
But is all this bitching good for us ?
The Oklahoma psychology team 's conclude that it ' promotes closeness and friendship ' and can boost self - esteem . '
We do not deny that gossip behaviour has it drawbacks , ' the team states . '
Still , we believe it is that shared , mild , negative attitudes toward others can create and/or amplify interpersonal intimacy . '
That 's all very well until you 're the subject of the bitching .
I was late for a ballet class as a plump 11-year - old . '
We were all wondering when the fat girl would get here , ' said one girl .
Hot tears rolling down my face , I spent the class imagining the conversation the others were enjoying before my arrival .
It was a harsh introduction to the fact that people talk about other people behind their backs .
Life , as they say , is a bitch .
And here 's how to do it ...

2006-08-09,"The police investigation into alleged phone tapping of the royal family has been expanded to "" dozens of celebrities and cabinet ministers "" , according to the ITV News political editor Tom Bradby .
Bradby , speaking on today 's ITV1 12.30pm news bulletin , said the eight - month police investigation had been launched after details of a private meeting he had arranged with Prince William when he was ITV News royal correspondent appeared in the News of the World .
The investigation led to yesterday 's arrest of NoW royal editor Clive Goodman and two other unnamed men , one of whom has since been released on bail .
Bradby said the investigation into alleged interception of royal calls began by looking into a "" localised incident in Clarence House "" , but was handed over to anti - terrorist police IT specialists who discovered that far more people , including celebrities and cabinet ministers , were affected .
"" What happened was basically that I was supposed to have a private meeting with Prince William
and I was pretty surprised that not only the details of the meeting , but what we were going to discuss , pitched up in the News of the World , "" Bradby said .
"" So when he and I hooked up , we both looked at each other and said ' now , how on earth did that get out ? ' .
And we worked out that only he and I and two people incredibly close to him had actually known about it .
"" We started discussing one or two other things that had been happening recently , there had been a meeting he 'd had with a knee surgeon that only he and his personal secretary and the knee surgeon had known about , that had got into the News of the World . ""
And basically the answer we came up with is that
well , it must be something like breaking into mobile answering machine messages .
Now his chief of staff is a former SAS officer and his attitude was ' if this potentially happening to us , then who on earth else could this be happening to ' . ""
He passed his concerns on to the police and the police had a small investigation to begin with into the localised incident in Clarence House . ""
And what they discovered then alarmed them enough to hand it over to IT specialists within the anti - terrorist police who looked much more broadly and , basically , what they discovered was , yes , this does effect lots of other people , dozens of celebrities I 'm told , and cabinet ministers and goodness knows who else besides .
"" The original News of the World Diary piece that Bradby refers to was published on November 13 , under Clive Goodman 's byline .
Headlined "" Pin - up Political Editor Tom Bradbury "" ( sic ) , the article said : "" If ITN do a stocktake on their portable editing suites this week , they might notice they 're one down .
That 's because their pin - up political editor Tom Bradbury has lent it to close pal Prince William so he can edit together all his gap - year videos and DVDs into one very posh home movie . ""
At least William , who demands to be left in peace by the media , can be confident his secret is safe at that rumour sieve ITN - and that it wo n't get out and infuriate the BBC .
Oops . ""
A spokesman for Scotland Yard said he could not confirm whether celebrities and cabinet ministers were involved in the police investigation , but said many famous people telephoned the royal household . ""
A lot of people ring the royal household , royal staff and members of the royal family .
Those numbers are used by a lot of people , "" he said .

2006-08-09,"The Scotland Yard investigation into the alleged interception of royal phone calls was triggered by ITV News 's then royal reporter Tom Bradby .
Last year , Bradby , now ITV News 's political editor , had a private conversation with an aide at Clarence House about a possible television project involving Prince William .
Shortly afterwards , a diary story appeared in the News of the World that is understood to have contained information that was discussed in the conversation between Bradby and Clarence House .
Because the contents of that private conversation were known only by a small number of people , palace officials became suspicious and decided to involve the police .
The eight - month investigation began .
Scotland Yard is investigating how long the alleged phone interceptions have been going on for , amid claims that it could have been a year or more .
A cabinet minister and celebrities are believed to be among those allegedly affected .
Meanwhile , former royal press officer Dickie Arbiter said it was very unlikely the Prince of Wales would have left voicemail messages on the mobile phones of staff in his household .
On the repercussions of the police investigation , he added : "" The staff will probably be taking advice on what they should be doing . ""
News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman remains in custody at Charing Cross police station this morning , with one other man .
The police have been granted a 12-hour extension to question them .
Another man who was arrested has been released on bail .
Goodman and two other men were arrested early yesterday in south London by police investigating allegations that members of Britain 's royal household - including Prince Charles - may have had their mobile phone calls intercepted .

2006-09-21,"Prince William is to follow his younger brother , Harry , into the Household Cavalry regiment the Blues and Royals when he graduates from Sandhurst at the end of this year , Clarence House said yesterday .
As a troop leader , he will take charge of about a dozen soldiers and four Scimitar reconnaissance vehicles , though it is not known whether he will serve in a conflict zone .
After about a year in the army , the prince , who is second in line to the throne , will spend time with the RAF and Royal Navy on "" familiarisation attachments "" and will also receive training in constitutional affairs ."
2006-11-08,"Prince William was denied entry to a "" VIP lounge "" on the Pride of Kent P&amp;O ferry between Dover and Calais during half - term week because he had neglected to buy a seat in advance .
Sent packing to the lower decks by a stewardess , who told him it was fully booked , William and his party endured the indignity of having to pay for their beverages rather than receive free ones .
It is the ultimate royal feelgood story .
Fans of the late Diana could see a little of her in William 's eschewing of gold - plated helicopters in favour of humble car ferries .
For the rest of us , it afforded a rare opportunity to imagine an heir to the throne enduring an Oliver Twist moment - gazing through shut bars at a pampered world of foamy cappuccino , soft leather sofas and ample legroom .
So what did he miss as he roughed it with the booze - cruisers , wild children and long - distance lorry drivers ?
Once the only solace afforded to first - class passengers on cross - channel ferries was a small area of relative calm where the only discernible difference to the seats was a tissue taped to the headrest .
Today the ships are much more pleasant , and companies such as P&amp;O market their club lounges as affordable slices of luxury for everyone - a snip at £ 10 per person if booked in advance - where free champagne , coffee , soft drinks and newspapers are delivered by blue - uniformed attendants in an environment not unlike a floating DFS showroom .
Businessmen can enjoy wi - fi access , the elderly can recline in a world free from fruit machines and queues .
It 's nice - like a protected patch of Surrey village green in the middle of a Halifax industrial estate .
The best bit is that for £ 2 extra , you can leave the ferry before everyone else .
After all , it 's not that good ."
2006-11-09,"Oh dear .
Just as the memory of Prince William joining his officer - class pals in ' chav ' fancy dress begins to fade , so some bright spark thinks that the offer of an evening of class tourism might just make them a bit of money .
Over Christmas , those who think panto is just so 20th century , can sample an alternative at London 's Barbican Centre : a nightly event called the Class Club , in which ticket - holders are offered the chance to get "" socially mobile for one night only and choose your class - lower class , middle class or upper class .
"" Each tier gets its own kind of dinner , and "" appropriate "" entertainment , on the strict proviso that , "" Audience members are requested to dress appropriately for their chosen class "" .
So , off we go again .
What with Hoxton Square , Islington and Clerkenwell mere minutes away , there should be no shortage of takers .
And , given the current vogue for laughing at the proles and the fact that "" lower class "" tickets come in at only £ 14.99 ( as opposed to the £ 40 for "" upper class "" ) , you can bet which stratum will prove to be the most popular .
Saggy casualwear , "" pramface "" jokes and Vicki Pollard impressions are sure to be obligatory ; exactly how the "" entertainment "" will turn out is an interesting question , though I imagine it will be based around a mélange of bingo , trad stand - up and caricatured ( probably northern ) accents .
What larks !
Taking issue with any of this can , of course , look hopelessly po - faced .
Given that the middle and upper classes are also represented , the people responsible will doubtless claim that this is a work of across - the - board social satire rather than a pop at the lower orders .
But never mind all that : if just one public schoolie shows up in a tracksuit , that will be enough for me .
Whether you call it New Snobbery or a kind of socio - economic blackface , it does n't need encouraging .
And besides , there 's another point which only serves to point up the cluelessness of the whole Class Club enterprise : the fact that the upper and lower classes - or , to be more specific , the aristocracy and proletariat - have long subsisted on much the same diet ( if you doubt this , check out what the Queen eats ) .
It 's one of the reasons why Britain won two world wars , you know .
Anyway , to truly cement the Barbican production in its proper context , I 'll quote two bits of text .
The first is from last year 's epochal bestseller
Is It Me Or Is Everything
Shit ?
: "" The poor are a right laugh : look , they do n't have much money !
Ha ha ha .
But there 's a downside , too : they sometimes have bad skin because they do n't used the correct sea salt - based exfoliant scrubs , and they can be violent .
"" To get very serious for a moment , consider also this passage written by the Labour MP and deputy leadership candidate Jon Cruddas : "" In popular culture , the working class is everywhere , albeit successively demonised in comedy or in debate around fear , crime and antisocial behaviour - seen through caricature while patronised by reality TV .
Arguably , the cumulative effect of this is that the working class itself has been dehumanised - now to be feared and simultaneously served up as entertainment .
"" It makes sense to me .
If only by way of demonstrating a backhanded wit , the Barbican might want to put it in the programme .
Anyway , if any well - heeled readers are thinking of a quick trip to JD sports and a rollicking Christmas evening in EC1 , here 's a challenge .
How about straying into a nearby proletarian quarter , going for a quick pint , and finding out just how convincing your get - up really is ?
Go on !
Dare you !"

2006-11-29,"The Sun editor , Rebekah Wade , was a victim of the mobile phone sting that saw two men plead guilty to charges of unlawfully intercepting voicemail messages at the Old Bailey today .
Ms Wade 's mobile phone messages were accessed by former AFC Wimbledon footballer Glenn Mulcaire .
Mr Mulcaire today admitted one charge of plotting to intercept private phone messages and five charges of unlawfully intercepting voicemail messages left by a number of people , including staff of Prince William and Prince Harry , publicist Max Clifford and model Elle Macpherson .
However , Ms Wade did not press charges and her name was not mentioned in court .
The Sun refused to comment , but MediaGuardian.co.uk has estabished that Ms Wade 's voicemail messages were intercepted .
"" Rebekah 's phone was tapped by Mulcaire , "" said a source who did not wish to be identified .
"" She only found out about it when she was told by the counter terrorism squad , "" the source said .
"" The News of the World did not have a clue that this was going on . ""
Glenn "" Trigger "" Mulcaire was a player and assistant manager with AFC Wimbledon in 2002 .
He runs Nine Consultancy , a Chelsea - based firm described as a "" crisis management consultancy "" .
The source denied that the News of the World royal editor , Clive Goodman - who pleaded guilty to a charge of plotting to intercept private phone messages - knew that Ms Wade 's phone was tapped .
Ms Wade worked with Goodman when she edited the News of the World from 2000 to 2003 before she was succeeded by Andy Coulson and is known to be great friends with her successor .
Simon Hughes MP , Gordon Taylor , the chief executive of the Professional Footballers Association , and Andrew Skylet , agent for England defender Sol Campbell , also were identified as people who had messages intercepted by Mr Mulcaire .
The News of the World has apologised to the royal family for the phone interceptions and invasion of privacy .
Mr Mulcaire and Goodman are due to be sentence after January 12 and face a two - year jail term .

2006-11-30,"Revelations of a sustained bugging campaign targeting two government ministers , a newspaper editor , an England footballer and a string of celebrities prompted calls yesterday for tougher sentences for the buying and selling of confidential personal data .
The government 's information commissioner spoke out after Clive Goodman , the News of the World 's royal editor , admitted at the Old Bailey yesterday to tapping into mobile phones belonging to aides of the Prince of Wales and his son , Prince William , over a 20 month period .
Goodman , 48 , faces up to two years in jail for conspiracy to intercept communications contrary to the Criminal Law Act 1977 .
Mr Justice Goss agreed to remand him on unconditional bail for pre - sentence reports but he warned : "" I am not ruling out any options .
It 's a very serious matter . ""
Glenn Mulcaire , a former footballer turned private detective who was hired by Goodman , admitted the same charge .
He also pleaded guilty to five charges of unlawfully intercepting voicemail messages left by Max Clifford , the publicist , Skylet Andrew , who is agent for the footballer Sol Campbell , Gordon Taylor , chairman of the Professional Footballers ' Association , the MP Simon Hughes and the model Elle Macpherson .
Fourteen other charges were allowed to lie on file .
But the high profile figures named in the criminal charges were the tip of the iceberg , legal sources say .
Detectives from Scotland Yard 's counter terrorism unit , who investigated the tapping , uncovered a string of other targets : figures including two government ministers , footballers , a newspaper editor , celebrities and models .
They drew up a list which is understood to contain the names of David Blunkett when he was home secretary , the government minister David Miliband and Rebekah Wade , editor of the News of the World 's sister paper , the Sun .
Yesterday 's prosecution added weight to a wider call for a clampdown on the trade in personal information .
Last night Richard Thomas , the information commissioner , said in a statement : "" Information obtained improperly , very often by means of deception , can cause significant harm and distress to individuals .
The information commissioner has called for prison sentences of up to two years for people who take part in this illegal trade in personal information . ""
Sir Christopher Meyer , chairman of the Press Complaints Commission , said the board would review the journalists ' code of practice in light of the case . ""
[ We ] are absolutely clear on the issue of phone message tapping : it is a totally unacceptable practice unless there is a compelling public interest reason for carrying it out , "" he said Goodman and his editor , Andy Coulson , immediately issued an apology to the royal household .
Coulson said : "" Clive Goodman 's actions were entirely wrong and I have put in place measures to ensure they will not be repeated by any member of my staff .
I have written today to Sir Michael Peat , the Prince of Wales 's private secretary , to this effect . ""
The prince is understood to be unhappy about the way photographers follow his sons and their girlfriends .
Clarence House is believed to be considering legal action to limit the behaviour of tabloid journalists if the industry can not reform itself , and hopes this case may prompt changes ..
Simon Hughes , the Liberal Democrat MP whose voicemail was intercepted , said : "" I have long held the view that courts should be allowed to deprive those responsible for this sort of behaviour of their liberty because it is a serious offence to interfere with the freedoms of others . """
2006-12-15,"Prince William graduated today from Sandhurst military academy and received his commission as an army officer .
The second in line to the throne joins the Blues and Royals , the regiment in which his brother , Harry , is already serving and one of two that make up the Household Cavalry .
William 's girlfriend , Kate Middleton , was at Camberley , Surrey , to watch the passing - out ceremony on the historic parade ground , where his grandmother , the Queen , reviewed the troops .
The general officer commanding the Household Division , who is ultimately William 's new commander , said the prince would begin the next stage of his army life with his regiment in Windsor .
Major General Sebastian Roberts warned that sending the prince to a conflict zone could not be ruled in or out , noting that the Blues and Royals deployed "" a great deal "" .
Troops from the regiment have served in the Falklands conflict , the 1991 Gulf war , Bosnia , Kosovo and in Iraq , as well as Northern Ireland .
Asked whether William would serve in dangerous situations , Maj Gen Roberts said : "" In general there are a lot of different factors that need to be taken into account . ""
Of course , there are special factors for William , but nothing should be ruled in or out . ""
William , who will one day be head of the armed forces , must also undertake familiarisation attachments with the air force and navy at some stage .
He joined the Blues and Royals with the aim of becoming an armoured reconnaissance troop leader .
Maj Gen Roberts said : "" The details are not certain , but it 's true to say , bearing in mind his future commitments ... he will have an unusual military career .
"" I gather he has done well at Sandhurst .
We hope he 'll serve for as long as possible . ""
He said it was unusual for two royal brothers to both be in the army as well as in the same regiment .
"" I ca n't think of when there were two royal princes together , but there 's a lot of instances of brothers serving together . ""
The prince 's passing - out parade came a day after the Stevens report concluded that the 1997 death of his mother , Diana , Princess of Wales , in a Paris tunnel crash had been an accident , and that the princess had not been the victim of a conspiracy .
Princes William and Harry , who were told of the findings on Wednesday , said in a statement that they were extremely grateful to Lord Stevens and his team for their thoroughness and professionalism , and hoped the findings would end the speculation surrounding the death of their mother ."
2006-12-16,""" Well , no one 's fallen over or fainted so far , so things are going well , "" one senior officer said yesterday , arching an eyebrow as he watched the Sandhurst passing - out ceremony at which Prince William formally completed his army training .
The risk of passing out during passing - out is a hoary old joke at the military academy , but hypothermia seemed the more likely hazard on a bleak and wind - whipped morning , as the Queen inspected more than 220 newly qualified officers , including her grandson , while her son gazed expressionlessly from the sidelines , his wife , Camilla , by his side .
In the outside world , the news media were frenetically digesting Lord Stevens ' report into the death of Diana , picking over the remnants of demolished conspiracy theories and trying to build a new one out of Charles 's alleged love for Tiggy Legge - Bourke , the princes ' former nanny .
But in the leafy grounds of Sandhurst , ringed by machine gun - wielding guards , the feverishness seemed remote .
Pomp was the order of the day : salutes and march - pasts , and a memorable if baffling moment when a horse was ridden up Sandhurst 's steps and through its front door .
For those given to kremlinological analysis of the royals , it was a significant event for another reason : for the first time at a public event attended by senior members of the family , Prince William 's long - term girlfriend , Kate Middleton attended as his guest .
The prince has said he has no current plans to marry , but that seems unlikely to be enough to quell speculation that Ms Middleton , William 's former university flatmate , is being groomed for a potential future role as a princess .
She wore a red winter coat , as did the Queen , but a protocol catastrophe was narrowly averted thanks to the fact that Ms Middleton 's was scarlet , whereas the monarch 's , onlookers agreed , was claret .
At one point , she turned to those nearby and uttered something that had onlookers speculating and TV producers reaching for their directories of lip - reading experts .
ITV News duly produced a practitioner who interpreted her brief aside as : "" I love the uniform .
It 's so so sexy . ""
At the centre of yesterday 's ceremony was the Queen 's inspection of the assembled cadets .
She spoke briefly to William , but if the idea of being inspected by his grandmother fazed the prince - a brief mental image , perhaps , of a handkerchief whipped out , spat upon and used to wipe away a smudge - he did not show it .
Like everyone else , he just looked cold , though he briefly grinned at some words from Elizabeth that spectators could not hear .
Much has been made of William having been treated like any other cadet during training .
The few distinguishing features of his outfit yesterday - he wore a red sash and carried a rifle with bayonet instead of a ceremonial sword - were signs not of royal status but the fact that his platoon had won the right to carry the sovereign 's banner , a prize for which recruits compete during the 44 weeks of sometimes gruelling training . ""
A great deal will be expected of you , "" the Queen later told the new officers as Prince Philip stood at her side , looking vaguely irritated .
Among the dignitaries were William 's godfather , the former King of Greece , Constantine .
"" You must be courageous yet selfless , leaders yet carers , confident yet considerate , "" the Queen told the new officers . ""
And you must be all these things in some of the most challenging environments around the world ...
But those whom you will command , and your country too , will expect nothing less . ""
William will join the Household Cavalry 's Blues and Royals , like his brother Harry , who passed out from Sandhurst in April .
He becomes a second lieutenant and will now train to become a troop commander in an armoured reconnaissance unit , before taking on familiarisation attachments with the RAF and Navy in preparation for his future royal duties .
Despite speculation that the older prince would yesterday be awarded the sword of honour , which traditionally goes to the cadet judged to have performed the best during the Sandhurst course , it went to junior under - officer Angela Laycock , who the academy was eager to note had begun her education in a state school .
Later , the first official group portrait of the royal family featuring Camilla was unveiled in the grand entrance of the college for the Queen .
The picture by Sergei Pavlenko was painted from images of the royals gathered on the building 's steps taken when Harry passed out ."
2007-01-02,"The Press Complaints Commission is set to demand answers from News of the World editor Andy Coulson over the royal phone tapping affair .
The PCC will wait until the after Sunday tabloid 's royal editor Clive Goodman is sentenced for his crime later this month .
He pleaded guilty to plotting to intercept phone messages left on the mobile phones of staff of Prince William and Prince Harry . ""
The commission has discussed the issue of phone message tapping in light of the Clive Goodman case , "" the PCC said in a statement today .
"" It resolved to write to the editor of the News of the World with a number of questions arising from the matter , once sentencing has taken place . ""
The PCC board discussed the case at its December meeting .
Its next meeting is due on January 24 .
Goodman and his co - conspirator , former Wimbledon footballer Glenn Mulcaire , face a maximum two - year prison sentence and are due to be sentenced some time after January 12 .
Mr Coulson apologised to Princes William and Harry in November for invading their privacy , saying the actions of his reporter were "" entirely wrong "" .
He accepted "" ultimate responsibility "" for the actions of the Goodman . ""
I apologise unreservedly on behalf of the News of the World to Prince William and Prince Harry , Paddy Harverson , Helen Asprey and Jamie Lowther - Pinkerton for the distress caused by this invasion into their privacy , "" Mr Coulson said .

2007-01-08,"A souvenir plate anticipating the wedding of Prince Charles and Kate Middleton .
Image : by Woolworths via Getty Images .
It is clear , now , that Prince William and Miss Kate Middleton are moving towards a formal engagement .
The number of paparazzi outside Miss Middleton 's Chelsea home each day is an indication : as is the enhanced formal security with which Kate has been provided .
William , 24 , and Kate , 25 on 9 January will have been together for three years , and that 's a good time to go ahead and tie the knot .
Long enough to have developed a lasting relationship , but not so long that the sheen has worn off it .
I have turned into one of those older women who are greatly pleased by stories of royal engagements , royal weddings , and royal babies .
It is a narrative which appeals to our sense of continuity and ritual , and which is not , by the way , affected or inhibited by political bias : I know many an Irish Republican grandma who reads every line about royal family stories in the illustrated magazines .
Not to mention the French Republicans who do likewise .
But I think the wedding of William is to be particularly welcomed , for psychological reasons : it has long been observed that young men who lose their mothers at a young age need to recreate their own family life as soon as they reasonably can .
The loss of his mother in his early teens must have been a deep wound to William , and that loss must have been a factor in his relatively early attachment to Kate .
It 's good that he has found someone to be his partner in life - who would n't be pleased for him ?
Miss Middleton also seems an eminently suitable choice - and suitability is an important factor in the making of marriages and relationships .
Suitable , above all , in the sense of character .
She is not an aristocrat , but she comes from a world that understands such milieux .
She comes from an intact and stable family background ; and she has had a good education , at Marlborough School and afterwards at St Andrews University , two advantages that were denied the late Princess Diana , who clearly suffered from maternal deprivation when her mother left home , and who had never been provided with a proper education .
Neither have the powers that be insisted that Miss Middleton should be virgo intacta - another pressure placed on Diana .
Tolerance has been extended towards Kate 's live - in relationship with William , which reflects the mores of our times .
Miss Middleton 's life will change inexorably once she becomes Princess - of - Wales in waiting , and she will need plenty of good sense and fortitude to withstand a lifetime 's intrusiveness from the paparazzi , whose existence in itself proves the public 's appetite for royal celebs .
Yet that is the reality of the unspoken contract between royalty and the public : they yield a certain degree of private life in exchange for their privileges .
Better to face that contract with open eyes .
Some marriage experts are critical of young marriages , warning that these are more likely to break down .
Maybe .
But surely it 's better to try and to fail , than never to try at all .
And even when marriages fail , people learn from that failure .
Walter Bagehot famously said , "" A princely marriage is the brilliant edition of a universal fact . ""
Quite : marriage is to be encouraged as an everyday fact , and princely weddings are an enjoyable way of setting the template .
So bring on the princely wedding soon : say , in September this year , after the music concert for Diana , Princess of Wales , whose memory should be peacefully laid to rest as the next generation recommences the cycle of family life ."
2007-01-08,"Anyone closely associated with the royal family must expect to fascinate the media , all the more so when the association is romantic and with a likely king .
But the present explosion of interest in the relationship between Prince William and Kate Middleton , filling many pages of many newspapers last week , is leading some photographers who follow the couple to behave in a disturbing way .
If ordinary human courtesy is insufficient to moderate such behaviour then the media 's own self - interest should .
As preliminary hearings in the inquest into the death of Diana , Princess of Wales , resume today , it is obvious that media behaviour has changed less than was promised after she died .
Ms Middleton , who remains a private citizen with a job and a flat in London , has had to put up with scrutiny of her life since her relationship with Prince William became public three years ago .
She can hardly expect otherwise , but that should not open all aspects of her existence to a free - for - all .
Chasing her to work in blacked - out vans and on motorbikes , the scrum of photographers surrounding her has reached such unpleasant proportions that at times the police have been called out to manage it .
Last week that created the absurd situation where newspapers ran stories about her safety - and used snatched images to illustrate them .
The effect of all this on the individuals involved can only be imagined , but the consequences for press freedom matter too .
In a series of cases the courts have moved to fill the vacuum left by the absence of a privacy law .
Ms Middleton has so far confined her complaints to appeals to editors , avoiding court action or a formal protest through the Press Complaints Commission .
But faced with continued extreme behaviour by photographers , that could change and other cases will be brought in which the courts may take the right to privacy further .
That would limit serious reporting .
Sympathy for one individual should not be grounds for changing the law , but if the media environment around Ms Middleton remains in its present hysteria there will be calls to do so .
The heavy hand of parliamentary legislation would be the worst outcome , but even a continued clampdown by the courts in new cases would produce unintended consequences for open reporting .
The law on privacy is in flux .
A degree of self - restraint by the press , avoiding using pictures of Ms Middleton on her own in her daily life , would reduce the enthusiasm of freelance photographers for taking them .
That would benefit not just the royal couple but journalism too .
Those of us who stand firmly behind press freedom need to remind ourselves that there is a difference between liberty and taking liberties ."
2007-01-10,"Lawyers for Kate Middleton , Prince William 's girlfriend , appear to have succeeded in persuading photographers to stop harassing her .
Only two photographers were outside her flat today , according to radio reports , compared with 20 that appeared yesterday to photograph her on her 25th birthday .
But a small crowd of reporters turned up outside her West London flat to monitor the number of photographers staking out her home .
Today the Daily Star , owned by Express Newspapers , was the only newspaper to use a paparazzi picture , from the celebrity and paparazzi agency Solarpix .
The Daily Mail , owned by Associated Newspapers , refused to publicly back News International 's ban on publishing paparazzi photographs of Ms Middleton .
In a statement today the Daily Mail said : "" The PCC has very strict guidelines in respect of privacy , harassment and photographing individuals . ""
As always the Daily Mail will respect both the letter and spirit of those rules .
It will do nothing likely to cause distress or upset to Miss Kate Middleton and will always act responsibly in respect of any photographs taken of her . ""
But the Mail was at pains to point out that it did not publish any paparazzi photographs of Ms Middleton today , in a caption that stated that its photographs were "" taken yesterday by the Press Association , AP and the respected Getty Images "" .
Yesterday Express Newspapers said all its papers exercised "" caution and restraint on pictures of Kate Middleton "" whether taken by paparazzi , agency or staff photographers .
"" We would want to make all our decisions on what pictures to use in a spirit of respect for Kate Middleton , the royal family , and indeed many other individuals whom we show as part of our news coverage , "" a spokesman said .
Today the Daily Express used pictures "" taken by the respected Press Association "" .
The Guardian used a photograph of paparazzi lined up outside her home taken by Getty Images and the Times used a Press Association photograph .
The Sun and Daily Telegraph used a stock photograph of Kate Middleton taken at Prince William 's passing out ceremony at Sandhurst . ·

2007-01-10,"News International has made much of its unilateral declaration that it will not publish paparazzi pictures of Prince William 's girlfriend , Kate Middleton .
But before we heap praise on Rupert Murdoch 's group for its ethical stance , let 's ask a key question .
What is a paparazzo picture ?
Few of the photographers who have been making life so uncomfortable for Ms Middleton - as they did for Princess Diana - will admit to being paparazzi .
( They might have done so once , but the title has - especially since Diana 's death in 1997 - lost any semblance of the movie glamour associated with its La Dolce Vita origins ) .
Instead , the pack of snappers haunting Ms Middleton fall into many categories : newspaper staffers , picture agency staffers , accredited freelancers , assorted stringers , individual freelances and amateurs on the make , what I call stalkers with cameras or the stalkerazzi .
Which of these are paparazzi ?
To show how complicated it is , consider the problem of delineating what is , and is not , a picture agency .
There is a world of difference between , say , Associated Press , the international news agency , and Big Pictures , a London - based outfit which calls itself , with typical understatement , "" the world 's biggest and best celebrity picture agency "" , which claims to represent 1,000 photographers , many of whom are nothing more than stalkerazzi .
It is run by a former Daily Mail photographer , Darryn Lyons , whose extraordinary antics were the central feature of two BBC TV series entitled Paparazzi .
So there ca n't be any doubt that his snappers are paps .
But what about a supposedly reputable agency such as the American - based Keystone Press ?
A net search reveals that one of its agency pictures of Ms Middleton , showing her in a clothing store changing room is one of the most intrusive .
It definitely qualifies as a paparazzo shot , does it not ?
So , I ask again , what does News International mean by refusing to run paparazzi pictures ?
Surely its statement is no more than a piece of disingenuous hype .
Unless the photographer identifies him / herself as a paparazzo , then The Sun and the News of the World ( not to mention The Times and Sunday Times ) will be able to dissemble , arguing that a published picture of Ms Middleton came from "" an accredited freelance "" or "" a reputable agency "" .
In other words , a paparazzo .
On the other hand , perhaps News International 's supremo , Les Hinton , is being entirely sincere in his desire not to upset Prince William by imposing the ban on his editors .
Rest assured , I will be seeking the provenance of every picture his papers run of Ms Middleton in the coming months ."
2007-01-12,"Kate Middleton Paparazzi harassment of Prince William 's girlfriend , Kate Middleton , was condemned as "" appalling "" by the Commons leader , Jack Straw .
He praised News International for a self - imposed ban on using paparazzi shots of Ms Middleton and urged other news groups to follow suit . '
Cash for honours ' inquiry
The government denied there was a "" conflict of interest "" in the attorney general 's role in any prosecution that may flow from the cash - for - peerages inquiry .
The solicitor general , Mike O'Brien , said it would not be right for Lord Goldsmith to "" stand aside "" from any involvement in the case .
Lord Goldsmith recently made clear he would take decisions about whether the prime minister or any other members of his inner circle should face charges if he was required to do so following a request from the Crown Prosecution Service .
Labour 's Gordon Prentice ( Pendle ) said : "" Is n't it as plain as a pikestaff that there is a clear and obvious conflict of interest here and the attorney should remove himself from the process entirely ? ""
But Mr O'Brien insisted the issue was purely hypothetical at this stage and Lord Goldsmith had promised to appoint independent senior counsel to review all the relevant material if the CPS consulted him on such a prosecution .
Iraq and Middle East debate
The Commons will debate Iraq and the Middle East on Wednesday January 24 , Mr Straw announced .
He rejected calls for the prime minister to open the debate , which will instead be led by the foreign secretary , Margaret Beckett .
It will be held on a technical motion to adjourn the house limiting the opportunity for a vote .
Training of teachers to help special needs pupils The government was told by Labour 's Barry Sheerman ( Huddersfield ) , the education select committee chairman , there is "" something deeply wrong "" over the training of teachers to help special needs children .
He said : "" While there are many wonderful teachers in special educational needs up and down the country , there are not enough of them . ""
Junior education minister Parmjit Dhanda said special needs teaching was a compulsory part of teacher training .
He added : "" We need to go further and we are working with the Training and Development Agency on that
and I think the appropriate way forward is actually to work with groups like the autism working group . ""
BAA Airport operator BAA was accused by Mr Sheerman of incompetence and discrediting the travel industry .
He protested that the firm - which is now Spanish - owned - had no UK shareholders and therefore "" little accountability "" .
Mr Sheerman warned its "" monopoly "" over so many airports was having disastrous consequences for the travelling public .
Mr Straw said : "" I think we are all aware of the terrible conditions which were faced by travellers at Heathrow and other airports over the Christmas period . ""
He promised to alert the transport secretary , Alistair Darling , to MPs ' concerns .
Home Office
The Tories attacked "" recurring incompetence "" at the Home Office as rows over foreign criminals and escaped prisoners rumbled on .
They called for the Association of Chief Police Officers ' letter sent to Home Office minister Tony McNulty asking for more funds to deal with the criminal records backlog to be published "" immediately "" .
The shadow Commons leader , Theresa May , said she could see "" no sign of effective reform "" of the department under John Reid 's leadership .
Mr Straw said Mr Reid had been "" very open "" about the problems at the Home Office . ""
The moment this broke he came to the house and explained things . ""
Rural Payments Agency
The former head of the Rural Payments Agency was paid more than £ 80,000 after he was removed from office last year , rural affairs minister Barry Gardiner revealed .
Johnston McNeill continued being paid for more than eight months after his removal .
He was effectively suspended on full pay and cost taxpayers £ 81,410.55 from the time he was axed on March 16 until December 1 .
Funding for English language training Cuts in funding for English language training are "" at odds "" with government pronouncements on the need for migrants to learn the language , Labour 's John Grogan ( Selby ) said .
He warned they would "" effectively end "" free tuition for low - paid migrant workers and , for Tories , Boris Johnson protested that immigrants seeking to learn English and integrate in the UK were "" baffled "" at the cuts .
But education minister Bill Rammell said there needed to be a "" level playing field "" between people who came to the country and British citizens .
He said the current position was "" unsustainable "" and dismissed Mr Johnson 's argument as "" completely lacking in credibility "" .
Paedophile sentencing Labour 's Lindsay Hoyle ( Chorley ) renewed calls for a review of an appeal court decision to cut the sentence of a paedophile who filmed himself raping a schoolboy .
Mr Hoyle said the original sentence was too lenient and reducing it further had devastated the boy 's parents .
Mr Straw said the home secretary and the lord chancellor were looking at how to make the system more comprehensible to the public .
Inequality
The government and the opposition clashed over levels of inequality with Tories claiming Labour 's policy was having "" little impact "" on the problem .
Both parties cited figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies with Tory spokesman Oliver Heald arguing that Labour had not halted the rise in inequality of income .
Social exclusion minister Hilary Armstrong said the IFS called Labour 's record a "" remarkable achievement "" although she later conceded it also said inequality had been "" largely unchanged "" under Labour .
Quangos Mr Straw called for quangos to be made more accountable to parliament .
He was responding to Labour 's Geraldine Smith ( Morecambe and Lunesdale ) who said public concern was mounting over proliferation of quangos and their spending of "" huge "" amounts of taxpayers ' money .
He said : "" They have got to be very careful how they spend money and how they consult , before they do , with those who are elected . ""
Music teaching in schools
There is a "" postcode lottery "" when it comes to deprived schoolchildren getting the chance to learn to play a musical instrument , Labour 's Andrew Mackinlay ( Thurrock ) said .
He called on the education secretary , Alan Johnson , to "" get on with it "" and ensure children had the opportunity to learn classical musical instruments .
Mr Mackinlay compared the plight of working class children with those of well - heeled Esher in Surrey , indicating they were more likely to be able to play instruments at school .
Mr Johnson said he "" agreed entirely "" that music was important for deprived children .
The government was providing £ 30 m between 2006 and 2008 to help ensure "" that every primary child who wants to will have the opportunity to learn a musical instrument "" .
European constitution
The chances of "" fruitful "" talks on reviving the rejected European constitution were dismissed by the government as "" minimal "" .
Junior Foreign Office minister Lord Triesman was responding on the reported desire of the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , to revive the constitution during Germany 's current EU presidency .
World poverty
The government was accused of "" building up expectations "" of eliminating world poverty within the next few years .
Creating good government was a process that needed time and could not be rushed , said Liberal Democrat spokesman Lord Wallace of Saltaire .
Lords Leader Baroness Amos said : "" We have made good progress towards achieving a fairer world but there is a great deal more that we need to do .
We need to be realistic .
It is a global challenge and we all need to work together to meet it .
"" Artwork for the new Home Office HQ Works of art costing £ 55,260 have been commissioned for the new Home Office HQ , Minister Liam Byrne said .
Today in parliament Parliament is not sitting ."

Why Prince William may soon pop the question , says the headline over its website news story about the paparazzi haunting the prince 's girlfriend Kate Middleton .

2007-01-14,"Sir Christopher Meyer , the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission , has condemned the pursuit of Prince William 's girlfriend , Kate Middleton , by photographers as ' grotesque ' .
He applauded media organisations that have pledged not to use any pictures taken by the paparazzi , amid fears that the situation has increasing parallels with the attention given to William 's mother , Princess Diana . '
The scenes we saw around her flat just before she left for work at the end of last week were pretty grotesque and pretty horrible , ' Meyer told Radio 4 's Today programme yesterday ."
2007-01-14,"The story that Prince William is about to propose to his girlfriend , Kate Middleton , sent some of the country 's fiercest snappers on to London 's streets last week in search of the perfect pic .
For Middleton , who turned 25 last Tuesday , the prospect of life in front of the lens must be daunting .
The scrum outside her home led to a statement from William demanding the media respect her privacy , and prompted a surprising response from News International , which said it will no longer publish paparazzi shots of her .
The scenes of photographers pushing cameras into a young woman 's face recalled events involving Princess Diana a generation ago .
The fact that they took place days after the inquest into Diana 's death began serve as a stark reminder of press intrusiveness .
We asked some of Britain 's top PR experts what advice they would offer Middleton .
Gary Farrow
The Corporation
She should n't do anything yet .
The media is bigger now than it was when Diana was at her height : anyone who 's in the right place at the right time can make money from it now .
She needs to plan very carefully and seek professional advice .
First of all she should make it clear she is n't going to step into Diana 's shoes .
She will be self - elected by the media because that 's what they want ; she 's glamorous ,
she 's young
and she 's attractive .
James Herring Taylor
Herring
No interviews at all - not even one , or it 's open season .
Anything that looks like posing to the cameras and she 'll have nowhere to go .
She 's got to act like its business as usual as much as possible .
But if it looks like they 're heading down the aisle she should take a leaf out of Camilla 's book .
A series of well - managed set pieces which mark a tentative introduction to public life , but nothing that looks like an audition to be the next Queen .
If she wants any sanctuary from the media in the future her behaviour now is very important .
If she starts playing up to it , it 's going to be very hard to complain about her treatment and use the various regulatory bodies or the law .
Given that she 's got her whole life ahead of her she does n't need to be ticking the box marked ' publicity ' at this stage ; she should be hiring the publicity prevention unit .
She might feel like she 's got no privacy now
but that 's nothing compared with what will happen if there 's a public announcement [ about an engageement ] .
That 's when the gloves will come off .

She should have her own private council .
People in the family have turned to people on the QT for advice but sometimes the decisions are made for the benefit of the brand rather than for the benefit of the individual .
Do n't make the mistake of developing relationships [ with journalists ] , stay above it all and recognise that you 're public property .
She should choose her charitable activities and the organisations she gets involved with carefully , and be the antithesis of what Diana was .
You do n't want to create the Kate Middleton roadshow .
Max Clifford Max Clifford Associates
She needs professional help , professional guidance and professional protection .
The biggest part of PR these days is protection .
The whole thing last Tuesday was avoidable .
She did n't suddenly become 25 and anyone who knows anything about the media would know there would be a barrage of TV reporters and cameras waiting outside .
Did no one from the Palace know that ?
Either they are incompetent or they wanted to cause trouble .
They could have set up a photo shoot five minutes from her house and everyone would have got their picture .
You can work with the press rather than against them and it 's not too difficult to control .
Prince William was left alone when he was at university .

She needs to take advantage of the truce she 's been offered by the Sun , which places huge moral pressure on everyone else , keep smiling for the cameras and keep her head down .
Julian Henry Henry 's House
She 's someone who does n't need PR advice .
She 's played a blinder so far .
Her relationship with her boyfriend gives her an infrastructure , resources , experience and perspective .
I think she 's got a good profile .
People expect celebrities to disgrace themselves , and historically some royals have .
Some of the coverage has been quite nasty , implying that because she 's a 25-year - old girl she ca n't cope and she needs help .
It 's insulting and it 's bullshit .
If you 've grown up laughing at Big Brother and reading Heat you know how it works .
Lynne Franks PR guru
She 's handled it incredibly well .
She 's natural and she 's friendly .
She ca n't engage with the media - nor should she .
But she seems to have a very nice personality that comes across regardless .
We 've seen from Princess Diana that trying to manipulate the media is not a very clever thing to do .
William has asked the media to leave her alone and that will have an effect because it will elicit a certain amount of sympathy from the public and the editors .
Brian MacLaurin Brian MacLaurin Associates
My assessment is that a marriage or an engagement is miles away , if indeed it ever comes by at all .
The media could find itself playing a very long cat - and - mouse game with this young lady .
In the meantime she 's got to get on with her life , ignore it and start shutting down all her friends .
It becomes a very isolated life , but that 's what Sophie [ Wessex ] did .
She did n't know it was going to lead to an engagement either , but she became very secretive .
It 's not a nice life .
The media will try very hard to find her - I 've been reading about how much a picture of her in a bikini would be worth .
She should n't tell anyone anything , and should trust no one ."
2007-01-15,"Rain pattered on the white canopy over the entrance to Boujis , as gusts of wind ruffled the hairdos of the 30 or so ( mostly ) beautiful and rich young things waiting patiently behind the rope for a quiet nod from the head doorman , whose name , appropriately in the circumstances , was Paps .
It was fast approaching midnight and there was still no sign of Prince William and his girlfriend , Kate Middleton , who had turned 25 that day .
Club security staff , wearing dark woollen trench - coats and earpieces , were out in force .
One of the few paparazzi who had not given up the ghost yawned like a cat .
Another , listless and alone , glared at me suspiciously .
In this hall - of - mirrors media story - in which broadsheet hacks are dispatched to cover the excesses of paparazzi , who are in turn part of a media - inspired feeding frenzy feasting on a phantom royal engagement - the paps , under fire , trust no one .
Five nights earlier , Kate and William emerged from Boujis at 3 am to a barrage of flashbulbs and heckling snappers .
A police van disgorged officers to escort the couple through the baying mob to a waiting car , thereby averting what was deemed to be "" a potential public order problem "" .
But the images published the next morning helped stoke wild speculation that Kate was - after four years of being a royal squeeze - about to become Wills ' fiancee with the accompanying tax - payer - funded protection .
The following day 's headlines - "" Kate Cops An Escort "" ( the Sun ) , "" 12 Cops Help Wills have Kate night out ""
( Daily Star ) , "" A Ten - Police Guard for Kate as Engagement Rumours Grow "" ( Daily Mail ) - probably convinced the couple to stay away from their favourite haunt until the media storm blew itself out .
Boujis - thanks to Princes William and Harry , as well as a host of visiting A - List stars - has entered tabloid folklore , while retaining a thick cloak of mystery .
Nestled on Thurloe Street , South Kensington , the WAG and soap - star - free club is little more than a tiara 's toss from the French Lycée , the V&amp;A , Harrods and Sloane Avenue and , in the past six weeks alone , has played host to Paris Hilton , Lindsay Lohan and Jenson Button , as well as William and Kate .
According to one of the very few media figures allowed behind the Boujis rope , the club is popular with Princes William and Harry , and their set , because of its exclusivity and the fact that staff - and other club - goers - are "" ultra - discreet "" .
"" It 's very , very difficult to get in , "" says the regular .
"" The kind of people who go can walk home , if you see what I mean ?
Inside , it 's run very slickly with a core management of three , led by a good - looking blond guy called Jake , who happens to be [ photographer ]
Norman Parkinson 's grandson .
The doormen are ' on point ' and co - ordinate with each other with ear - pieces , not lumbering like apes in the doorway like they do in most clubs .
So the security is excellent , which really matters if you are hosting royalty . ""
But what 's really critical to William is that he is among his own at Boujis .
There are no hangers - on , no drug dealers , and definitely no paparazzi sneaking cameras in .
Famously , staff there will not tip off the tabloids about who 's inside .
They are obsessive about it .
Instead , photographers will have a long , cold wait outside .
The way [ the paps ] find out that William and Kate are there is because they are constantly cruising around a circuit of exclusive nightspots - including Boujis , Pangaea , Chinawhite and Umbaba - and they 'll stop when they recognise the cars and royal protection officers right outside .
Once one stops , they all do .
They are like sheep . ""
The past few weeks , culminating in the couple 's police escort from Boujis , have witnessed a huge escalation in paparazzi pursuit of Middleton , amid tabloid reports that the couple will soon announce their engagement - a story for which , according to one royal insider , "" not a shred of evidence exists "" .
MediaGuardian has also learned that the couple have twice been the victims of attempted hoaxes , in which people claiming to work for St James 's Palace contacted tabloid newspapers to convince them that an engagement ring was being ordered .
It is believed that a forged document purporting to show a ring which had been ordered in Prince William 's name was sent to the Sun , which smelt a rat .
Moreover , in a separate incident , a jeweller called palace officials to say that someone claiming to represent Prince William had phoned him to place an order for a ring .
Simultaneously , harassment of Middleton by paparazzi has gathered pace .
It began after she left St Andrews University , when she was frequently followed by a gaggle of photographers , who were tipped off by "" spotters "" placed at strategic locations , as she shopped in Chelsea .
However , the situation truly soured in 2005 , when a snatched shot of her sitting alone on a London bus was published in a handful of newspapers , which resulted in her lawyers writing to editors , as well as the Press Complaints Commission , to complain that the watchdog 's code had been breached .
Recently , tactics have become more menacing , with photographers keeping up a near 24-hour vigil outside her home and following her to work .
Cameras are regularly poked in her face and insults hurled at her in order to provoke a "" reaction shot "" .
It is also understood that the pursuit has become "" far more organised "" , with paps on motorbikes and in cars co - ordinating via mobile phones and ear - pieces .
In the past few days , for the first time , a van with blacked - out windows was used to track her .
News International 's announcement last week that it would no longer publish paparazzi pictures of Middleton has been welcomed by palace officials .
But the real test , they added , would come in a few months when the current fuss has died down .
Questions have also been raised about what exactly constitutes a "" paparazzi shot "" .
"" It 's not simply about who took the picture , "" says one senior source .
""
The Press Association [ news agency ] shots outside Kate 's flat were clearly paparazzi photographs because they were of someone going about their everyday life in the street , where they had a reasonable expectation of privacy and no permission had been granted .
"" On my late - night stakeout of the crowd outside Boujis , I counted four photographers in all by the club .
Two more had apparently just been spotted driving around the block .
I approached one . ""
Have you seen them go in ?
"" I asked .
He was an affable guy , who told me his name was Patrick and that he was a freelance .
"" We were waiting outside her flat all night , "" he replied .
"" They had a dinner party , but most of her friends have left now . ""
So she and William were still in her flat ?
"" We have n't seen her come out .
"" If she is at home , what was he doing outside Boujis ?
"" She might come here later ... "" he shrugged .
The next morning 's Sun reported that "" Wills was whisked from his new barracks in Windsor , Berks , for a meal in London with Kate Middleton .
The lovebirds then headed off to a posh club . ""
Well , if they did go to a club , on this occasion , it was not Boujis .
Indeed , inquiries reveal that , contrary to the Sun report , the couple apparently celebrated her birthday with "" a low - key evening with friends "" , thereby leaving the paparazzi , in every sense , out in the cold ."
2007-01-26,"News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman and his co - conspirator tapped into hundreds of phone messages of the royal family 's members of staff , the Old Bailey was told today during the sentencing hearing .
Goodman , 49 , and his co - conspirator , former Wimbledon footballer Glenn Mulcaire , 36 , are to be sentenced today after pleading guilty to intercepting phone messages , including some from Prince William .
The pair both face a maximum two - year prison sentence after pleading guilty to the charges in November .
David Perry QC , prosecuting , told the court today : "" The defendants ' motivation was profit and personal gain and their conduct amounted to gross invasion of privacy and the abuse of the public telephone system . ""
Asked by the judge , Mr Justice Gross , how many messages had been intercepted , Mr Perry replied : "" Several hundred in total . ""
Mulcaire pleaded guilty to five charges of intercepting phone messages . ""
The inference to be drawn is that he was also motivated by profit , seeking confidential information with a view to selling it to the press , "" said Mr Perry .
He said the two men had used mobile numbers and secret codes used by mobile phone network operators to break into the voicemails .
The duo made 609 calls to the royal staff members ' numbers .
Of those , 487 were made by Goodman and 122 made by Mulcaire . ·

2007-01-26,"After a massive publicity campaign - those adverts of chundering party goers romping on their parent 's bed with a teddy bear were on high rotation - the new teen drama Skins premiered last night on E4 .
The series about the lives of a group of Bristol teenagers featuring the hot one , the geeky one , the anorexic one etc etc is E4 's big local hope for the year and while the adverts looked fab , critical opinion seemed pretty underwhelming , to be honest .
Lucy Mangan in the Guardian was wryly amused by it : "" But if this is designed to emphasise how truly realistic Tony et al are , the effect has been slightly muted by the decision to cast as the college lot , actors who could give Prince William elocution lessons ...
They are as irritating as real teenagers , I 'll give them that . ""
Ian Johns in the Times was more positive than most : "" The script was good at capturing that mix of wanton self absorption and vulnerability that makes parents want to wring their kids ' necks and hug them at the same time ...
The series ' primary aim is to entertain rather than raise issues with a helpline number at the end .
More importantly it shows heart rather than a blanket "" whatever ! ""
cynicism that makes it worth watching for the Space Invaders generation as well as the MySpacers . ""
Patricia Wynn Davies in the Daily Telegraph found some flaws : "" I 'm sad to say that with its patchy storytelling and humour , it 's not exactly up there with that other recent televised tale of teens and their flawed mums and dads ( also from the Shameless stable ) , Jonathan Coe 's Seventies - set The Rotter 's Club .
Pretty boy Tony , geeky virginal Sid , dotty anorexic Cassie and some of the lesser characters too , seemed like real Noughties teenagers and that 's an achievement . ""
Geoff Ellis in the Radio Times liked it , kind of : "" It 's engaging in a fast moving , episodic way , provided that you can accept that adults are figures of fun , but be warned - this new nine - parter boasts all the self - restraint you 'd expect from the makers of Shameless .
But the punters voted decisively with their remote controls .
News just in from the ratings desk is that the series ' debut pulled in a whopping 1.4 million to E4 last night .
But will you be back for the second episode ?"
2007-02-02,"Crude oil is still polluting Alaskan waters almost 18 years after the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground , according to a study by US government scientists to be published in two weeks .
The study , an advance of which was released on Wednesday , found more than 26,600 gallons of oil remaining at Prince William Sound .
Researchers say it is declining at a rate of only 4 % a year and even slower in the Gulf of Alaska .
The disclosure came as Exxon Mobil posted the largest annual profit by a US company , $ 39.5bn ( £ 20bn ) yesterday .
Predictions that the pollution would have disappeared by now have proved to be inaccurate , and the damaged ecosystem is struggling to recover .
The lingering oil , lying below the surface , affects wildlife and the general environment , and "" degrades the wilderness character "" of protected lands , the report says .
The study , by experts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , is to be published in the Environmental Science and Technology journal .
The scientists conclude : "" Such persistence can pose a contact hazard to inter - tidally foraging sea otters , sea ducks , and shore birds , create a chronic source of low - level contamination , discourage subsistence in a region where use is heavy , and degrade the wilderness character of protected lands . ""
The oil spill in 1989 , the worst single incident of pollution in US history , covered 1,200 miles of pristine shoreline .
The slow rate of dispersal means the oil could persist for decades more below the surface near some beaches .
Mark Boudreaux , a spokesman for Exxon Mobil said yesterday the company would review the findings . ""
Based on our initial review of the report , there is nothing newsworthy or significant in the report that has not already been addressed , "" he said .
"" The existence of some small amounts of residual oil in Prince William Sound on about two - tenths of 1 % of the shore of the sound is not a surprise , is not disputed and was fully anticipated . ""
Mr Boudreaux said Exxon has supported more than 350 independent studies whose scientists have found no evidence of significant long - term impact ."

Edwards added that he had talked to the Prince about his love for Ms Middleton , giving evidence to the Commons culture , media and sport select committee for its investigation of media invasion of privacy .
"" She is a private citizen and she is in love with Prince William and I am sure that one day they will get married , I have talked to him about this , "" he said .

2007-03-07,"Senior newspaper executives yesterday defended the principle of self - regulation of the press , insisting that phone tapping and "" fishing expeditions "" that flouted privacy laws were not commonplace despite a series of high profile incidents .

2007-03-15,"About five years ago , there was much tabloid excitement at rumours of a budding email romance between Prince William , who was in those days a rather handsome young man with a lovely head of blond hair , and Britney Spears , who was in those days a phenomenally successful young popstrel with equally lovely blond locks .
What a difference a few years have made .
Britney is bald ; William not far behind .
And instead of being accompanied by a miniskirted pin - up , the heir to the throne has by his side a girl in longer - length tweed .
It 's a funny old world .
The photographs of William and Kate at Cheltenham serve to back up two of my most unshakeable sartorial prejudices : first , that calf - length skirts should be banned by law ; and second , that posh people should never wear sunglasses because they always get them horribly wrong .
They are also an undoubted setback in the royal family 's long - running campaign to update their public image .
William is 24 ; Kate is 25 .
Normal people their age do not wear tweed hacking jackets or buttoned - up longer - length skirt suits on fun days out .
Fact .
William has never been exactly fashion forward , but he now seems positively fashion - backward .
You ca n't wear a shirt and tie and jumper and jacket : the jumper kills dead all the muscularity of the suit and tie , while the suit and tie kill the casualness of the jumper , so you end up looking stuffy and emasculated .
Who should take the blame for Kate 's look ?
By all accounts she has , despite the much - publicised flirtation with Topshop , long had tendencies towards lamb - dressed - as - mutton .
Last year she wore a tailored tweed coat by
Fulham designer Katherine Hooker to Cheltenham - livened up on that occasion by a controversial mink hat - so fingers are likely to point in that direction .
More intriguing is the evident influence of Camilla .
Kate 's matronly dog - walking tweeds and unreconstructed - Sloane shirt collar are more in keeping with the wardrobe of Charles 's current wife than that of the glamourpuss William 's mother had become by the time of her death .
Perhaps the publicity - shy Kate has found a smart way of avoiding becoming the new Diana - by becoming the new Camilla instead ."
2007-03-24,"Police are to be given powers to seize trespassers at 16 sites ranging from royal palaces to the official residences of politicians , it was announced yesterday .
At present officers are not allowed to arrest a trespasser as long as they agree to be escorted from the site , even if they refuse to give their names or say why they are there .
But after several high - profile intrusions - notably the gatecrashing of Prince William 's 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle by a comedian dressed as Osama bin Laden - and the increased threat from terrorism , new laws have been brought in to give police more powers at designated "" protected sites "" .
If someone trespasses on the designated sites they risk being jailed for up to six months and fined up to £ 5,000 .
So far places designated have been military bases and nuclear power stations .
But yesterday the Home Office announced a new list of sites that , unless MPs raise objections , will be designated from June .
As well as Windsor Castle , Buckingham Palace , scene of a protest by Fathers 4 Justice in 2004 , will be afforded the extra protection .
Sandringham , the Queen 's country retreat , and Prince Charles ' home at Highgrove in Gloucestershire are also on the list .
The Palace of Westminster , another target of Fathers 4 Justice , is included as are 10 , 11 and 12 Downing Street , the last of which now houses the prime minister 's press office .
The PM 's country retreat , Chequers in Buckinghamshire , is also being designated .
The Ministry of Defence and the headquarters of MI5 and MI6 feature , as do government electronic listening posts .
The Home Office will ask sites that are protected to make sure there are clear signs setting out where people can go .
The new offence of trespass on a protected site was suggested in 2003 after the "" comedy terrorist "" Aaron Barschak got into Windsor Castle .
The suggestion was supported by another report the following year after tabloid reporter Ryan Parry got a job as a royal footman and claimed he got close enough to the Queen to be able to poison her .
Police could then not arrest a person simply for crossing the threshold of a royal palace or politician 's country retreat if they had committed no other offence and agreed to be escorted off the premises .
The new law , introduced in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 and amended by the Terrorism Act 2006 , was designed to close this loophole and act as a deterrent to publicity stunts .
Human rights groups fear the powers could hinder peaceful protest .
On the list Among the key sites : Buckingham Palace , London St James 's Palace , London Windsor Castle , Berkshire Sandringham House , Norfolk Highgrove House , Gloucestershire Palace of Westminster and Portcullis House , London 10 , 11 , 12 Downing Street , London 70 Whitehall ( Cabinet Office ) Chequers , Buckinghamshire Ministry of Defence , Whitehall Government Communication Headquarters ( GCHQ ) , Cheltenham"
2007-03-27,"When the Sun printed a photograph of Prince William groping the breast of a Brazilian student in a Bournemouth nightclub , eerily similar to a snap of Prince Harry doing the same in 2003 , it illustrated a long - standing irony : while the royals are occasionally moved to reach out , they do n't much like being touched themselves .
Australian PM Paul Keating earned the nickname Lizard of Oz for daring to put his hand on the Queen in 1992 .
His successor John Howard was accused of the same thing in 2000 .
Tony Blair made Her Majesty visibly uncomfortable when he forced her to hold his hand on Millennium Eve , and there was a minor furore when Prince Charles met the Spice Girls at an awards ceremony in 1997 and Geri Halliwell pinched his bum .
This is , of course , just another example of the hypocrisy upon which royalty is based .
So which of the royals can you touch ?
For the uninitiated , a primer : The Queen Do not touch under any circumstances - simply bow or curtsey .
If you notice that she has some food stuck to her chin , then you should put some food in the same spot on your chin , and carry on as normal .
If she has a wasp near her , you may shoo it away with the glove - on - a - pole provided by members of her household .
The Duke of Edinburgh
Although the rules regarding contact with the Royal Consort are much less strict , as a rule you should n't touch Prince Philip , because it might be one of the days when they use the wax one , and you might knock it over .
If the Duke touches you in any way , just pretend it has n't happened until you can get some kind of counselling .
Prince Charles
If he puts out his hand , you may shake it .
Commoners and staff alike should avoid touching Charles under other circumstances , even when you are brushing his teeth for him .
William and Harry
If they offer a hand , you may lightly place your breast in it , but only if you are a lady .
Photographers should never touch the princes , and in particular must watch out for Harry 's amusing habit of waving his fists about as he leaves a nightclub , which can lead to an accidental breach of protocol .
Under certain circumstances it is acceptable to clasp Harry under the arms , provided you are helping him out of the gutter and into a waiting 4X4 ."

In a statement , the PCC said it had been informed by Ms Middleton that the matter was settled by the Daily Mirror 's "" prompt public expression of regret and admission of error "" .
The PCC had begun a formal investigation after the complaint last Friday that a photograph taken of Ms Middleton on her way to work last week had been obtained as a result of harassment .
The PCC reminded editors that they should refrain from publishing pictures taken when the subject had asked them to stop photographing when there is "" no obvious public interest for persisting "" .
"" Kate Middleton has made repeatedly clear to the press - through the commission , to photographers , and to editors directly - that she objects to being followed by photographers when she is on her own going about her daily business and there is no specific public interest reason for following her , "" said the statement .
It said formal complaints about harassment are rare .
The Daily Mirror apologised for the photograph last Friday , the same day the complaint was made .
The editor , Richard Wallace , admitted that the paper had "" got it wrong "" .
He said the newspaper had used an "" innocuous picture "" from a freelance photographer taken in circumstances where they were later told she felt harassed .
"" We welcome Ms Middleton 's decision , "" Mr Wallace said today .

2007-04-14,"Prince William and his long - term girlfriend Kate Middleton have parted , it was confirmed today .
The couple , who met at St Andrews University , have reached an ' amicable agreement ' to end their relationship , and a source confirmed the 24-year - old second - in - line to the throne and 25-year - old Kate had gone their separate ways .
The split was said to be caused by the huge pressures on the young couple and because of the time William has devoted to Army life .
Clarence House refused to comment , with a spokesman for the Prince saying : ' We do n't comment on Prince William 's private life . '
The couple were widely tipped to one day tie the knot , with speculation mounting after Kate attended William 's graduation parade at Sandhurst in December .
It was the first time she had attended such a high profile event where the Queen and other senior members of the family were present .
Dating a future King saw Miss Middleton propelled into the spotlight .
She faced a barrage of press outside her home on her birthday in January and recently lodged a complaint with the Press Complaint Commission over alleged harassment , which she later settled .
A psychologist pointed to the intense strain the pair would have suffered from constant public scrutiny . '
The pressure they were under must have been horrible , ' said Dr Linda Papadopoulos .
' They 've been scrutinised constantly , comments made , editorials written about a relationship they themselves are probably trying to figure out . '
Veteran royal watchers said that news of the break - up had taken them by surprise and many said the constant media attention was probably not the main factor in the split , suggesting that the relationship had simply run its course .
Judy Wade , royal correspondent for Hello ! magazine , said she was ' absolutely shocked ' at the separation . '
So recently we 've seen them looking so happy together at the rugby and at Cheltenham . '
She said Kate 's parent 's would probably be most disappointed by the young couple 's decision to go their separate ways . '
I do n't particularly blame the harassment of the press , she said .
' I think Kate 's been living in limbo , neither Royal nor commoner any longer .
It 's been very difficult for her . '
With news of their split , royal fans ' hopes for a William and Kate wedding have been dashed ."

April 14 , 2007 :
William and Kate are confirmed to have split ."
2007-04-15,"The claim by Gordon Brown , in Saturday 's interview with this newspaper , that we in Britain have "" fallen out of love with celebrity "" shows that the prime minister - in - waiting is way out of touch with the popular culture of his times .
If Brown were right , he should have had someone from his office get in touch with Prince William and his former girlfriend Kate Middleton and tell them the good news -
hey guys , you do n't have to split up .
The public are no longer interested in celebrity !
But Gordon Brown should n't feel too bad about getting it hopelessly wrong .
For he belongs to a group of illustrious pundits , pop stars and professional zeitgeist watchers who have , since the 1990s , all predicted the end of celebrity culture - and they 've all been wrong .
I should know , I was one of the first to make this mistake in 1995 when I wrote about the rise of "" celebrity fatigue "" .
But then so did public - relations supremo Matthew Freud , when he said : "" I think the media cycle is such that now , with very few exceptions , the famous are no longer interesting . ""
Celebrity culture survived and got even bigger with the success of Big Brother and the rise of reality TV .
And then along came the terrorist attack of 9/11 and American journalists
were once again convinced that celebrity was over .
Trivia was set to give way to a "" new seriousness "" .
Again , they were wrong .
So why , despite failed prediction after failed prediction , do public figures still pop up and claim the end is nigh for celebrity culture ?
The simple answer is that we want to believe it 's true .
For many people celebrity culture has , since 2000 , become public enemy
No 1 :
the pre - eminent symbol of the trivialisation of public life and the dumbing down of the nation 's cultural values .
Critics of celebrity culture like to claim that they see a new seriousness on the horizon .
They take comfort in the large numbers attending literary festivals and public debates .
That may be true , but their rise does n't mean celebrity 's fall .
It means that there 's a growing audience for festivals and debates .
Now here 's the bad news .
The end of celebrity culture is n't going to happen for reasons that have to do with the nature of modern life and aspirations .
The first one is very hard for these critics to grasp : people actually like this stuff !
They enjoy reading about Kylie , Liz , Robbie and Jordan .
There are many sane and decent people who think that the life of former Atomic Kitten singer Kerry Katona is not only enviable and glamorous , but fascinating .
She is the Virginia Woolf of the Heat generation .
When critics of celebrity culture shake their heads and complain that these dreadful people have "" no talent "" they 're missing the point ; they are liked because they do n't have talent !
They offer human forms of entertainment .
People do n't care about their singing - they want the life , their story of triumph and sorrow .
Those who , like Gordon Brown , claim that these people are "" only famous for being famous "" , are simply uttering a cliched tautology .
In fact , they 're famous because they represent things that are at the very heart of modern consumer capitalism : social mobility , fashion , the body , sex , and the need for affirmation .
It was Susan Sontag who said that being a dandy was a way of being an individual in an age of mass culture .
The problem today is how to be an individual in an age of mass individualism , when the usual means of status - clothes , cars , consumer goods - are within the grasp of a majority of the population , at least in the west .
The answer is : celebrity .
You want celebrity culture to die ?
Kill capitalism first
and then we 'll talk .

2007-04-16,"When I decided to take my friend to the west London nightclub Mahiki last Friday night , I had no idea it was a favourite hangout of Prince William .
I certainly did n't know he 'd be there that evening , fresh from his break - up with Kate Middleton .
Mahiki is a friendly place with great , Polynesian - themed decor and a mixed crowd of almost every nationality .
But after paying £ 10 to get in we were shocked to find that you need to spend £ 1,000 to sit at some of the tables .
In the end we found a comfortable couch on the lower floor , just near the entrance .
We had a few drinks and then popped upstairs to have a look round .
When we came back downstairs , our comfy sofa had been taken by a bunch of blokes .
Our heels were killing us , so we just said , "" Excuse us "" , but they were already moving on to a table .
It was dark , so it was only then I noticed one of them looked a bit familiar - Prince William .
He was smiling a lot , rocking his head to the music and ordering a lot of drinks : £ 125 cocktails such as the Treasure Chest , which a group of friends share out of a wooden box .
At one point , a large crowd of young girls descended on his table and every one of them tried to give him a "" hello "" hug .
They were flirting outrageously , but he just moved to another table .
Eventually , the club security closed off the whole section .
We just carried on sipping drinks , and popped to the dance floor and back without any problems .
Around 2 am we were back in our seats when William came over to chat to someone standing nearby .
He had his back to us , with his bum almost at eye level .
For a joke , my friend gave him a tap on the rear - as if to say , "" Can you give us some space ? ""
One of his friends gave him a tap too .
He did n't seem to mind , and even gave us a playful smile .
He seemed like an ordinary guy , just someone in his mid-20s letting his hair down and having a laugh ."
2007-04-16,"The ex - couple in February 2007
Alastair Grant / AP Of the broadsheets , only the Telegraph and the Guardian believe that the break - up of two former university sweethearts whose relationship struggled in the outside world merits a mention on the front page , and then only briefly .
Things , however , are different in the tabloids .
With no official explanation of the why s , where s and how s of it all from either Prince William or his former girlfriend Kate Middleton , there 's no lack of theories .
As in the case of Faye Turney , one of the 15 sailors captured and released by Iran , the tabloid treatment of Ms Middleton varies between the Sun , which got the scoop , and the others , which did n't .
To the Mirror , Ms Middleton is "" heartbroken "" and was dumped "" in a dramatic phone call "" from Prince William while at work .
A colleague tells the paper that she left without saying a word after receiving a difficult call .
"" We did n't think anything about it at the time , but looking back the call was definitely boyfriend - girlfriend tiff , "" the colleague says .
The Mail says the split came after Prince William "" was dallying with at least two other society beauties "" , and followed Ms Middleton 's "" devastation that an expected announcement of their engagement never came in February "" .
The Sun describes Ms Middleton as "" stunning "" , "" caring "" and "" motherly "" , and believes the crunch time came during a recent skiing holiday . ""
By splitting with her now , William has protected his first real girlfriend from months , if not years , of high profile problems , "" the paper says , without pointing any fingers .
The papers are already compiling lists of the next lucky Queen in waiting - all twentysomethings , some with triple - barrelled surnames - while simultaneously asking whether the prince will come to regret the break - up .
But there 's relief at Woolworths , the Guardian says .
Although designs for commemorative wedding souvenirs including teatowels , mouse mats , mugs , plates and mobile phones had been drawn up , they had not been put into production .
Amid suggestions that there was a royal summit to decide the future of the relationship , the Times looks to history - specifically the Royal Marriages Act of 1772 , which gives the current monarch the right to veto royal family marriage plans .
"" Not that this has made for smoother royal relationships , "" it says .
"" For most of the past 250 years , the rules of the game in royal romances - at least for princes - have been ( 1 ) start off with actresses , ( 2 ) marry foreigners . ""
The Independent has a two - page warts and all spread on "" the split that shocked the nation "" .
"" There 's no escape for the woman who nearly became queen , "" the paper reports , referring - of course - to Isabel Sartious ' ill - fated relationship with Prince Felipe of Spain 20 years ago .

2007-04-16,"Tony Blair yesterday called for the media to leave Prince William and his former girlfriend Kate Middleton alone , following the highly public ending of their four - year relationship .
As Ms Middleton , 25 , spent the weekend privately with her parents at home in the village of Bucklebury , Berkshire , the prince , second in line to the throne , returned to his regiment in Dorset , after a Friday - night visit to a London nightclub .
The prime minister said on the BBC 's Politics Show yesterday : "" I think in respect of Prince William , they are a young couple .
We have had the announcement , fine .
They should be left alone now , without reams of stuff being written - that I can assure you , from my experience of royal stories , most of which will be complete nonsense .
I think , now it has been announced , they should be allowed to get on with their lives .
"" The couple 's decision to split was said in weekend reports to have followed discussions before Easter with senior members of the royal family .
Ms Middleton and the prince met as students at St Andrews in 2001 and later shared a student house , but had been seen together in public much less frequently in recent weeks .
Ms Middleton , the daughter of Michael and Carole Middleton , who have a company supplying accessories for children 's parties , had been regarded as an eligible , level - headed potential partner for the prince , even though she did not come from a royal or aristocratic background .
Yesterday there were reports that her mother in particular had been looked down on by some members of William 's circle of friends .
Last month , Ms Middleton complained for the first time to the Press Complaints Commission of harassment by photographers as she left her flat in Chelsea , and the editor of the Daily Mirror apologised after his paper published a photograph of her .
The Metropolitan police would not comment on whether Ms Middleton would now be given special protection .
It was unclear , too , whether the car that she had on lease for publicity purposes would be withdrawn .
Woolworths announced , with relief , that while its designs for commemorative wedding souvenirs , including tea towels , mouse mats , mugs , plates and mobile phones had been drawn up , they had not been put into production .
The likelihood of a wedding had at one stage been quoted by bookmakers at 3 - 1 .
Clarence House declined to comment on reports that the prince 's grandfather had told him to marry , or end the relationship .
In an interview three years ago he said : "" I am too young to marry at my age .
I do n't want to get married until I am at least 28 or maybe 30 . ""
The publicist Max Clifford said : "" Everybody is trying to find out why it happened .
Her friends will be approached by everybody , asking : how does she feel , what 's gone on and what do you know ?
And it will be the same for her and everybody
she is seen with .
The next boyfriend will get a massive amount of attention .
"" Of course , everybody is going to speculate who 's the next one going to be ; it 's an opportunity for massive media coverage .
She would never do it -
I am sure she would n't even dream of doing it , but she 's in that position of being the hottest kiss - and - tell property in history .
I 've already had contacts from various national newspapers saying if she comes to you , tell us . """
2007-04-16,"She is , the newspapers claim , "" pushy , rather twee and incredibly middle class "" .
At Prince William 's Sandhurst passing - out parade , she chewed gum .
When she first met the Queen , according to unnamed sources sharing their prejudices with the press , she disastrously uttered the greeting "" Pleased to meet you "" instead of "" Hello , Ma'am "" .
Worse still , her vocabulary is alleged to include the dread word "" toilet "" , and if she has n't quite heard what you have said , she will invite no end of derision by saying "" Pardon "" .
In that part of British society that will for ever be built around strange vowel sounds , shooting animals , green clothes and endless luxury , there was really no hope for her .
In the hurricane of speculation and gossip that has followed this year 's Great Royal Break - Up , the voices quoted , keen to find a ( preferably female ) scapegoat , have returned again and again to Carole Middleton : mother of Kate , resident of Bucklebury in Berkshire , ex - flight attendant , and alleged "" ferocious social climber "" .
According to one "" royal source "" who spoke to the Mail on Sunday , "" The Queen was fond of Kate and liked her father , but let 's just say there was a feeling that Mrs Middleton was not right or acceptable . ""
Yesterday 's papers told stories of blue - blooded pals of the prince making references to Mrs Middleton 's former career by wittily whispering "" doors to manual "" whenever her daughter was out of earshot .
Carole Middleton 's supposed role in the Wills'n'Kate saga puts her somewhere between Henry Higgins in Pygmalion , Mrs Bennet from Pride and Prejudice and the titular anti - heroine of Noël Coward 's song Mrs Worthington .
Leaving aside slightly fantastical reports about mother and daughter cooking up a marry - the - future - king plot while Kate was in her early teens , Mrs Middleton was apparently thrilled at the couple 's initial courtship and anxious to do whatever she could to further its progress .
She is said , by papers keen to portray her as the pushy mother , to have "" urged her daughter to take riding lessons and advised her to keep her fashion style modest and far from edgy "" .
She allegedly pushed Kate to take a relatively lowly job as a children 's accessories buyer for the Jigsaw clothing chain , so as to allow her the flexibility that a royal paramour will always require .
All the while , she saw to the running of Party Pieces , the self - styled "" leading UK children 's party supplier "" - which once paid for Kate 's school fees and seems to represent a quintessentially nouveau - riche dream somewhere between Thatcherite entrepreneurship and an episode of Relocation Relocation , proudly claiming to have its own call centre "" in a 200-year - old barn "" .
And now ?
Her dreams are dust , proof that - as yet another "" insider "" put it - "" There are some social mountains you just ca n't scale .
You ca n't become royal through sheer force of will . ""
The same "" source "" went on : "" Carole 's approach is very aspirational .
But re - laying your drive and trimming the wisteria around your front door is n't going to make your home , or your daughter , fit for a prince .
"" Somewhere in all this , there lurks a very modern cautionary tale .
The Daily Mail praises "" middle - class values "" as if they were the very acme of British achievement .
The mission of New Labour , we were told at the last election , was "" to allow more people to join the middle class "" .
Tony Parsons , a paragon of the increasingly rare jump from proletariat to bourgeoisie , once saluted the latter as follows : "" They are the most cultured class , [ and ] the hardest working .
They believe in the welfare state but are aware of its corrupting nature ...
There are many things to despise about the middle class , but unlike the nobs and the riff - raff , they do not know their place .
They believe in self - improvement . ""
Work hard , invest wisely , and it could all be yours : weekly trips to Waitrose , sojourns in southern Europe , and a confident approach to the average wine list .
Should you wish , you may even wish to firm up your children 's life chances by sending them to an expensive school , where they may just be lucky enough mix with the sons and daughters of privilege .
But here 's the interesting thing : even if being middle class represents modern Britain 's social ideal , at the upper end of the class system there still lies one of the most reinforced glass ceilings that humankind has ever managed to build .
Here , those self - same middle - class values may well turn into a disadvantage , class will harden into caste - and , faced by a mass of subtle gradations and intricate etiquette , the social elevator will often grind to a halt .
If the stories about Kate and Carole Middleton are true , then anyone who tries to move stands a very good chance of being kicked back down again .
In France , of course , they thrashed a good deal of this out at the end of the 18th century ; here , for better or worse , the tensions go on .
The alleged fate of the Middletons is not the only example .
Of late , the clash between middle and upper classes has surely been played out whenever the Windsors have bumped up against the Blairs .
Strip the plotline of the award - winning film The Queen down to its basics , and there it is : the Prime Minister 's bourgeois touchy - feeliness colliding with a world that wants nothing to do with it .
( In which sense , the fact that the film pits swinging London against stuffy old Balmoral is perfect ) .
For a real - life crystallisation of the same story , think back to that footage of the Queen and Prince Philip refusing to cross their arms and join in Auld Lang Syne with nearly as much gusto as Cherie and Tony Blair .
When I speak to Peter York , the journalist , broadcaster and author of The Official Sloane Ranger Handbook , he spends 20 minutes guiding me through the nuanced minefield that these days surrounds the distinction between middle and upper class , partly traceable to the fact that people from the latter "" mix with other people far more than they used to - they go into occupations where being conspicuously toff is a disadvantage "" .
He claims that the tell - tale words once grouped into the categories of "" U "" and "" non - U "" - by Nancy Mitford , whose 1956 essay Noblesse Oblige lurked in the background of the weekend 's stories - are losing their charge , though that hardly heralds the arrival of any kind of classlessness . ""
These things are not nearly as clear - cut as they used to be , "" he says .
"" And they 're very much mediated by generation .
If people 's parents and grandparents are possible arbiters of whether someone gets married or not , they really care about these things , even if the young people themselves might not .
But they 've been absolutely drummed into people over 35 : things like saying ' toilet ' , and saying ' pardon ? '
instead of ' what ? ' .
To them , things like that are like chalk on a blackboard . ""
The younger upper - crust , he explains , are not quite as doctrinaire .
Their vetting procedures are altogether more subtle , though that arguably makes them even more difficult to navigate . ""
To them , it 's all about taste , "" he says .
So it 's all about shopping . ""
Clothes , housing , cars - there are all sorts of things that will have that blackboard- scraping quality .
"" The adjective he uses here is "" charlie "" - as in "" a proper charlie "" - intended to denote anything seen as "" naff , unsophisticated or low - rent "" . ""
Imagine if both the Beckhams turned up , wanting one of their boys to marry into a smart family , "" he says .
"" On one hand , the people they were introducing themselves to would love their money , in the way that the upper class have always loved the money of American heiresses .
But at the same time , the way they looked would just scrape : over - fashiony , overdone hair , over - made up ... just over , over , over . ""
When I mention the tales about Carole Middleton , there is a sharp intake of breath .
"" I 'm a bit taken aback about the idea of chewing gum at a royal occasion , I have to say .
If it 's true , some sort of danger signal should have told her that was n't a brilliant thing to do .
Historically , chewing gum has great symbolism and baggage .
It 's lower - class teenage rebellion .
It 's sort of , ' Oo - er .
She could be a loose cannon . '
"" I also put in a call to Mary Killen , author of the Spectator 's rib - tickling etiquette column ( sample letter : "" My new car is a Volkswagen golf .
I understand that there is a class shibboleth about the pronunciation of the word ' golf ' , and that , as far as the game is concerned , it is considered infra dig ( ie , beneath one 's dignity ) to pronounce the ' l ' .
Does the same apply to a vehicle ? "" ) .
As well as dispensing weekly advice to those would - be Middletons anxious about how to behave in rarefied places , Killen lives close to the upscale Wiltshire town of Marlborough , where Kate Middleton went to school .
She begins by giving me a quick guide to the current state of aristocratic manners .
"" I know that quite a few upper - class people say ' toilet ' now , but as a joke , "" she says .
"" And did you know that the word ' meal ' is meant to be very common ?
You should always say ' lunch ' , ' dinner ' or ' breakfast ' .
And there are very small , subtle distinguishing factors , like never reading a novel in a drawing room .
If you read a coffee - table book , that 's fine , because everyone knows it 's a short - attention - span thing .
But a novel makes you unavailable . ""
She goes on : "" I know people who think tomatoes are common ; they wo n't have a tomato in the house .
Another indicator is marmalade .
Thin , runny , hand - made marmalade is a sign of being upper class , whereas firm , gelatinous marmalade is common .
Why ?
It 's just one of those things .
Upper - class people make their own marmalade , and they tend to prefer it runny , probably because they 've got lots of people to clear up the mess . ""
When it comes to the stories about Carole Middleton 's alleged failure to gel with the Windsors , she says she is sceptical .
"" At least two of the Middleton children went to Marlborough , so I think she 'd have picked up the fact that you do n't say ' pardon ' and ' toilet ' .
And apart from anything else , I 'd have actually thought that the royals would have liked to marry down . ""
Then she throws me something of a curve .
"" They 're the most un - snobbish of anyone in the country , the royals , "" she claims .
"" Unlike the old French nobility , they think that invigorating blood is necessary .
I think they 'd have probably welcomed some hard - working stock . ""
To be fair , those who would have you believe that the House of Windsor does occasionally welcome self - made upstarts into its gene pool have one recent example on their side : Sophie Rhys - Jones , now known as the Countess of Wessex , whose father Christopher was a tyre salesman .
That said , when it comes to the next king , some of the more speculative responses to the Wills'n'Kate break - up have suggested that the royals will always tend to put genetic imperatives behind mixing with the right sort of people .
Yesterday , for example , the Daily Mail claimed that , socially speaking , Prince William had already started to look back up , "" dallying with two society beauties as Kate Middleton battled to save their four - year romance "" .
Accompanying the story was a picture of the ex - queen - to - be , demonstrating her return to earth by carrying a box marked "" Spar onion rings "" .
Meanwhile , those poor souls who earn a living from forecasting the path of royal romances began looking at Prince William 's possible future girlfriends .
They included Rosie Ruck - Keene ( "" The pair danced at Mihiki , but were with her boyfriend , William van Cutsem "" ) , a "" popular member of William 's polo set "" called Davina Duckworth - Chad , and Lady Rosanagh Innes - Ker , the daughter of the Duke of Roxburghe .
In the Sun , by far the biggest coverage was given to one Isabella Anstruther - Gough - Calthorpe , who the coverage reckoned was "" no shrinking violet "" .
"" She was the first cover girl of posh Country Life magazine to appear with a belly - button ring , "" it said .
"" A party girl , Isabella is often spotted at Boujis nightclub in London 's swanky South Kensington , a favourite with the prince and his pals . ""
Normal royal service , it seemed , had been resumed ."

2007-04-16,"Did my ears deceive me or did Radio 4 lead its news bulletins from dawn to dusk on Saturday with the news that Prince William has broken up with Kate Middleton , the serious girlfriend of his student years ?
I realise why the tabloids get overexcited about this stuff and strongly endorse the proposition that the posher end of the BBC and broadsheet market should not loftily ignore it altogether , as they might once have done .
But to lead the bulletins on Radio 4 with ten minutes of upmarket tittle - tattle ?
Surely not .
The Guardian 's royal watcher , Stephen Bates , sums up the gossip in this morning 's paper in about 250 words , the equivalent of 90 seconds of air - time .
The World at One treated it like war with Iran , deploring intrusive media attention as if it was n't part of the problem too .
There are several issues here .
Lieutenant Wales is second in line to the throne , so who he marries is a matter of legitimate public interest as well as , something quite different , being interesting to much of the public .
Personally , I doubt if Will ' n ' Kate are the hot topic of dinner table conversation ' ' from Buenos Aires to Manila '' as one overheated scribe wrote in the Sunday papers .
That 's just ethno - centric fantasy plus a few premature engagement coffee mugs to unload .
But some people love the royal soap and the prince 's mother was certainly a global celebrity .
What exactly happened between the former love birds we do n't know .
Not even Max Clifford , publicist to the rough trade , knows yet .
The Daily Mail , usually shrewder than most in these matters , reports today that Ms Middleton 's assertive decision to join the royal party at Cheltenham on Gold Cup day - when he was back at his army base and had asked her not to - was a critical moment in his cooling off .
But the lad is only 24 - at 25 she 's the older woman - and student romances survive the post - student world and endure relatively rarely .
He 's got a proper job now and must be acutely aware of mum and dad 's mistake : a sort of shotgun wedding without the pregnancy . ' '
I 'm too young , '' William is reported to have told friends , which seems reasonable , though the Middletons were shown promising signs of favour , such as being invited to Sandhurst for the prince 's passing out parade , very much a family event .
So something must have happened , over and above those princely groping photos taken during an army outing to a Bournemouth nightclub .
It 's not the end of the world and certainly not worth 10 minutes of our business when nasty and important things are happening elsewhere .
There is also the class thing , is n't there ?
The newspapers love this angle because it allows them to pander to their aspirational readers ' prejudices . ' '
Kate was too middle class '' thundered the Mail on Sunday above a piece which claimed that the prince 's friends and - that old standby as hate figures - ' ' senior courtiers '' mocked Ms Middleton 's background as a middle class girl from Bucklebury in Berkshire whose mother used to be an airline stewardess .
Actually you could argue that Bucklebury is nearer the smart end of the county , close to Cameron Country at Peasemore , while Her Maj is stuck under the Heathrow airport flight path ( we can all pee over Windsor Castle if so minded ) and has to look out over Slough , just beyond Eton , her local comp .
But that 's not how the game is played .
So all sorts of conveniently snide remarks are being trotted out , unattributably , of course , such as how Kate 's mum , Carol Middleton , was too pushy and even chewed gum in the royal presence : unlikely surely ?
The Queen is supposed to have remarked that Kate might have been troubled less by the paparazzi ' ' if she did n't wear short skirts and knee - length boots '' so often .
HMQ is also said to have disapproved of the way Ms Middleton did n't get a proper job after graduating until becoming an accessories buyer for Jigsaw , which is run by family friends .
Yes , I know what you 're thinking , but being Queen is probably harder than it looks .
Whatever the truth , the heir - but - one to the British crown has parted with his trainer girlfriend and life will go on .
Not least for the paparazzi , who can concentrate on the next crop of unlucky candidates to become the new Diana , poor soul .
At a Guardian lunch during one of her doomed media charm offensives Diana told us that the snappers were very aggressive ( ' ' they try to make you cry ...
they use the F - word '' ) because they get a better picture that way .
Even allowing for her manipulative charm and hunger as well as loathing for publicity it sounded awful .
I had attended Di 's wedding to Charlie Windsor on behalf of the Guardian and thought that he was being dragooned into marrying the last upper class 19-year - old virgin in England .
It seemed mean to say so at the time .
As for Ms Middleton she may come to realise she has had a lucky escape .
But I read that Sir Richard Branson , a family friend , may offer her ' ' a retreat somewhere '' to get over it all .
Out of the fat into the fire , Katie .
He 'll have you serving the G&amp;Ts to the first class passengers like mummy - above Windsor Castle , not in it , the safer place to be ."
2007-04-18,"Call me naive , but I have been a little taken aback by the general interest in who Prince William will choose next to be the lucky lady in his life .
It 's not that I 'm shocked so many people in this country give two hoots about who a 20-something , politically irrelevant Sloane will choose to accompany him to his various polo playing duties .
God no - this is one area in which we Yanks envy you Brits .
Just look at how excited we get every time Fergie comes to visit .
No , what surprised me is that I 'd assumed you 'd long since transferred your need for dynastic soap operas away from the ultimately disappointing Windsors and on to glitzier families .
What other explanation can there be for such veneration for the children of celebrities in this country ?
From the seemingly endless progeny of the Rolling Stones to Bob Geldof 's impressively confident daughters , stories about the children of British celebrities seem to bring no end of interest to the media and are increasingly held up as aspirational , magazine - cover role models , despite having only accomplished the feat of being born .
The British fashion world has been particularly enamoured of those who accomplish this .
When Burberry re - launched itself a few years back with a glitzy advertising campaign , it played on the idea of glamorous British families by featuring royal nephew Freddie Windsor .
In the current campaign he has been shunted into the background in favour of Keith Richards ' daughters and Bryan Ferry 's hunting - happy sons .
Lizzie Jagger is in the ubiquitous M&amp;S adverts .
For next season , Paul Smith 's menswear collection is inspired by "" sons of rock stars , who can just shrug on their dad 's vintage velvet jacket on top of their tuxes "" .
In America we have long been engrossed by the antics of our celebrities ' offspring , from Nicole Richie to Lisa Marie Presley .
Britain , I assumed , apparently misguidedly , was a more sceptical nation , less willing to give people such an easy ride .
The scepticism encountered by Stella McCartney when she first got into fashion design suggested that a certain level of British cynicism was alive and well .
Now , Lily Allen is touted as one of the nation 's proudest exports and Mohammed Al Fayed 's daughter , Jasmine , has her very own fashion show in Paris .
( Incidentally , does anyone know what it is that Jade Jagger actually does ?
Something with jewellery , was n't it ?
And does n't she DJ ?
Along with "" fashion stylist "" and "" lingerie designer "" , DJ seems to be the favoured occupation of the famous progeny , practised with enthusiasm by the likes of Leah - as in Ronnie - Wood , les Geldof filles and , I 'd be willing to bet good money , Jack and Kelly Osbourne . )
So what changed ?
Partly , the attitude to celebrities .
Not only can one be granted celebrity status for a lot less than used to be the case , but we want to know a lot more about their personal lives - hence the interest in their children .
There is something about seeing a person 's mutated DNA that suggests unfettered access to their personal life , to a part of them that no PR can control .
Of course , being sarcastic about someone just because of their parents is as unattractive as fawning over them for the same reason .
Lily Allen and Stella McCartney have actually made their own careers - and ones , notably , not practised by their famous parents .
But the current veneration of those with famous surnames is as embarrassing as any form of blinkered royalism .
Anyway , back to Prince William and his future girlfriend .
Two frontrunners seem to be emerging .
According to "" royal sources "" , there is Isabella Anstruther - Gough - Calthorpe , who seems to be several people 's child but no one famous , so therefore of limited interest .
Then there 's Holly Branson , pride and joy of Richard himself .
Now we 're talking . ·

2007-04-23,"The Prince William and Kate Middleton saga has exercised every media commentator .
In broad terms they all agree that it 's impossible to know the truth despite the acres of print devoted to the topic .
Peter Wilby in The Guardian argues that almost all the speculation was based on false assumptions .
Stephen Glover in The Independent snorts at the claim that class differences played any part at all in the couple 's split .
And Peter Cole in the Independent on Sunday is amazed that the press are bothering to give the royal family so much attention when young readers are indifferent to monarchy .
Peter Preston in The Observer notes that it is the media that is middle class .
That 's why papers latched on to the class aspect , even though we are assured that it played no part whatsoever in the break - up .
strong&gt;Brian
Cathcart in the New Statesman thinks that "" Fleet Street 's finest galloping off in all directions at once "" is "" quite a spectacle . ""
In all five cases I suspect there is an underlying argument : if papers can get this kind of story so hopelessly wrong , relying on speculation engendered by the ( supposed ) whispers of "" friends "" and "" sources "" , what about other stories of greater import ?"
2007-04-25,"Bravo to Victoria Newton for spotting the absolute weirdest story of the day and spinning it to within an inch of its life .
Picking up on US R&amp;B artist Amerie 's comment that "" Prince William is hot ! ""
Newton rapidly flew into Cilla mode : "" Following his split from Kate Middleton , I think I 've found the perfect new girlfriend for Prince William ! ""
' Course you have !
Because if Kate Middleclass was n't posh enough to be future queen of England then a foreigner most famous for wearing hotpants and claiming she loves the UK because of the "" horses and stuff "" is gon na be right up the Windsors ' street .
Come to think of it , that Britney seems to be single at the moment too ...
While Simon Cowell is busy flexing his sarcastic eyebrows at inappropriate times in the States , Louis Walsh still refuses to go quietly and leave the X Factor dream behind .
Conspicuously absent from the tabloid pages for more than a day or so , the latest update on Walsh comes from the man himself .
"" I will never work with Cowell again , "" the Sun reports him saying in today 's paper .
"" I want nothing to do with X Factor or Cowell . ""
Fair enough , but was n't that kind of Simon 's decision when he sacked you a few months back ?
Apparently not , as it turns out the Irishman was still signed up to work his magic on the winning acts as a "" behind the scenes "" man in the next X Factor series .
He added , "" I will not be managing X Factor 's winning act ; I will manage the winning Joseph [ on Any Dream WIll Do ] instead . ""
Well , if going on and on and on and on about being sacked from your high - profile TV spot was n't going to plague Simon Cowell with guilt and regret , doing the reality TV equivalent of taking your ball home certainly will ."
2007-04-30,"Oxford tops the Guardian rankings as the best university for students , according to new league tables published by EducationGuardian.co.uk today .
Arch rivals Cambridge and Imperial College are in second and third place , while Prince William 's alma mater St Andrews soars into fourth place on the strength of high student satisfaction ratings .
Other powerhouses in the capital , University College London and the London School of Economics , fill the next places , followed by Edinburgh , Warwick , Bath and Loughborough universities .
Oxbridge departments account for many of the top spots in results for individual subjects but new universities shine in some subjects - Bournemouth and Brighton first and second in tourism , Oxford Brookes tops social work , while Bedfordshire ( formerly Luton ) ranks third in media and communication behind Russell group giants Newcastle and Sheffield .
When it comes to sports science , Bath and Loughborough rule .
In chemistry , the winner was the Sussex University department threatened with closure until a public outcry helped ensure its survival last year , although the most popular chemistry department with students was Loughborough , awarded 10/10 for teaching and feedback .
Professor Andrew Smith , the head of the chemistry department at Sussex , said : "" Our position reflects both the quality and success of our undergraduates and the underlying quality of the educational provision at Sussex and we look forward to building on this in the future . ""
The Guardian 's University Guide 2008 is aimed at helping prospective students choose courses - so it concentrates less than alternative tables on research ratings .
It judges courses on the student verdict on teaching and feedback , gathered from final year undergraduates in the National Student Survey , plus spending per student , staff / student ratios , job prospects , entry qualifications and a value - added measure comparing individuals ' entry qualifications with their degree results .
The average subject scores , weighted according to the number of students , go to make a Guardian score for the institutions .
Oxford 's vice - chancellor , John Hood , said he was delighted by the recognition for the oldest university in the English - speaking world . ""
The result says volumes about the high calibre of our students and staff , the quality of our research and teaching , and the fantastic libraries , museums and other resources I am proud to say we can offer scholars . ""
St Andrews , Scotland 's oldest university , came third in English , modern languages and maths and pipped UCL for the fourth place overall .
The principal , Brian Lang , commented : "" Given that we do not have the additional spending power and competitive advantage which tuition fees have given our sister institutions south of the Border , this is a good result , not just for St Andrews but for Scottish higher education . ""
The online guide links to brief profiles of universities and colleges ( including the bursaries they offer ) and for the first time this year
it gives information on the sort of skills a student can expect to acquire in studying a particular subject and the sort of jobs open to him or her .
The tables have been compiled for EducationGuardian.co.uk by Campus Pi , an applied research unit at Brunel University , from data returned by the universities to the Higher Education Statistics Agency ( Hesa ) .
The tables are based on data for full - time undergraduates , so institutions like the Open University and Birkbeck College London which specialise in part - time students , or Cranfield which is a postgraduate institution , do not feature .
Two universities - Keele and London Metropolitan - did not allow their data to be used ."
2007-05-15,"It was a brief moment of royal openness , now swiftly abandoned - if you have n't already perused Prince William 's Facebook entry then forget it .
After a flurry of media interest as it emerged the heir - but - one had signed up to the public networking site , the electronic portals have come crashing down .
Browsers , while unable to view the prince 's full profile , had been able to see a self - posted picture of William in ski hat and goggles , as well as pictures posted by his 44 listed Facebook friends .
These included Alexandra Aitken , the daughter of once - jailed Conservative MP Jonathan Aitken , and Jack Kidd , the polo - playing brother of model Jodie Kidd .
This morning , however , the sole profile viewable under William Wales revealed a blank face to the world , with a question mark in place of a picture .
Browsers were not allowed to see the person 's pictures or view their friends .
It is unlikely even to be the same person , with the real William - or an Internet - savvy flunkey - having most probably adjusted various profile settings so it can only be found by approved friends and not just any Facebook browser .
A search for William Wales does indeed come up with two results , but only the one is shown .
Undeterred , would - be friends , not to mention young ladies keen to take over the vacancy left by Kate Middleton , have been busy sending "" pokes "" -- a Facebook facility alerting another member you 're thinking of them - to the William Wales who is listed .
As is the way with these things , as of last night a new Facebook group has emerged , "" I poked Prince William "" , with 61 members and counting , not to mention a message from one sceptic telling people they are almost certainly pestering the wrong Mr Wales .
Brent Johnson from Calgary has posted an even more succinct message to the group : "" I think you should stop stalking the prince and go back to fixing your pathetic little life . """
2007-05-15,"Pop star Lily Allen cries her eyes out on the world 's favourite social network MySpace at being "" fat , ugly and shitter than Winehouse "" , while William Wales ( Prince William to you and me ) becomes the most popular single male on Facebook , the social networking site most highly revered by uni graduates .
So what , tut the masses ?
Why in the first place , some might say , did Allen bother to pour out her personal malaise on a blog post which would be read by thousands ?
Was it attention - seeking , waiting with self - satisfied glee for each comment that would left in support of her by her adoring fans , rallying against the need for girls and young women to feel that they should aspire to a size zero ?
The fact is that Allen 's frustrations and public tears are merely a reflection of what goes on daily on tens of thousands of young girls ' ( and boys ' ) profiles on MySpace , Bebo or MSNSpaces .
In the 80s , growing up in the West of Scotland , most of my teenage girlfriends ( and some of the blokes , too ) would read Just 17 or some other tabloidese magazine for their juicy problem pages : discussions of sex , depression , keeping thin and beautiful .
Things have changed .
Today 's teen magazines are effectively created constantly online , all the time , by their readers for their own friends .
And I 'm not sure if it 's a bad thing or not .
Kids as young as eight click to say that they are "" over the age of 13 "" and enter the wonderfully complex , messy and downright fun universe of social networking .
Occasionally , on a bad day , they will write the problem pages of 2007 - on the web , by real people and , with no editor to apply the tippex , leaving nothing to the imagination .
Allen 's problems fade into pale insignificance , in fact , when you read some of the traumas your average teen is writing about this evening , after tea has been served and parents are catching some zs in front of the television .
What used to be private , discussed only with a few intimate friends in a corner of the playground or on the way home , is now discussed with a few more less intimate profiles , potentially the whole web , should someone stumble across your woes .
The whole sense of what is private and what is public has changed significantly in the past two years , referred to in anodyne terminology where everyone can be your Contact , most people are your Friend , and a few might be Family (
but they 're almost certainly your Best Friends ) .
Knowing where your salacious tales are going to be published does n't seem to matter any longer to today 's young people .
Most of the time it is just your friends reading up on you .
But there 's also a particularly good chance of being read up on if your name is William Wales .
For a family who seemed to have already shown their strong thoughts on the importance of privacy , this week saw the arrival on Facebook of the Prince , HRH , Wills or , if you 're already his Friend or Contact , "" William Wales "" .
Even royalty has succumbed like so many of us to this connective tissue of every graduate 's life .
Right now the second in line to the throne might be adding his university , his place of employment , his home town and getting ready to squander hours linking up with all his old school friends , workmates and ex - girlfriends .
Ouch .
Sorry , Wills .
But if there 's one thing that a FaceBook profile is good for , it 's dating .
Mark yourself as single , tell a few more of those woeful days you 've had feeling fat and ugly and just wait for the "" Add as Friend "" requests to come in .
Then again , you might just end up with random requests from curious bloggers ."
2007-05-16,"This week came the news that "" William Wales "" had joined the social networking site Facebook .
Yesterday there was much argument about whether it was a hoax or not .
Would Prince William really post a profile on the net ?
The answer is : well , why not ?
After all , this is how most people his age keep tabs on their mates .
With websites such as Facebook and MySpace constantly being talked about in the media , it must be easy to feel like a 20th - century luddite if you are n't already part of the in - crowd .
Here lies a great disconnect at the heart of 21st - century socialising : either you 're in ( and use every social networking website you can ) or you 're out ( and do n't use them at all ) .
It 's important to remember , then , that while millions gobble up Facebook and the like , it 's still a minority sport .
Of course , "" early adopters "" , drawn like magpies to the latest , shiniest things , will sign up for every new website they find , and no doubt already think Facebook old hat .
But if you 're one of the millions of people who feels left out , or simply left cold , by the social networking revolution , then do n't worry : our guide , written by dedicated fans , will help turn you from an outcast into a social networking superstar .
Bobbie Johnson , technology correspondent Facebook
By Helen Pidd
By midday yesterday , the Facebook group I Poked Prince William had amassed 85 members .
But before the tabloids get their cheque books out to buy up Mark from Northern Ireland and a bra - clad woman from London called Sally , it probably needs explaining that , in Facebook parlance , "" poke "" means nothing more dirty than giving someone an electronic wave .
All 23 million members of Facebook are able to look up the names of fellow Facebookers and give them an interwebular nudge .
If your pokee pokes you back , you can look at their full profile for a week , and they yours .
This is fun , as profiles are normally private .
Useful , too : how else can you check out whether this William Wales guy is for real ?
But mostly people like doing it because it sounds rude ( indeed , one of my favourite Facebook groups is called Enough of the Poking ,
Let 's Just Have Sex , and boasts almost 180,000 members ) .
But do n't worry about that for now .
What you really need to know is that Facebook is simply a way of keeping in touch with your friends online .
Unlike MySpace , it is not a gift for stalkers and spammers , because you have a lot more control over who can find you : you can decide what comes up if someone puts your name into Facebook 's search engine .
Ordinarily , you can also see a thumbnail of someone 's profile picture , and a list of people they are friends with .
The latter function means that Facebook is like a souped - up , free version of Friends Reunited .
Wondering if I 'm the Helen Pidd you went to school with and ca n't tell from the little photo on my page ?
The number of people from Morecambe High School
I 'm friends with
will tell you I am , and save you the shame of poking the wrong person .
Still confused ?
When you join up , you first create a profile .
This includes a carefully chosen picture , titbits about one 's life , a facility for uploading and sharing an unlimited number of photos , a "" status "" function that sends out a one - line alert to all of your friends telling them what you 're up to ( eg "" Helen needs to get a life "" ) , and a public "" wall "" .
All your friends can see what people write on your wall .
This important fact is often forgotten : at a party on Saturday I had to reprimand a friend for having a nauseatingly saucy conversation with someone on his public wall .
About that party ... it was organised by Michael , someone I went to school with .
He invited 95 of his Facebook friends .
When I arrived at the do , I saw a guy from the year below me at school who I had n't seen since the last day of exams .
"" I did n't know you were still mates with Michael , "" I said .
Turns out he was n't really
: they had lost touch and found each other again on Facebook .
MySpace
By Laura Barton
There comes a time when you have to choose a side .
Good or evil .
Blur or Oasis .
Marmite or peanut butter .
In 2005 , after a long period of social - networking neutrality , I chose MySpace .
Like all the others , MySpace is a social networking site , but the difference is that its social glue is music .
Along with normal people 's profiles , bands have their own pages , maintained by themselves or their record company , where they can upload examples of their music , and news about upcoming shows and releases .
This has presented a new way for music fans ( and record labels ) to find music , and serves as a worthy alternative to listening to radio , attending gigs , reading the music press or knowing what is on general release .
It also provides a way for musicians to communicate more directly with their fans .
Lily Allen , for example , blogs regularly on her MySpace - just this week
she wrote openly of being in "" a sea of tears "" and researching liposuction and gastric bypass surgery after people had made ludicrous comments about her weight in the press .
Elsewhere , you 'll find numerous "" celebrity "" sites that have been constructed either by the celebrities themselves or "" fans "" : from Noel Edmonds to Jennifer Aniston , to Barack Obama , Tony Blair and George Bush .
Last year , the Conservative party had to deny that David Cameron 's MySpace ( www.myspace.com/david_cameron ) was a crude attempt to win the youth vote .
MySpace is a little older than some of the other networking sites - it was founded in 2003 and is now the the fifth most popular website in any language .
It acquires some 230,000 new users every day and , as of last October , boasted an estimated 106 m accounts .
In 2005 it was bought by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corporation for $ 580 m ( £ 290 m ) , a development that caused many users to bridle .
Signing up via the MySpace homepage is relatively easy .
Designing your profile page is somewhat harder , as it involves making some potentially tricky decisons : choosing a profile picture , a quote , and a song , whether you want to "" pimp "" your page ( ie , decorate it ) .
You will also need to supply a little blurb about yourself , your hobbies , the music , films , books you like , who you 'd like to meet , and choose your "" top friends "" .
The technology feels fairly clunky but I find that curiously attractive .
The site has a range of functions : email , bulletins , blogs , friend comments , photographs , groups , videos and music .
Other members can request your friendship ( and you theirs ) , though you can set your profile to private if you really want to keep the busybodies out .
It might seem , I suppose , an odd thing to spill out so many personal details on a website , to conduct private conversations in public , to chat to unknown people in Arizona just because you both like the Moldy Peaches .
But I rather like the fact that in this impersonal city where I now live , where no one looks each other in the eye or speaks to strangers on the bus , there is all this warmth bubbling away online .
Bebo By Natalie Hanman "" Bright , colourful and cheesy "" is how one Beboer - a Bebo.com user - describes this social - networking site .
Which might be why it has a reputation for attracting even younger users than its online competitors , with most of its visitors ( 30 % ) aged 18 to 24 .
Bebo , founded in 2005 , quickly expanded to enable sociable young web users to do all they could possibly desire : from uploading photos , posting comments and sending emails , to quizzes , picture slide - shows and blogs .
The whiteboard feature on a user 's easily personalised profile is a particular pull , on which other users can draw colourful pictures - typically detailing what your friends got up to the night before .
Now , according to the latest weekly audience figures from Hitwise , Bebo is the most popular website in the "" net communities and chat "" category , just beating MySpace to the top spot .
A recent deal with online music store 7Digital , plus the appointment of Angel Gambino , former vice - president of commercial , strategy and digital media at MTV , is all part of its push into the music side of social networking , with plans to allow users to share and download their favourite tracks .
In the words of a Bebo spokesman : "" It 's much more intuitive and engaging than Barack Obama having a MySpace profile . ""
Twitter By Bobbie Johnson Twitter is much simpler than the other social - networking sites that fill up the internet .
All it asks is one thing - "" What are you doing ? ""
- and you answer , either via your mobile or your computer .
Twitter then tells all your friends , via a text on their mobiles or a message online , and they send their own messages back .
That 's it .
At first , using Twitter is like walking into a noisy party where you do n't know anybody , filled with confusing chatter .
Too many friends and you quickly drown in the minutiae of other people 's lives .
But once you start getting used to it , it 's more like dipping your finger into a fast - flowing river : things fly by and you catch hold of the ones you want .
For some , it 's just blogging for the lazy .
Others use it to message their mates en masse .
Like all these networks , Twitter 's real strengths only appear when you have the right friends .
Still , with the service doubling in size every few weeks , it wo n't be long until somebody you know is using it already .
Just one thing - when you sign up , make sure you add me to your friends list ,
yeah ?
Second Life
By Aleks Krotoski
You may have heard of Second Life , a brave new world taking the internet by storm , promising to change your view of reality , make you a millionaire and give you powerful tools to realise your full potential .
Behind the headlines lies a compelling space that may change how we use the internet .
When you join Second Life - which you can do for free - you create your digital persona , or avatar .
This little person can be personalised as you see fit .
You can choose everything from the size of your nose to the colour of your nails .
Inside Second Life , which has six million users , everything looks pretty much like the outside world : there are clubs , shops , universities , offices and theatres .
Unlike most online spaces , where you interact with a website on your own , you 're surrounded by other people , in avatar form , experiencing the same things at the same time .
You can sit down together on sofas and have coffee and a chat ( using either your voice or your keyboard ) , go to a festival and dance among the throngs to the music being streamed live - for real - from a bar in Los Angeles , or discuss the finer points of the art in a gallery .
What makes it special is what people have done with it .
As a world built for and by an international population of adults with an average age of 33 , the space is littered with innumerable examples of superb interactive design by real - world architects , musicians , artists and others .
As more services arrive from the outside , it has become a new way for consumers to go online to browse and buy , teach and train , socialise and surf .
Second Life is a place for self - expression and for hanging out with friends , limited only by the boundaries of your imagination .
Aleks Krotoski is studying towards a PhD at the University of Surrey , exploring the social networks of Second Life .
Almost every other website The sheer , unabashed popularity of MySpace , Facebook and other big social sites has been impossible for the rest of the web to ignore .
The result is that right now almost every major site is trying desperately to build some kind of social - network element in order to appear hip .
This desperate rush to create a network for every occasion is reminiscent of the dotcom boom , when slapping a web address on any half - baked idea was a licence to print money .
But soon you 'll see it everywhere :
newspapers such as the Sun have already joined in , niche - interest sites are grabbing hold of it with both hands and
it wo n't be long before you see it on the BBC website .
Sometimes the social web works brilliantly .
Flickr.com , the photo website , is a well - regarded pioneer because it served a brilliant purpose : making it simple to share your pictures with family and friends .
Often , though , new networks seem like the handiwork of some internet Frankenstein with pound signs in place of brain cells .
The number of "" me too "" services and rip - offs is growing faster than it is possible to count .
Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , for example , have developed their own network for pets , the appropriately named SNIF ( Social Networking in Fur ) .
With a simple chip in your pet 's collar , you can track down appropriate canine chums - or stay away from the dogs you do n't like .
In the longer term , though , the success stories could be the ones where brainiacs learn to put the power of social networks to help users , rather than just monopolise their time .
One example is the UK - based internet radio service Last.fm , which matches your taste in music to other people and uses that "" attention data "" to play you new tracks by groups it thinks you 'll like .

2007-05-18,"The Press Complaints Commission has effectively cleared the News of the World of any illegal conspiracy in the Clive Goodman royal phone - hacking scandal .
There was "" no evidence "" that anyone else at the paper was aware of Goodman 's illegal activities , the PCC said today as it concluded its investigation into the affair , which saw the jailing of Goodman , the paper 's former royal editor .
Goodman , who has since been sacked by the paper , secretly paid private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to illegally access mobile phone messages left by Prince William and Prince Harry for staff members of the royal household .
The scandal resulted in Goodman and Mulcaire being jailed on January 26 after they were convicted of offences under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and Criminal Law Act .
Goodman was sentenced to four months in prison and Mulcaire six months .
The News of the World editor at the time , Andy Coulson , resigned the day Goodman and Mulcaire were sentenced .
He was replaced by Colin Myler .
"" There is no evidence to challenge Mr Myler 's assertion that : Goodman had deceived his employer in order to obtain cash to pay Mulcaire ; that he had concealed the identity of the source of information on royal stories ; and that no one else at the News of the World knew that Messrs Goodman and Mulcaire were tapping phone messages for stories , "" the PCC said today .
However , the PCC did criticise the News International tabloid , saying its internal controls were "" clearly inadequate "" .
The PCC also issued six new recommendations on undercover newsgathering and compliance with its code of practice .
It said it found "" numerous examples of good practice throughout the industry , both as regards the code of practice and the Data Protection Act "" The PCC added that Mr Myler had improved internal controls at the paper since taking over , including more robust contracts of employment with staff members and external contributors .
Mr Myler told the PCC that the Goodman episode represented "" an exceptional and unhappy event in the 163-year history of the News of the World , involving one journalist "" .
He emphasised the newspaper 's commitment to the code of practice and said an unnamed reporter had been dismissed for breaching its terms .
During the court case the News of the World admitted that it paid Mulcaire a retainer of £ 104,988 per annum .
The court also heard that he had received £ 12,300 in cash from Goodman .
Mr Myler told the PCC that the paper had paid Mulcaire , a former Wimbledon footballer , for "" legal and legitimate "" work .
This included fact gathering , suggesting strategies , credit status checks , Land Registry checks , directorship searches and analysis of businesses and individuals .
Other activities Mulcaire carried out for the News of the World included tracing individuals from virtually no biographical details , date of birth searches , electoral roll searches and checks through databases ; County Court searches and analysis of court records , surveillance , specialist crime advice and professional football knowledge .
There had been a "" great deal of inaccurate media speculation "" concerning this contract , Mr Myler said .
Goodman also paid Mulcaire £ 12,300 in what the News of the World said was a "" direct and personal relationship "" .
The paper told the PCC that Goodman deceived his employers by disguising Mulcaire 's identity .
Goodman claimed that the payments were for a confidential source on royal stories , identified only as "" Alexander "" . ""
The identity of that source and the fact that the arrangement involved illegally accessing telephone voice mails was completely unknown and , indeed , deliberately concealed from all at the News of the World , "" the paper said .
"" It was made clear at the sentencing hearing that both the prosecution and the judge accepted that , "" Mr Myler told the PCC .
Mr Myler also told the PCC that the Goodman case appeared to have been a "" rogue exception "" and that the News of the World ordered external contributors to abide by the the watchdog 's code and the law .
Following Goodman 's conviction , Mr Myler he had emailed every member of staff individually , and written to them at home , with the PCC code of practice .
News of the World staff had been informed of a new clause in their contracts , that said failure to comply with the code of practice could result in summary dismissal .
Goodman is suing News International for unfair dismissal .

2007-06-05,"Thank you for allowing Paddy Harverson and me to view at your offices yesterday evening your programme about the death of Diana , Princess of Wales , which you intend to broadcast on 6th June .
Given that you were unwilling to release a copy for Prince William and Prince Harry to view personally , I verbally briefed the princes on the content of the programme last night immediately after the viewing .
Their Royal Highnesses have asked me to communicate to you in the strongest terms possible that their position remains unchanged from that clearly articulated by them in July 2006 , on the occasion of the Italian magazine , Chi , publishing a photograph of the scene surrounding their mother 's dying moments .
To remind you of what they said then : ' Following this week 's publication in an Italian magazine of material relating directly to the death of our mother , we feel deeply saddened that such a low has been reached . '
Despite the support shown to us and our mother 's memory by so many people over the last eight years , we feel that , as her sons , we would be failing in our duty to her now if we did not protect her - as she once did us . '
Therefore we appeal to all forms of media throughout the world to appreciate fully that publishing such material causes great hurt to us , our father , our mother 's family and all those who so loved and respected her . '
I explained to the princes the central focus of the programme and its themes , and , in particular , the part played by the paparazzi in the tragedy .
I do have to say , though , that this latter issue has already clearly been addressed in the findings of both the French police investigation and the Stevens report - and is , therefore , of debatable fresh ' public interest ' .
Even the graphic descriptions by Mr Lennox and the adviser to the French interior ministry of the facial wounds of the dying princess are not something that we feel we can challenge - although obviously they are extremely distressing for the princes to have to hear and see broadcast to a public audience .
But the pictures are another matter .
I must ask you not to broadcast those photographs that depict the crashed car whilst the princes ' mother lies dying in its wreckage .
Also , I ask on the princes ' behalf that the shot of the ambulance , with a medic clearly administering emergency treatment to the unseen figure of the princess , not be broadcast .
These photographs , regardless of the fact that they do not actually show the princess 's features , are redolent with the atmosphere and tragedy of the closing moments of her life .
As such , they will cause the princes acute distress if they are shown to a public audience , not just for themselves , but also on their mother 's behalf , in the sense of intruding upon the privacy and dignity of her last minutes .
As they said in their statement last year , ' ... we feel that , as her sons , we would be failing in our duty to her now if we did not protect her - as she once did us ' .
Put simply , if it were your or my mother dying in that tunnel
would we want the scene broadcast to the nation ?
Indeed , would the nation so want it ?
I must , therefore , ask you to give this matter your immediate attention , and have your written response to my specific requests by no later than nine o'clock on Monday morning , 4th June ."
2007-06-06,"Channel 4 insisted yesterday it would include pictures of the crash that killed Princess Diana in a documentary to be aired tonight despite a strongly worded personal plea from her sons , Prince William and Prince Harry .
The broadcaster refused to back down after Clarence House made public a letter on behalf of the princes asking for photographs of the crash scene , which would cause "" gross disrespect "" to their mother 's memory , to be removed from the programme .
In the letter , their private secretary , Jamie Lowther - Pinkerton , said : "" They will cause the princes acute distress if they are shown to a public audience , not just for themselves , but also on their mother 's behalf , in the sense of intruding upon the privacy and dignity of her last minutes "" .
He added : "" Put simply , if it were your or my mother dying in that tunnel would we want the scene broadcast to the nation ?
Indeed , would the nation want it ? ""
Clarence House protested after Channel 4 took what it said was an "" unprecedented decision "" last week to arrange a private viewing for Mr Lowther - Pinkerton and the communications secretary , Paddy Harverson , in light of the extensive press coverage .
After watching the programme , they briefed the princes and sent a letter to Channel 4 with a deadline of 9 am on Monday to reply .
In a long reply sent yesterday , the Channel 4 director of television and content , Kevin Lygo , defended the inclusion of the photographs as "" crucial "" to the programme 's analysis and says that acceding to their removal would have created "" a dangerous precedent "" .
He said : "" This is in our view a legitimate media analysis of events which , whilst inevitably personally distressing , concerns matters of immense public interest which have been ( and are likely to continue to be ) the subject of ongoing and extensive worldwide reports and comment over a significant period . ""
The programme , Diana :
The Witnesses in the Tunnel , was made by ITN and through reconstruction , archive footage , still images and eyewitness accounts , tells the story of the photographers who were blamed by many for hounding her to death .
Julian Bellamy , the recently appointed head of programming at Channel 4 , yesterday claimed it was the most "" detailed and credible eyewitness account yet of an event of international importance "" .
"" The programme goes no further visually or in tone than many previous British TV and newspaper reports , "" he said .
Channel 4 said a number of the more contentious pictures had already appeared elsewhere , including a BBC Panorama documentary and the front page of the Sun , and that the faces of the victims were never shown . ""
Commentators who have watched the programme for preview purposes have agreed that it is a responsible documentary .
We believe this view will be shared by those who watch it , "" added Mr Bellamy .
The programme 's makers said it was a "" balanced , sober and trustworthy analysis "" .
Clarence House is understood to feel that whether or not the pictures have been seen before is immaterial and that it is the context that is particularly distressing .
Channel 4 insiders blamed the furore on an avalanche of false pre - publicity which had suggested the programme contained "" graphic images "" , including a Daily Mail front page headlined Trampling on Diana 's grave .
The broadcaster 's top triumvirate of chairman Luke Johnson , chief executive , Andy Duncan , and Mr Lygo are already under pressure after a string of controversies , including the Richard and Judy
You Say , We Pay scandal and outcries over a range of programmes .
The most serious came with the 44,500 complaints and criticism from Ofcom for "" serious editorial misjudgment "" over the way it handled the Big Brother race row .
Channel 4 said yesterday the programme was a sober and insightful analysis of a hitherto underexplored aspect of the death of Princess Diana and her partner , Dodi Fayed , in a Paris underpass in August 1997 . ""
This is really high quality , well thought through stuff .
When I commissioned this programme , what appealed to me was the quality of the journalism , "" said Hamish Mykura , the head of specialist factual at Channel 4 .
Channel 4 non - executive director Lord Puttnam has called it a "" cracking piece of investigative journalism "" .
MPs and commentators were split on whether the broadcaster was right to refuse to edit the film at the behest of the princes .
The Lib Dem 's culture , media and sport spokesman Don Foster said : "" Channel 4 is right to refuse the princes ' request ...
Editorial decisions should not be made by ill - informed media hysteria but in the public interest and within existing broadcasting codes . ""
But the Tory culture spokesman , Hugo Swire , said Channel 4 "" would be crossing a line if they chose to press ahead regardless "" .
"" We hope that it will now recognise the deep upset that is being caused by this ongoing debate over the documentary , and will act appropriately , "" he added ."
2007-06-30,"Prince William and Prince Harry toured a cold and rain - lashed Wembley Stadium yesterday as they inspected the final preparations for today 's Concert for Diana .
The brothers were taken around the £ 800 m arena and given an insight into the work of backroom production staff as they put the finishing touches to the event on what would have been the Princess 's 46th birthday .
The princes are putting on the celebration to commemorate their mother 's life 10 years after she died in a car crash .
Prince William said Diana would have been ' amazed ' that he and Harry had managed to put together the concert .
Speaking on stage at Wembley as rehearsals went on behind them , the princes said the day would be all about ' remembering her ' .
The Concert for Diana will see Elton John , Rod Stewart , Status Quo , Lily Allen and Take That , among others , take to the stage in front of a crowd of 62,000 . '
If we could fit more people in here we would , ' said William , 25 . '
To us
it is all about creating the right image for what we wanted .
It is all about getting the feel right . '
The event would not be possible , he added , if it were not for all the ' lovely little people running around ' and organising things . '
Apart from the weather , it is the most amazing scenery and the most amazing setting , ' added Harry .
Before answering questions the princes watched pop star Joss Stone warm up .
In bare feet , the 20-year - old singer jumped across the stage singing her hit single
' You Have Me ' and Queen 's ' Under Pressure ' . '
That warm - up was pretty damn good , ' said William afterwards .
But the dozens of journalists gathered under umbrellas had another topic in mind .
Kate Middleton : would she or would n't she turn up ?
William 's on - off girlfriend helped organise the event and was apparently keen to come along .
But William is said to be unsure about the relationship . '
I 've got lots of friends coming , ' he said , not denying that she would make an appearance . '
So everyone is going to be there on the night and it is going to be a great night . '
Harry laughed and added : ' Very well avoided , William - very diplomatic . '
Harry himself was teased by an Australian journalist , who quipped that the prince would be keeping the drinks flowing in Britain . '
That is a little unfair , is n't it ? '
joked Harry ."
2007-07-02,"With more than 21 million users worldwide and 100,000 new users each week , the social networking website Facebook has rapidly entered the mainstream .
But with its phenomenal growth comes an increasing threat to privacy .
Not so long ago the site was the domain of computer geeks and students , but now it is attracting famous members such as Sienna Miller and Prince William .
Even journalists and commentators such as Jonathan Dimbleby and Andrew Neil have signed up .
The website has a sophisticated mechanism that allows its members to choose the extent to which users can access their personal profile , photographs , list of friends , and their "" wall "" ( a type of discussion forum that allows friends to post messages on each other 's page ) .
It even allows users to block specific individuals from knowing that they are a member of Facebook at all .
However , despite the privacy controls , many users post photographs of their private parties and holidays , which may include pictures of acquaintances who have no wish to be on public display in this way .
Users also often post abusive and sometimes defamatory material on the walls of other users .
At the same time , the privacy law continues to develop .
The Court of Appeal recently upheld an award of damages to Canadian singer Loreena McKennitt after a book by a former employee , Niema Ash , revealed details of McKennitt 's private life .
It is the latest in a string of important decisions that have given rise to a new law of privacy which celebrities and other high - profile individuals are seizing upon with relish .
In light of these developments , individuals who find their images posted on Facebook may well have a claim .
Threatening Anyone wishing to take out a complaint may consider whether to bring the claim against Facebook or against one or more users .
However , at least in Europe , Facebook may be able to avail itself of a defence under e - commerce legislation if it can show that it is simply hosting the information , and that it acted quickly on any complaint .
Individual users may therefore find themselves being held responsible .
When signing up to Facebook , users agree not to "" upload , post , transmit , share , store or otherwise make available any content that [ Facebook ] deems to be harmful , threatening , unlawful , defamatory , infringing , abusive , inflammatory , harassing , vulgar , obscene , fraudulent , invasive of privacy or publicity rights , hateful , or racially , ethnically or otherwise objectionable "" .
A comprehensive list , which many users are ignoring .
In practice , libellous and private material is removed only after a complaint has been made either to the administrators of the website or the offending user .
This means that private and offensive photographs , which can easily be shared with other users of Facebook , could be quickly spread before the victim has had a chance to do anything about it .
Although users of Facebook can edit their own privacy settings , they have no control of who their "" friends "" are sharing information and photographs with .
And so , despite Facebook 's privacy policy , the website still poses an enormous risk to privacy .
Some may say that users waive their privacy rights .
But this all depends on the extent to which they have applied their privacy settings and says nothing of the many people featured on Facebook who are not signed up .
Those people might want to register quickly to see what their friends and foes are up to behind their backs .

2007-07-02,"I bet you look good on the dancefloor ( at Boujis ) :
Prince Harry and Prince William bust some moves at the Concert for Diana .
Photograph :
Dave Hogan / Getty Images Fearne Cotton 's preview interview with Princes William and Harry lead made me see the future monarch and his perma - frowning brother in a new light .
A very favourable light .
Despite perpetually dressing like Hugh Grant on down time , they insisted , Frank Gallagher - like , that the Concert for Diana was going to be "" a party ! "" , one from which all senior members of their family were banned .
They mocked their father 's musical cluelessness and steered the nation away from a potential mass - mourning .
"" It 's a party , "" they reiterated .
"" A celebration ! ""
Yet the reality felt quite different .
Perhaps you had to be there , but the atmosphere projected during the six - and - a - half hour TV emote - a - thon could n't have been less party - like .
The crowd was lifeless , overbearingly white and utterly rigid .
Camera scans of the crowd showed the Princes surrounded by their Chelsea set chums , looking down from their royal box , occasionally rising to groove on down to the hard stuff like The Feeling and Orson .
Everyone sang along , but no - one knew the words .
Especially Princess Beatrice , who looked like a mental goldfish all day .
It was n't the new Wembley 's fault , either .
Muse recently played there two nights running and made it feel like the Camden Barfly .
In space .
No , there was simply no joyous abandon to this concert , none of the energy or mayhem that makes a gig great , no atmosphere .
Even the predictable cast of characters failed to do what they were meant to do : entertain .
Joss Stone trotted and honked , Mariah - like .
Fergie ( the other one ) wound and ground her ass , but her mic was on so low
she just looked silly .
Lily Allen loosened things up with some straight - up summer songs , while P Diddy proved why he is easily the 34th best rapper of his generation .
Tom Jones ' threat to cover Arctic Monkeys
I
Bet
You Look on the Dance Floor meanwhile saw the walnut - like one reduce the 00s ' best single to a flat soul song , which nevertheless proved a highlight by default .
Diana favourite Roger Hodgson from Supertramp 's high - pitched medley - which included Breakfast In America , a record Paul Burrell was accused of half - inching from the royal rock collection - seemed practically avant garde in comparison .
Then there was Ricky Gervais shamelessly whoring his infamous David Brent dance routine again .
"" I 'm not doing it ! ""
he protested , before , well , doing it in front of "" 63,000 ! ""
people .
Still , it 's something to talk about next time he 's on Jonathon Ross .
Take That foolishly lead with a Mark Owen number , who still sings like a trapped boy .
And between each act - silence .
Deathly silence , like the lull that follows a nasty accident .
Because we all know fun can not simply be fabricated or forced .
Great gigs require volume , alcohol , interaction , underlying tension , the threat that things might go off .
In a time when the British music scene is the strongest and most diverse it has been in years , predictably the bill just did n't reflect public tastes .
Where were the rough diamonds from the provinces , like the aforementioned Monkeys who genuinely are way bigger than - say - Orson ?
Where was Dizzee Rascal , Biffy Clyro , Amy Winehouse , MIA , Klaxons , Gallows or the aforementioned Muse - all bands who reflect different facets of the UK scene in 2007 ?
All a million miles from here , clearly .
By the time Selton - as he is known - closed the show with his moribund piano ballads , pack lunches had been eaten and comfortable trainers had been broken in , another "" historical "" event chalked up . ""
Now that was a party ! ""

2007-07-11,"The chairman of the Press Complaints Commission , Sir Christopher Meyer , has defended the watchdog against accusations from MPs that it had failed to protect Kate Middleton from media intrusion .
Sir Christopher was responding to today 's Commons culture , media and sport select committee report , which branded the PCC 's handling of media coverage of Ms Middleton , Prince William 's former girlfriend , as "" less than impressive "" .
He said the select committee report had been "" a tad unfair "" and defended the PCC 's lack of action before the media "" feeding frenzy "" on Ms Middleton 's birthday on January 9 , saying that there was no complaint for the regulator to act on .
The select committee report concluded that the PCC was too slow to intervene when photographers were hounding Ms Middleton at the height of speculation over whether she was to become engaged to Prince William .
"" There are some very good things in this report , on this I think that John Whittingdale and his colleagues have been a tad unfair , "" Sir Christopher said , speaking on Radio 4 's Today programme .
He added that the PCC was in regularly in contact with Ms Middleton 's lawyers leading up to her birthday . ""
In those circumstances you can not take that kind of action unless the complainant agrees to it , "" Sir Christopher said .
"" We can not do this straight off our own bat , we are not out on the streets with the cameramen and we are in close contact with the very person who is looking after the interests of Kate Middleton .
"" It was three days later on January 12 that her lawyers demanded action .
The select committee report criticised the PCC for bringing editors ' attention to complaints from Ms Middleton 's soliticitor "" long after "" the worst abuses had occurred , particularly the media scrum outside her house on the morning of her birthday .
It said the PCC should alter its practice of waiting for complaints before acting . ""
The PCC should be readier to depart from its usual practice of issuing a desist notice only in response to a request , "" the select committee 's report concluded .
"" In the case of Ms Middleton , harassment was evident , yet photographs taken by the paparazzi continued to appear in national and regional papers .
We see no plausible public interest defence , "" it sad . ""
We conclude that editors , in failing to take care not to use pictures of Kate Middleton obtained through harassment and persistent pursuit , breached ... the [ PCC ] code of practice . ""
The PCC appears to have waited for a complaint to materialise : it could and should have intervened sooner .
There may be valid reasons why a person who is suffering from media intrusion is reluctant to make a formal complaint . ""
The Press Complaints Commission took too long to act to protect Kate Middleton from clear and persistent harassment . ""
Sir Christopher disagreed .
"" The committee has been a bit unfair , they have gone a bit too far , "" he said .
The PCC chairman otherwise praised the report , saying that its judgments against a privacy law and against statutory regulation of the press were landmarks .
He also agreed that lapses of the code were inevitable . ""
Of course it 's inevitable
we have a system of laws in this country just because this system of laws exists
does n't mean that there will not be crime , "" Sir Christopher said .
"" What I want to do is reduce to the absolute minimum possible breaches of the code of practice - that is what is our duty as a regulator . ""
I know that human beings being human beings , editors being editors , sooner or later someone is going to breach it .
If they did n't we would n't be in business . ""

2007-07-11,"The inheritance of public office is indefensible in the 21st century - but the treatment of Prince William and Kate Middleton shows it is also unfair to those doing the inheriting .
Let 's be clear , republicans object to the inheritance of public office on grounds of democratic principle .
Such an inheritance tells us that some are born superior , both socially and politically , that the country is not ours but is a kingdom there for the benefit of a certain elite of families and hangers - on .
It is fundamentally at odds with modern concepts of democracy .
However , it is clear for all to see that this bizarre feudal institution is also cruel and unfair to those caught up in it , whether by birth or by marriage .
The report this week of the Culture , Media and Sport Select Committee , which has claimed Kate Middleton was the victim of persistent media harassment , reminds us of the extent to which the institution of the monarchy damages the lives of those it touches .
Just as with Diana before her , the merest hint of a development in Ms Middleton 's relationship with William led to endless speculation in the press .
Even the BBC joined the fray - in typical BBC style - by giving what was essentially little more than the break - up of a relationship between two twentysomethings , headline coverage .
"" Experts "" and "" commentators "" were drafted in to dissect every last detail of the relationship that had ended thanks to the endless speculation ( at least , that 's what the endless speculation concluded ) .
This is not an isolated example .
Since the veil of secrecy and deference began to slip away from the Windsors back in the 1980s , the intrusions and pressures inflicted on them by the feudal rules and traditions of the monarchy , by the family itself and - in recent decades - by the relentless media spotlight put on them , has become ever more apparent .
The Diana saga and the failed marriage of Prince Andrew are the obvious examples .
Johann Hari 's excellent book , God Save the Queen ? , published in 2002 , made clear the extent to which the pressures and downright weird practices of "" royalty "" affected the whole family from an early age .
Christopher Hitchens summed it up in typical Hitchens style when he said : "" Here is the plain proof of the child - sacrifice that underlies our most absurd and sinister institution . ""
Still it continues .
Back in 2005 , when it was announced Charles wanted to re - marry , the nation watched with bemused amazement as the Windsors and their hapless advisors danced around in constitutional straightjackets .
They were deeply concerned about the legality of the proposed marriage , when and where it could take place and whether it was "" constitutionally appropriate "" for the mother of the groom to attend the ceremony .
They had to contend with a system in which a man in his 50s was required to ask the permission of his mother , the prime minister and the Archbishop of Canterbury before he could marry the woman he loves .
It is surely hard to claim that this is a fair and reasonable system , one that has a place in a modern democracy .
And now Charles ' adult children , William and Harry , can not pursue a career they are really interested in , they can not choose their faith , and they can not choose to be openly gay or to fall in love with a Catholic .
If William marries a Catholic girl he loses his inheritance .
This hardly reflects the values of modern Britain .
They are trapped in this royal circus as much as we are lumbered with it .
The absurdity of the monarchy means that , unlike any other public office , the future holders of that office are subject to the most invasive scrutiny from such a young age .
It was without any apparent irony that those who blamed the media for Diana 's death so quickly demanded that the 15-year - old William be immediately elevated to be next in line to the throne , with all the pressures and impositions that would entail .
And so it goes on .
William is probably at least 20 years away from the throne , potentially 40 years away ( if the throne lasts that long ) .
And yet the intrusions have already begun .
It might be difficult to feel sympathy for people who live such pampered lives , at the taxpayers ' expense - and no doubt if asked they would deny any desire to free themselves from this nonsense .
But can we in good conscience accept this highly personalised institution , one that is not only defective in principle , but which is also so harmful to those who occupy it ?
The inheritance of public office is indefensible in the 21st century - but the treatment of Prince William and Kate Middleton shows it is also unfair to those doing the inheriting ?"
2007-07-11,"Prince William 's on - off girlfriend , Kate Middleton , is the victim of "" clear and persistent harassment "" by the paparazzi and the Press Complaints Commission has failed to protect her , MPs said today .
The findings were part of the culture , media and sport select committee 's report on press self - regulation , in which MPs said that "" recent lapses in standards "" had damaged the image of the press .
But MPs concluded that self - regulation remained the best means of safeguarding press freedom .
The report cited lapsing standards in the case of Ms Middleton , who has protested on more than one occasion about being pursued by photographers in the street .
The Press Complaints Commission has been "" less than impressive "" in its response , according to the culture , media and sport select committee .
The situation came to a head in January , when Ms Middleton had to face a pack of photographers and news crew outside her London home amid mounting speculation that she and William were about to announce their engagement .
Three days later , the PCC circulated a letter from Ms Middleton 's solicitors claiming that their client was suffering from harassment and warning that a formal complaint would be made if editors continued to use material obtained from the paparazzi .
The select committee report said that there was no plausible public interest defence to justify the harassment .
"" We conclude that editors , in failing to take care not to use pictures of Kate Middleton obtained through harassment and persistent pursuit , breached ... the code of practice . ""
The PCC appears to have waited for a complaint to materialise .
It could and should have intervened sooner .
There may be valid reasons why a person who is suffering from media intrusion is reluctant to make a formal complaint . ""
The Press Complaints Commission took too long to act to protect Kate Middleton from clear and persistent harassment . ""
While the PCC "" was correct in bringing editors ' attention to the letter from the solicitors acting for Ms Middleton , it did so long after the worst abuses had occurred "" , the report went on .
In its submission to the committee , the PCC said it relied on information provided by the parties concerned when issuing "" desist "" notices .
But the committee said : "" The PCC should be readier to depart from its usual practice of issuing a desist notice only in response to a request "" .
The report used the case of Clive Goodman , the News of the World royal reporter , as a second case study .
Goodman was jailed for illegally accessing answerphone messages on phones belonging to members of the royal household .
The newspaper 's editor , Andy Coulson , resigned as a result of the case .
He recently took up a new post as the Conservative party 's director of communications and planning .
The select committee described the case as "" one of the most serious breaches of the code uncovered in recent times "" and observed that "" his actions have been rightly condemned "" .
Despite its criticisms , the committee concluded that self - regulation of the press should continue to avoid "" a very dangerous interference with the freedom of the press "" via the legal route .
The committee 's chairman , John Whittingdale , said : "" Self - regulation by the press is infinitely preferable to the alternative . ""
However , it must be seen to be effective if it is to survive .
Recent incidents have raised doubts about the extent to which editors and management are committed to strict enforcement of the rules .
The culture secretary , James Purnell , will now consider the report 's findings .
The director of the PCC , Tim Toulmin , said that the broad context of the findings were positive and recognised that the "" PCC can be successful when asked to intervene and stop harassment "" .
But he added that the PCC would not act without having been directed to do so by the person involved , in this case Ms Middleton .
He said : "" It is unfair to criticise us for not acting when we were not being asked to act .
But they paid us a backhanded compliment by recognising that we are effective when we do act . """
2007-07-27,"A warning to delinquents and the feckless : lock up your sons and daughters .
In Essex parkland usually graced by the rock bands and groupies of the music festival season , 40,000 brightly - clothed scouts from more than 160 countries will today celebrate 100 years of the movement when Prince William and the Duke of Kent open the 10-day World Scout Jamboree .
Yesterday , between munching apples , erecting tents and swapping woggles , Americans warmly greeted their French brethren and Scottish scouts delved into their sporrans to hand out pieces of tartan as the sound of young people singing in perfect harmony rose above Hylands Park , near Chelmsford .
From Surinam to Taiwan , from Serbia to Libya , teenagers of all religions and all races were united under the scout promise and a shared experience : being misunderstood at school .
"" My friends say that scouts are gay .
Everyone says that , "" reckoned Rebecca Harding , 15 , from south London . ""
A lot of people try to hide the fact they are scouts . ""
"" My friends do n't like it .
They say it is too tomboyish , "" added Sarah Burtt , 15 .
These 14- to 18-year - olds may be demonised for being good but they are determined to shrug off the dyb - dobbing , knot - tying stereotypes because , they declare , scouting is so much fun .
What about illicit booze ?
"" We do n't need it , "" said Sarah Chandler , 17 , from Colchester .
"" There 's so much excitement it 's really not necessary .
We 're not here to get drunk and stuff - we would n't remember any of it if we did . ""
Scouting is desperate to shrug off the misconceptions that still cling to it .
As a soldier , the founder , Robert Baden - Powell , had been so impressed with a brigade of small children who ran errands when he was besieged during the Boer war that in 1907 he gathered a group of 20 boys - from the working as well as the upper class - and took them camping on Brownsea Island in Dorset .
He wrote Scouting for Boys the following year .
It was an overnight sensation .
Within three years there were more than 100,000 scouts .
There are now 28 million across the world .
Although in parts anachronistic , Baden - Powell 's book is fourth in the all - time bestseller lists just behind the Bible , the Qur'an and Mao Zedong 's Little Red Book . ""
He started a great thing .
It fits all people , all races , all creeds , so he did something right , "" said Parker Vascik , a US scout from Virginia .
The US scouts sit in their mess tent experimenting with smoky bacon - flavoured crisps .
"" It tastes like a screwed - up barbecue , "" said one .
It may have begun as a God - fearing boys - only adventure club with proficiency badges in stopping runaway horses and bugling but it is now a genuinely co - educational , multicultural vision of global good citizenship .
Scouting has spread well beyond former colonies of the British empire .
There are also more Muslim scouts than Christians .
And the badges ?
Today 's scouts pick up qualifications in administration or public relations or circus skills .
"" I do not know how to tie any sort of knot , "" said Rosie Reynolds , 16 , from Eltham in south London .
"" I 'm not really ashamed of being a scout .
You do it for the community thing - everyone is automatically friends because you 're a scout . ""
The spirit of friendship is everywhere .
Scouts from all countries are high - fiving each other and welcoming people and inviting them to join games of football .
If anyone is a bit tired or homesick , "" you can go up to anyone and give them a hug , "" said Lizzie Harvey from Hampshire . ""
Young people to young people only , "" added Chris "" Fozzy "" Foster , the scout media officer , hurriedly .
During the 10-day , £ 20 m ( self - funded ) jamboree , the scouts will undertake traditional "" adventures "" : a day of water sports and a day doing voluntary work in the community , dredging ponds , picking up litter or entertaining the residents of old people 's homes .
But they will also spend time in workshops , engaged in role plays to understand climate change , refugees and HIV / Aids .
There will be drumming sessions with tuned plastic boomwhackers and doumbek skinned drums , arts and theatre and evening concerts .
Liberty X and Lemar have already entertained the scouts , who are using the hi - tech stage that will be handed over to the V music festival in three weeks ' time .
Is the jamboree really more enticing than a music festival ? ""
Do n't tell anyone - I 'm hiding out in the bushes for three weeks until the V festival , "" said Hannah Gray , 17 , from Aberdeenshire .
She went to another music festival recently .
"" It was very rushed .
This is so much more relaxed and all the people are the same age . ""
"" It 's a global adventure and a global experience , "" said Derek Twine , chief executive of the UK Scout Association .
UK membership has risen for three consecutive years and stands at 500,000 .
"" There 's been an enormous shift to empowering young people rather than providing activities for them . """

2007-08-31,"Prince Harry today led tributes to Diana , Princess of Wales , on the 10th anniversary of her death with a deeply emotional eulogy describing his mother as a "" guardian , friend and protector "" to him and Prince William . ""
She will always be remembered for her amazing public work , "" Harry told a memorial service at Guards Chapel , near Buckingham Palace , that was attended by the Queen , Prince Charles and around 500 others . ""
But behind the media glare , to us , just two loving children , she was quite simply the best mother in the world , "" he said , before adding with a slight smile : "" We would say that would n't we ? ""
Immediately afterwards , the bishop of London urged people to stop bickering about Diana 's memory , a reference in part to the persistent theory that the car crash in the early hours of August 31 1997 that killed Diana , Dodi Fayed and their driver Henri Paul was not an accident . ""
Still , 10 years after her tragic death , there are regular reports of fury at this or that incident , and the princess 's memory is used for scoring points , "" the Rt Rev Richard Chartres told the congregation . ""
Let it end here . ""
At times struggling to contain his emotions , Harry spoke of his and William 's feelings about the car crash .
"" It was an event which changed our lives forever , as it must have done for everyone who lost someone that night , "" he said .
"" We both think of her every day , "" said Harry , now 22 and an army officer .
"" We speak about her and laugh at all our memories . ""
The service , largely organised by the princes , was the centrepiece of a series of events marking the anniversary .
The day illustrated that the cult of Diana , while diminished , has by no means disappeared .
While crowds were slow to build outside Wellington Barracks , home to the Guards Chapel , by the time the Queen and Prince Philip arrived to loud cheers , people were pressed dozens deep against barriers along the pavement .
Even late in the afternoon a large throng was gathered around the gates of Kensington Palace , Diana 's former home and the site of the biggest outpouring of grief after her death .
Whatever the hopes of the bishop of London , William and Harry , many Britons refuse to accept Diana 's death was an accident - shortly before the service began a Channel 4 News poll was released showing that a quarter of Britons still believe Diana was murdered .
The conspiracy theories are most loudly and regularly expressed by Dodi 's father , Mohamed Al Fayed , who was not invited to the memorial service , although his daughter , Camilla Fayed , attended .
The Harrods owner maintains the crash was engineered by British intelligence officers and the royal family over fears Diana might marry Dodi , a Muslim .
Official investigations in both France and the UK concluded that the couple died because their driver was drunk , speeding and had not been trained to drive the heavy armoured Mercedes .
At 11 am , staff and shoppers at Harrods observed two minutes ' silence .
Mr Fayed stood with his head bowed as escalators , televisions and music were switched off .
Some of those inside said they believed Mr Fayed 's version of events .
"" There 's definitely something more to it than meets the eye and I think Mr Al Fayed is probably right that the government were involved , "" said Alison Wormall , who travelled from Nottinghamshire with her mother and two children for the tribute .
As well as Mr Fayed , also notably absent from the main service was the Duchess of Cornwall , who announced last week that she would stay away because her presence would be an unwelcome distraction .
Also not invited were Diana 's former butler Paul Burrell , and Patrick Jephson , her former private secretary , both of whom wrote gossipy books about their time with the princess .
Guests included the prime minister , Gordon Brown , and his wife , Sarah ; Tony and Cherie Blair ; and John Major , another former prime minister , who was a close friend of the princess .
The singers Cliff Richard , Elton John and Bryan Adams attended , and the photographer Mario Testino , along with representatives of dozens of charities supported by Diana , including groups helping vulnerable young people and those with HIV / Aids .
In his address , Mr Chartres spoke about Diana publicly shaking the hand of an Aids patient in 1987 when "" fear and prejudice "" surrounded the disease . ""
Those familiar with the field have no doubt that the princess played a significant part in overcoming a harmful and even a cruel taboo in a gesture which was not choreographed but sprung from a deep identification with those who were vulnerable and on the margin , "" he said .
The service also included some of the princess 's favourite pieces of classical music , as well as a hymn she particularly loved , I Vow To Thee , My Country .
The mood was intended to be as much a celebration of Diana 's life as a service of sombre remembrance , something reflected in the guests ' outfits , often closer to wedding than funeral attire .
William and Harry , who smiled broadly and laughed as they greeted people on the chapel steps , each wore a blue suit and coloured tie .
Others were more flamboyant - among them Ms Brown , dressed in a vivid lilac coat and matching feathered hat , and the colourfully dressed Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie .
The event is a chance for the princes - who were 15 and 12 when their mother died , and were a solemn , silent presence at her funeral - to remember her in their own way ."
2007-09-17,"One of the great advantages of the family history boom is that most of us have been obliged to give up what Freud called the "" family romance "" - the belief that we are related , a couple of generations back , to people richer , grander or cleverer than boring old us .
Finally letting go of the fantasy that Cleopatra was our eight - times - greatgranny or that we are the spit of the Duke of Wellington , the way is open for a set of less elevated , though actually more revealing , ways of understanding both the personal and public past .
According to a poll from Ancestry , an amateur genealogy website , you are far more likely to discover that your grandparents were n't married or your great uncle was married twice - but at the same time - than you are to learn that Prince William is your third cousin .
Dig below the topsoil of your current existence and chances are you will uncover a family tree that , far from being a sturdy oak , is actually an elm , riddled with illegitimacy , informal adoptions , changed names and convictions .
At first glance this might prove disappointing .
Not so much that there is n't a duke tucked away somewhere as that the scandals are so damn ordinary .
Being related to Jack the Ripper or Dick Turpin would confer a certain dark distinction .
Learning that most of your ancestors turned crispy in the Great Fire of London would at least give you the sense of being tied into the grand narrative of British history .
But discovering that they spent most of their time clinging to the perch of respectability , and sometimes falling off , is hardly the stuff dinner party anecdotes are made of .
It is , though , a great way of cutting through all the flabby rhetoric about "" how things were "" 50 or 100 years ago .
To listen to some people , including a fair number of politicians , you would be forgiven for thinking that not all that long ago people left their doors unlocked , young couples could n't wait to walk up
the aisle and men felt honour - bound to stand by girls they had got pregnant .
Instead , as the Ancestry findings show , people lived pretty much as they do today .
Family life was far from stable , with a high degree of illegitimacy and a fair amount of to - ing and fro - ing within the extended family .
( How else to account for all those name changes and secret adoptions ? )
The fact that 6 % of those polled learned that their parents were not married is surely striking ; genealogists tend to be at least 65 , which means that their parents were getting married ( or not ) in the 1930s , a period often peddled as one of pinching conformity .
A similar percentage found that their grandparents were not married , which pushes the focus back to the late Victorian age , not usually associated with sexual liberation ( think Mr Pooter ) .
These "" secrets "" about family members whom people have actually known and loved tells us a lot , not just about personal habits of reticence but about the parochialism of the recent past .
In the 1930s , for instance , five stops on the railway line was another world entirely , where you could contract a bigamous marriage , raise an illegitimate baby , or simply shake off your family name and start again ; a conviction for theft might be quietly shed by shifting into another county on release from prison .
The period from 1850 to 1950 was marked by a burgeoning mobility and an infant and sluggish media .
As a result it was possible for young people to keep one step ahead of the prying eyes of their native communities ( think of Jude and Sue Bridehead rattling round Wessex branch lines ) .
Now we are catching up with our recent ancestors , thanks to all the documentation ( civil registers , the census ) online .
And what those family members are telling us , crucially , is that their lives were really no different from ours - and that , by extension , we have nothing much to be ashamed of .

2007-09-20,"What greater shock could befall a down - to - earth Yorkshire couple than to find their son suddenly speaking with a grand RP accent ?
This is what has happened to Mr and Mrs McCartney - Moore from York , whose 10-year - old son , William , speech - impaired after brain surgery , eventually spoke again , but with a voice like Brian Sewell 's .
More than a month after an operation to remove an abscess from his brain , William was taken by his parents on a seaside holiday in Northumberland where he suddenly uttered his first words : "" Look , I 've made a saand caastle . ""
Yorkshiremen regard their accent , like their brass bands , as central to their sense of identity , and they try never to lose it .
Decades of consorting with the chattering classes in London have done nothing to alter the way of speaking of either William Hague or Alan Bennett .
But that apart , nobody nowadays wants to have a posh accent .
Even the children of the aristocracy go to great pains to proletarianise their speech .
For to talk like a member of the royal family - and William 's parents likened his accent to the Queen 's - is taken as a sign of effeteness , buffoonery and alienation from the new Britain .
Nobody knows why William underwent this disturbing change , and the explanation offered by one prominent brain surgeon does not sound convincing .
"" It 's as if he 's relearned how to talk from listening to language from sources different to those that prompted his speech first time round , "" said Paul Eldridge of the Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Liverpool .
But what sources could these have been ?
William remained after his operation in the bosom of his Yorkshire - speaking family , and even if he had spent his time listening to radio and television , he would have heard very few examples of "" BBC English "" .
William , says his mother , has no idea that his accent has changed and thinks he is speaking normally .
That is a relief , but let 's pray he is treated with the tolerance he deserves . ·
The publishers of Cherie Blair 's forthcoming autobiography promise us it will be "" intimate "" and revealing , but I ca n't get excited about it .
While Mrs Blair remains an enigma , it is most unlikely that she will give satisfactory answers to the questions that puzzle us .

But will she tell us what turned her from an exemplary socialist into a craver for wealth , from a friend of the poor into a sponger of the rich , from a clever and sensible woman into a sucker for a lifestyle guru and her crooked boyfriend ?
Her book , we are told , will be a "" full account "" of her journey from a working - class childhood in Liverpool to No 10 Downing Street . ""
So much has happened , "" she said in explanation of her decision to write it , "" that it feels wrong somehow just to let it pass as if the journey had no meaning .
"" It sounds as if that meaning still eludes her and that she hopes that writing the book will help her find it .
But if she does n't know the meaning now , I doubt she ever will . ·
Greatly as they have suffered , the McCann family have done their country a service by providing it with an endless topic of conversation .
Not since the death of Princess Diana has there been a single subject of such consuming interest to everybody .
Kate and Gerry McCann should be regarded as martyrs in the cause of uniting a fragmented society .
I , for one , have found them incredibly useful on social occasions when I have found myself talking to people I do not know and with whom I fear I may have nothing in common .
I need only ask them what they think of the McCann business , and I can be sure of a long and animated reply .
Not many people warm to Mr and Mrs McCann .
Most find them cold and priggish .
Some feel that they court publicity , that they could avoid the photographers rather more than they do .
Others are suspicious of the size of Mrs McCann 's wardrobe and think she changes her clothes too often .
A few have developed an aversion to Cuddle Cat and support the otherwise maligned Portuguese police in their reported desire to confiscate it .
But I have as yet met nobody who thinks that the McCanns bear any responsibility for the disappearance of their daughter Madeleine , apart perhaps from their failure to hire a babysitter .
The DNA , the cadaver dogs and all the other scraps of evidence against them strike everyone as worthless .
How the Portuguese police can ever have thought differently is a great mystery .
· You 've got to admire pigeons .
Ever since I can remember , strenuous efforts have been made to eliminate them from their two most famous urban habitats : Trafalgar Square in London and St Mark 's Square in Venice .
The authorities have tried everything from feeding them contraceptives to electrifying their perches .
But they continue to survive and multiply , to the general happiness of visitors who do not know or care about the threats they pose to human health or the damage they cause to buildings with their corrosive droppings .
Already in Trafalgar Square , feeding the pigeons is an offence , and now in Venice the mayor has resorted to the desperate measure of banning the Italian tradition of throwing rice as confetti at weddings , on the grounds that pigeons like to eat it .
You can be almost certain that this wo n't make the slightest difference .

2007-10-05,"Prince William and Kate Middleton yesterday complained of being "" aggressively "" chased in their car by paparazzi - days after the start of the inquest into the death of Princess Diana in a fatal crash while being followed by photographers .
Pictures of the couple together , for the first time since their relationship temporarily ended , emerged yesterday after they left a London nightclub together in the early hours .
Clarence House said William had been concerned by the "" threatening behaviour "" of photographers who pursued the pair on motorcycles and in cars .
Spokesman Paddy Harverson said the timing was "" incomprehensible "" , given the continuing inquest into the death of the prince 's mother and Dodi Fayed in 1997 .
Mr Harverson said : "" Prince William was concerned by the threatening behaviour of the paparazzi in London .
Having already been photographed leaving the club , he and Kate Middleton were then pursued in his car by photographers on motorcycles , in vehicles and on foot .
The aggressive pursuit was potentially dangerous and worrying for them .
It seems incomprehensible , particularly at this time , that this behaviour is still going on . ""
Mr Harverson said the matter has been raised with the Press Complaints Commission .
In a statement the PCC said that while freelance photographers are not directly regulated by the organisation , editors must not publish photographs which are taken through harassment .
"" It can of course be difficult for editors to establish the exact circumstances in which a photograph is taken , "" said the PCC .
"" But it is of the utmost importance not to use photographs which have been taken in a manner that may have compromised the safety of individuals , which may include pursuit in vehicles . ""
Late last night the Daily Mail was reported to have removed a paparazzi photograph from its front page , substituting a shot of the couple watching rugby .
Speculation surrounding the on - off relationship of the second - in - line to the throne and the young woman who could one day be queen has sparked the same media furore which haunted the young Diana Spencer during her engagement to Prince Charles .
The couple met at St Andrews University , but ended their four year relationship in April following increasing pressure from the media .
Ms Middleton even contacted the PCC over alleged harassment after the Daily Mirror published a picture of her walking to work .
Over the summer rumours circulated that the pair had rekindled their relationship after they were spotted at the same public events .
Ms Middleton was in the royal box for the two princes ' concert at Wembley in memory of their mother , although she sat apart from William .
Early yesterday morning they were seen leaving London 's Boujis nightclub in South Kensington .
Although the couple appeared smiling and happy in the printed pictures , Clarence House said they had later become alarmed at the relentless pursuit by photographers .
During Diana 's inquest , which began on Tuesday , the jury has heard how photographers pursued the princess 's Mercedes in cars and on motorbikes before the fatal crash in a tunnel on August 31 1997 .
After the pictures of William and Ms Middleton , both 25 , were published yesterday , bookies William Hill closed betting on the pair becoming engaged ; a spokesman said : "" As far as we are concerned it is no longer a question of if they get married but when . """
2007-10-06,"Prince William was described yesterday as ' deeply saddened ' at the death of his ' good friend ' and former platoon commander at Sandhurst .
Major Alexis Roberts , 32 , was killed in a roadside explosion in southern Afghanistan last Thursday and is the most senior Army officer to die in the country since the conflict began in 2001 .
The Prince said last night his thoughts were with Major Roberts ' wife and their two young daughters . '
At this time , his thoughts and prayers are with Lex 's wife , Susie , their two young daughters , Alice and Freya , and with all his family and friends , ' a statement from Clarence House read .
He is the second friend William , a second lieutenant in the Household Cavalry , has lost in action this year .
Last April , the prince 's fellow Blenheim Company cadet Joanna Dyer , 24 , died in Iraq .
Major Roberts ' widow issued a statement saying : ' Lex was my best friend , the most wonderful husband and deeply loving father to Alice and Freya . '
He died doing the job he loved and I had just received a letter from him saying how much good he felt he was doing for the people of Afghanistan and how proud he was to be part of the Royal Gurkha Rifles . '
I am overwhelmed by the support from our family and friends and the positive impact Lex had on people 's lives .
I hope that the media will respect my strong wish for privacy for me and my daughters at this time . '
Roberts , from Kent , was serving with the 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles and returning to Kandahar airfield after fighting in Helmand province when he died after an improvised explosive device was detonated .
It is the first death in Afghanistan of a soldier serving with the Gurkhas and takes the number of British troops killed in Afghanistan to 82 .
The defence secretary , Des Browne , said Roberts was ' an extremely experienced officer who was , quite obviously , held in high regard by his superiors , peers and those who worked for him . '
My heart goes out to his family and friends as they come to terms with their loss . '
Major Roberts ' commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel Jonny Bourne , added : ' The British Army has lost one of its finest prospects and the nation has lost a dedicated servant , a demonstrably warm - hearted man of profound integrity and courage - quite simply , a very special human being . '
Roberts , and two soldiers who were injured , were returning to base after taking part in Operation Palk Wahel - ' hammer blow ' - an offensive into the region 's notorious ' Green Zone ' in Helmand 's Upper Gereshk Valley ."
2007-10-10,"The Mail on Sunday editor , Peter Wright , has criticised photographers who hound Prince William and his girlfriend Kate Middleton .
Days after Clarence House asked editors not to use pictures of the couple obtained as a result of harassment , Mr Wright said it was "" not right "" that paparazzi should follow the couple around the clock .
However , he said pictures of Prince Harry emerging from nightclubs in the early hours of the morning were fair game .
"" It is a difficult area - one person 's freedom of expression is another person 's invasion of privacy , "" Mr Wright told the House of Lords select committee on communications today .
"" I think this is something we all have to look at very carefully .
I have been giving a lot of thought over the last year to the situation of Prince William and Kate Middleton
and I think there is a strong case that photographers following somebody all day every day whatever they are doing is not right , "" he added .
"" We do not commission photographers to do that .
We do not use pictures taken in that way . ""
But if you are second in line to the throne and you go to a nightclub with your girlfriend and you come out and you are drunk and pictures are taken
I think it 's a different matter .
These are always going to be difficult questions . ""
Following the appeal by Clarence House late last Friday night , the Mail on Sunday 's sister paper , the Daily Mail , replaced a "" pap "" picture of Prince William and Middleton leaving a nightclub with a more sober picture of them enjoying a rugby match .
But the pictures of the couple leaving Boujis in Kensington ran in The Sun and the London Evening Standard .
Mr Wright said in some areas people 's privacy was more respected than it was three decades ago . ""
A newspaper does not carry a story about someone 's health without them expressly approving it , "" he said .
"" That would not have happened 25 or 30 years ago . ""
He also defended his paper 's use of free CD and DVD giveaways , which he said had boosted the paper 's circulation in a declining market .
"" We pioneered the use of CDs and DVDs as a promotional tool and we have tried hard to maintain the quality and come up with new ideas , "" he said .
Mr Wright added that the paper 's circulation had been "" broadly stable "" for the past 10 years and "" ahead a little bit "" over the past 12 months .
"" That is in a market that has dropped by 5 % or 6 % so I am pleased that we are in that position , "" he said .
Mr Wright added that the covermount giveaways , which have included the new CD by Prince , was an experiment that had "" paid off "" .

2007-10-14,"One moment we 're in Paris , watching a reconstruction of events 10 years ago .

Answer : neither .
Toeing a Press Complaints Commission line , Fleet Street does n't use snoop - and - stalk snaps ; and when something misses that mark , editors retreat .

Of course , there 's a job to do preaching the case for restraint further afield .
Summon Richard Desmond or Rupert Murdoch .
But restraint is a two - way street .
When the Mail on Sunday editor says that Prince Harry , blotto outside a nightclub , is news , he has a point .
William inside Boujis with his rekindled love ?
Off limits , because general gawpers would n't get past the doorman .
Driving home with her afterwards ?
Ditto : you must n't condone pursuit .
But the rule of thumb says that what Joe Public can see for himself ca n't and should n't be ' private ' .
And common sense might add that high - profile military officers would be better taking their girlfriend to the movies more often than racing through Mayfair at 2 am on another wild chase after fuzzy fame on some Italian newsstand ."
2007-10-30,"Exxon Mobil has won the right to appeal against a $ 2.5bn ( £ 1.2bn ) bill for one of the most infamous environmental disasters , when one of its tankers ran aground off Alaska and polluted 1,300 miles of coastline .
The US supreme court agreed yesterday to hear the case against the record damages that were awarded to victims of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in March 1989 , the worst in American history .
A federal appeals court had already halved the $ 5bn damages originally awarded by a jury in 1994 , five years after the accident at Prince William Sound , Alaska .
But Exxon , which reported the highest - ever annual net profits last year at $ 40bn , has refused to accept that even that payment was fair .
The supreme court judges said they would consider whether the company should have to pay any punitive damages at all , while Exxon said it would argue that $ 2.5bn was excessive under laws governing shipping and previous high court decisions limiting punitive damages .
The case is expected to be heard by March , with judgment likely in June .
The oil company has taken heart from the court 's last ruling on punitive damages - in February it set aside a near-$80 m judgment against Philip Morris , awarded to the widow of a smoker in Oregon .
Exxon has pointed out it has paid $ 3.4bn in clean - up costs and other penalties from the spill , which killed hundreds of thousands of sea birds and marine animals . ""
This case has never been about compensating people for actual damages .
Rather it is about whether further punishment is warranted ...
We do not believe any punitive damages are warranted in this case , "" Tony Cudmore , a company spokesman , said in a statement .
Lawyers for the plaintiffs , including 33,000 commercial fishermen , said the damages award was "" barely more than three weeks of Exxon 's net profits "" .
The company argued it should not be held responsible for the mistakes of the ship 's captain , Captain Joseph Hazelwood , who admitted drinking vodka before boarding the vessel but was acquitted of operating a ship while intoxicated .
The plaintiffs said Exxon knew Mr Hazelwood had sought treatment for drinking and had started drinking again .
Exxon shares were up 2 % to $ 93.82 in early trading in New York yesterday ."
2007-11-12,"Many that were young this time last year will not grow old , as those that are left grow old .
Prince William , joining his family to lay a wreath for the first time at the Cenotaph in London , as Remembrance Sunday fell poignantly on the actual 11th day of the 11th month , was among those painfully conscious that the rollcall which the memorial calls "" the glorious dead "" is still inexorably lengthening .
An elegant figure in scarlet - lined military greatcoat , taller than his grandmother or father , than the slight figure of the once formidable Lady Thatcher , taller even than the Rev Ian Paisley .
Like many at services around the country , Prince William 's thoughts must have been more immediate than that remote past when the first Cenotaph was lashed up in timber .
Only last month his instructor from Sandhurst , Major Alexis Roberts , was killed in action in southern Afghanistan , and earlier this year a friend , Second Lieutenant Joanna Yorke Dyer , died in Iraq .
In Afghanistan , where more than 80 British soldiers have died in the last six years , Royal Marines from 40 Commando held a service in Helmand province .
Lance Corporal Jake Alderton , whose family said he wanted to be a soldier from the age of 10 , but who died on Friday , will have been more vivid than ghostly regiments swamped in the mud of Passchendaele 90 years ago .
Private Jamie Cooper checked out of hospital to attend the ceremony in Bristol .
At 18 , he was the youngest soldier seriously injured in Iraq , when he was shredded last year by a mortar attack in Basra .
He is probably facing life in a wheelchair , from that and a string of hospital infections in Britain .
Afterwards Cooper said he was "" proud but tired "" .
His father , who said the family will continue fighting for better compensation than the £ 57,000 offered , added : "" We always came here when he was a child , but now he can reflect on his own experiences .
He was thinking about the friends and colleagues he lost in Iraq . ""
At St Mary 's church in Rye , East Sussex , the congregation was joined by Corporal Will Rigby , who last June held the hand of his twin brother , hit by a roadside bomb near Basra , until John died on what would have been their 24th birthday .
He was the 153rd British serviceman to die in Iraq .
Afterwards , Rigby watched as his twin 's name was uncovered on the town memorial .
In Liverpool , a Douglas DC-3 Dakota plane , itself a D - Day veteran , scattered 300,000 biodegradable poppy petals .
Lord mayor Paul Clark said : "" A few decades ago it was felt that these remembrance services were something to do with history , but now we know with Iraq and Afghanistan that sadly we are losing troops at this moment . ""
The Armed Forces Memorial in Staffordshire , formally opened by the Queen last month , held its first remembrance ceremony .
It already has over 16,000 inscribed names of men and women who have died in war or by terrorist action since 1948 , but has space left for almost as many more .
In Whitehall , what was once a regiment of Bevin Boys
, conscripted to keep the coal pouring out of British mines to fuel the war effort , was reduced to seven sparse rows of men .
A small group of Falkland veterans led the parade to mark the 25th anniversary of that war , while others made the journey back to join in the ceremonies there .
Just as the gun boomed from Hyde Park to launch the two - minute silence , a voice bellowed a tirade at Gordon Brown : the substance was incomprehensible , but the parade ground timbre unmistakable .
Afterwards many expressed astonishment that young men terribly injured in Iran and Afghanistan were refused permission to join the Cenotaph parade , on the grounds that they were serving men , not veterans .
"" It 's disgusting , this should be a ceremony for anyone willing to give the time for their country , "" Paul Newton said .
An RAF veteran of Bosnia and other combat zones
, he was a standard bearer for the British Legion at the Albert Hall , and is now a mental health nurse .
"" It has n't turned out very well , really , "" Joan Marshall said , standing opposite the Cenotaph .
She was evacuated to Northampton in the second world war , while both her parents worked for the fire service in east London at the peak of the Blitz .
Her son came back in one piece from serving with the navy in the Falklands war . ""
Wars now just go on and on , without doing any good .
I think they 'll just have to bring them all home , "" she said ."
2007-11-18,"The tabloid obsession with the doomed romance of Prince Harry and Chelsy Davy reveals how fixated people are by the concept of The One .
There has been dismay , disbelief and hand - wringing over the break - up of their three - year relationship .
You 'd think everyone would have got it out of their system with the tears spilled for Prince William and Kate Middleton , who got back together a few months later anyway .
What 's so surprising about a 19-year - old girl and a 20-year - old boy splitting up ?
Every social trend points away from long - term commitment at any age , let alone for the under - twenties .
Divorce rates are sky high , marriage at an all - time low .
With sex texting , readily available one - night stands and binge drinking , it 's a marvel any relationship lasts longer than two hours .
Break - ups are not remotely shocking and pretending otherwise involves extreme denial .
The less successful a society becomes at marriage and long - term commitment , the more desperate people are to believe in the happily ever after they so rarely witness .
So the more ridiculously enthusiastic they are about the idea of someone meeting The One in their late teens and staying with them for ever .
One person must be greatly cheered by such romantic optimism .
Sixty years ago this week , aged 21 , the Queen married her second cousin once removed .
Her subjects seem determined to marry off her grandsons at the earliest opportunity , handkerchiefs at the ready .
You could n't dream up a better anniversary present than this vindication of the Queen 's beliefs .
BBC2 's Arrange Me a Marriage , starting on Thursday , claims that love is overrated and your family is best placed to find you a life partner , a view apparently increasingly common among lovelorn thirty- and fortysomethings who have failed to meet someone via the usual random routes .
Presenter Aneela Rahman , veteran of a 14-year arranged marriage , will reveal how this is the way forward .
It is how the royal family has done it for generations ."
2007-11-25,"It was never exactly going to rival the World Cup , this strange little Prince William Cup , but it underlined a few of the bare essentials of the events of last month .
The Springboks are the best side in the world , and Wales are a pretty side with no platform .
This was a chance for Wales to launch the latest in a long line of fresh starts .
They had lost to Fiji in France , had lost their coach , Gareth Jenkins , and now had to impress Warren Gatland , watching in New Zealand .
Perhaps the new coach had guessed that it might be better to keep his distance for the moment .
The World Cup had , after all , exposed some fairly gruesome problems in the Wales set piece .
Not a lot has been happening on the home front since then to suggest that any great reconstruction is under way .
So , it was no real surprise to see the Wales scrum in trouble from the outset .
True , the Springbok line - out was n't quite what it was when Victor Matfield was soaring in France , but to have control up front simply meant the South Africans were bound to win .
If there was another echo of the World Cup final against England it was their defence .
Never has a rugby side looked so comfortable without the ball .
Schalk Burger ran around like a dervish , but the rest of them lined up in their collective line of blitz defenders and charged with deliberation .
Wales did some delicate slipping of the ball and managed to cross for two tries , one in each half , from an equally subtle kicking game , but it was fine lacework buried in a great overcoat of leather .
Gavin Henson provided some high - quality touches .
As did James Hook .
Morgan Stoddart played with confidence and elusiveness , and thoroughly deserved his try when he leapt highest to reclaim a little chip from Hook .
But these were just moments of forward motion against a backdrop of being thumped the other way .
Of failed line - outs .
Of too little too late .
The first Wales try - by Colin Charvis , who equalled the world record of 22 tries for a forward - came at the end of the first half , when the home side had already leaked three tries .
And the second came when everything was done and dusted .
South Africa absorbed all the fancy running of their opponents with patience .
They were quite happy to yield possession and even territory .
They even managed to survive two periods of being down to 14 players for 10 minutes without being seriously stretched .
In fact , their seven - man pack made a mess of Wales after the home team had opted for a scrum , with Albert van den Berg in the bin for preventing release at a ruck .
The closer Wales got to the Springboks ' line , the more ferocious the defence .
Albert 's gone - no problem , we 'll shove harder .
Bismarck du Plessis is off - no matter , we 'll pile in for him .
It is a rare fanaticism that speaks volumes about rugby in South Africa .
Patience on the back foot , followed by the surge in attack .
The moment they did have the ball , they swapped aligned discipline for a forward gear of animated cruelty .
The physical appetite was always in evidence , but they surged forward with a directness that contrasted with Wales 's stuttering , sliding probes .
Line - out , midfield interchange , inside pass , break , try .
So very simple .
South Africa won the line - outs and hit hard .
Nothing complicated , although Francois Steyn was always trying something a little more extravagant than Jaque Fourie , for example .
On such a day , it was the simple centre who scored a brace of tries .
Steyn was a little too Welsh in his thinking to be as effective .
With all this ball and all this instinct for running straight , South Africa have long been able to put out outstanding back - row forwards .
Burger 's work - rate spoke for itself , but Juan Smith was only just less evident and the new bloke , Ryan Kankowski , showed huge promise .
Another great big , rapid No 8 to provide back - up to Danie Rossouw and Pierre Spies - just what the rest of the world needs .
The trouble for Wales is that they have young forwards of real potential .
Like Alun Wyn Jones and Ian Evans for example .
But their apprenticeship will have to be short .
They need to be up and running - or more preferably , jumping - right now .
In Wales , nothing is clear .
To go into this game with a caretaker coach in Nigel Davies sort of sums everything up .
Welsh rugby is in limbo .
The only thing you can say is that at least Warren Gatland has time on his hands to improve things before the next World Cup .
Mind you
, it looks as if he will need every second of the three years and 10 months he has got .
If he lasts that long he will have broken all known Welsh records .
It is , as they say down here , a challenge .

2007-12-17,"Wetherby Prep , one of Britain 's most exclusive private schools , has changed hands in a multi - million pound deal .
The Notting Hill - based school , whose former pupils include Princes William and Harry , is run by Alpha Plus , which has now been sold by private equity investor Sovereign Capital .
Sovereign Capital bought Alpha five years ago for £ 26 m and has made a substantial profit on its investment , with today 's sale understood to be worth more than £ 100 m .
Other famous former pupils of Wetherby include Hugh Grant , writer Julian Fellowes and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber .
Among its current pupils are Liz Hurley 's son Damian .
Alpha is one of the largest groups of independent schools in the UK .
It has grown from 11 to 17 schools over the past five years , covering nursery to sixth form , and includes Pembridge Hall prep school for girls , and the Cliff School in Wakefield .
Pupil numbers have increased by 44 % to around 2,800 through both organic and acquisitive growth and it currently has a further two schools under development .
The business is being bought by Delancey , the property firm run by Jamie Ritblat .
Mr Ritblat said : "" We look forward to building on the impressive reputation of Alpha Plus and adding our real estate expertise to the excellent educational and management credentials that have been developed under Sovereign 's ownership . """
2007-12-17,"It was n't a year of big stories :
no terrorist attacks in Europe or the US , no assassinations , no new wars , no royal deaths and , though a prime minister fell , he did so in slow motion - giving way to a successor who had promotion sewn up 13 years ago .
Rather , it was a year of big stories that did n't quite happen : the east of England did n't get flooded , Glasgow airport did n't get blown up , Gillian Gibbons did n't get flogged , Gordon Brown did n't call an election , George Bush did n't bomb Iran , Lord Levy did n't get put in the dock ( still less Tony Blair ) , Prince William did n't get engaged ( and did n't , in the end , dump his girlfriend ) , and even Conrad Black has n't gone to jail -
yet .
I am tempted to add that Muslim terrorists did n't commit their annually promised - promised by newspapers , I mean , not Muslims - Christmas outrage .
But , as I write , there are still 10 outraging days left to Christmas .
As other stories failed to meet expectations , the year was dominated by a four - year - old child .
More than seven months after her disappearance in Portugal , Madeleine McCann still made the front pages - and not only in the obsessive Express .
There is no precedent for a story of this type enjoying such prominence for so long .
True , the kidnapping and murder of Charles Lindbergh 's baby son in 1932 was scarcely out of the papers for four years .
But Lindbergh was a celebrity , and his story had narrative momentum : a ransom demand , the discovery of a body , an arrest , a trial and an execution .
In the McCann case , nothing significant has happened since May.
Almost everything written since then has been based on speculation and , dare I say it , invention .
When their inventiveness dried up , the papers fell back on asking themselves why they were so interested in the case - "" commentary on the commentary "" , as Matthew Parris called it in the Times last week .
What explains the unrelenting , saturation coverage ?
Interest is not confined to Britain ; when I wrote about the McCanns before , I received requests for interviews from a dozen or so overseas media , all desperate for fresh angles .
The answer surely lies in reader demand .
Most parents have experienced the McCanns ' quandary of how long to let small children out of your sight , if at all .
The lack of reliable information further enhanced the story , allowing every reader to play the sleuth , in a grisly , real - life version of Cluedo - with no theory , including a conspiracy ( the Tapas Nine ) , too outlandish to be considered .
For months , cyberspace has been full of this stuff .
The traditional sources of editors ' knowledge about "" what people are talking about "" were their chauffeurs and domestic servants .
A casual aside by the cleaning lady could send a dozen reporters scurrying across the country .
Now , thanks to the internet , editors can stay permanently tuned to national , even international , gossip .
If you do n't like what 's in the papers , blame the readers , not the journalists .
Only in the final weeks of the year did a story emerge that seemed to grip the public as much as the missing Madeleine .
Once again , everyone could play the sleuth in the tale of John "" canoe man "" Darwin and his wife Anne .
One single mother in Merseyside joined in so successfully that , from a few simple internet searches , she found the photo of the Darwins in Panama which had eluded Fleet Street 's finest , to say nothing of Cleveland police .
She passed the story to the Daily Mirror in what was probably the biggest triumph so far for "" citizen journalism "" .
What concerned me was the newspapers ' continuing flouting of the contempt laws .
Taken literally , the Contempt of Court Act 1981 - designed to ensure jurors are not prejudiced when defendants come to trial - applies from the moment of arrest .
Yet even after Darwin was charged , the speculation about his missing years and his financial affairs continued .
As for humanity 's survival , global warming continued its slow ascent up the news agenda .
Most papers still give space to global warming deniers - mostly ideological right - wingers who presumably think life wo n't be worth living anyway if we have to impose restraints on capitalism - but scepticism has largely disappeared from news pages .
One effect of James Murdoch 's move to take charge of the News International papers , I suspect , will be further to strengthen green coverage in the Times and Sun - it was James who persuaded Dad to take the subject seriously .
Even the Daily Mail has more or less stopped mocking the doom mongers , while its sister paper , the London Evening Standard , has a page on green issues each day .
But because humans are not hard - wired to worry about dangers 50 or 100 years away , global warming rarely makes the front page - except in the Independent , which probably thinks it is writing for a more highly evolved species anyway .
If there had been newspapers on the prehistoric savannah , they would have headlined the threats from lions , tigers and other predators ( "" 2,000 poised to strike "" ) ; those ubiquitous Muslim terrorists are the modern equivalent .
So , again , if newspapers do n't report climate change properly , blame readers , not journalists .
Finally , Iraq .
As James Forsyth , the Spectator 's online editor , pointed out in this section last week , the story slipped steadily down the news agenda in 2007 .
I am not sure , though , that Forsyth is right when he accuses the British press of under - reporting the success of Bush 's military surge .
Success is relative : the "" flood "" of returning refugees is based on unreliable figures ( the Iraqi government counts everybody crossing the border , even if they 've been on a day trip ) and the country remains , as one reporter puts it , "" uniquely dangerous "" .
All we know for certain is that fewer US soldiers are being killed and fewer big car bombs are going off in Baghdad .
More than ever , we need reporters to get out and about .
As Forsyth acknowledges , conditions make that hard .
But would editors be interested ?
I doubt it .
We made a desert and , since we could hardly call it peace , we called it an old story .
The brutal truth is that , while almost every reader of a British paper can imagine what it 's like to have your child disappear on holiday or to want to fake your death and start afresh , few can imagine what it 's like to be an Iraqi ."

As told to Barney Ronay"
2008-02-02,"If you were trying to think of a suitable career for a future heir to the throne it would be difficult to come up with one more improbable than journalism - never mind for a royal whose mother was hounded by the fourth estate and whose father holds it in thinly veiled contempt .
But if senior Clarence House courtiers have their way Prince William will follow his spells in each of the armed services with a shorter one next year in the newsroom of a national newspaper .
The brief taste of life in the media is one of a series of "" work experience "" placements being discussed as part of a plan to prepare the prince for public life - and ultimately the throne .
While he is unlikely to join the ratpack or the paparazzi waiting for the appearance of his girlfriend , Kate Middleton , the Clarence House plan raises the possibility that soon his byline , presumably William Wales , will appear on something other than the court circular .
One person involved in the decision - making said : "" I think it would be a good idea for him to find out how the media works .
It 's something I would like to see him do . ""
The prince , who has already served in the army , is currently undergoing training with the RAF in Lincolnshire to become a pilot and later this year will spend time with the Royal Navy .
After that , advisers are keen for him to undertake a range of training in civilian life , to complete his education in how the country he will one day rule operates . ""
He 's learned about the armed forces , "" the official said , "" now he has to learn about the state . ""
Among the options is spending time at the Foreign Office or in a government department to watch the civil service at work - though not Downing Street , where he would potentially be embroiled in partisan political issues - or in sport , the legal profession , or even the Church of England , of whose faith he will one day be defender .
Clarence House insisted yesterday that no decisions had been taken and concentration was still on the prince 's military career .
We know pretty well what Prince Charles thinks of the media - at a press call in Switzerland three years ago he famously described the BBC 's inoffensive royal correspondent , Nicholas Witchell , as ghastly .
But officials think inside knowledge of how the folk who will inevitably dog him for the rest of his life actually operate might prove beneficial .
But if the plan for William 's work experience as a member of the media goes ahead , courtiers will face a ticklish question : at which paper ?
Although one official refused to rule out a spell at a tabloid , such a choice would be littered with potential pitfalls , not least in ensuring undying enmity from the thwarted rival . Mid - market papers such as the Daily Mail have grown stridently hostile to his father , while the Daily Express remains stuck in the time - warp of Diana - olatry , reminding its ageing readership what William 's mother used to look like by regularly placing her photograph on its front page .
With the Independent and Financial Times spurning royal coverage , that would seem to leave the Times , Daily Telegraph and Guardian .
Courtiers retain a soft spot for the posh people 's paper , still regarding the Times as the voice of the establishment , while the Telegraph , the most ostentatiously obsequious , seems to receive few editorial favours from the palace for its loyalty , though the Queen is known to enjoy the crossword so much that she once complained when it was moved .
Both papers , however , are edited by former colleagues of Paddy Harverson , Prince Charles 's press officer .
Could the Guardian , favoured by figures as diverse as Jason Bourne and Harold Shipman , be in the running ?
Moderately republican in outlook
- hence perhaps less slavish and more independent - we do at least share an interest in some of the prince 's environmental and social issues , such as housing ."
2008-02-17,"Could it be that the current wave of British youth delinquency is largely in the eye of the beholder ?
It certainly seems to be the cause du jour - headlines about ' Binge Britain ' , campaigns to stop underage drinking and stories about ex - soldiers being drafted into classrooms as teachers .
Then the dark stuff : ' happy slappers ' locked up for filming fatal beatings ; fathers stabbed ; broken bottles brandished in a club frequented by Prince William .
To view all this is to visualise a Britain that makes the violent excesses of A Clockwork Orange resemble a nursery outing in Balamory .
While fictional miscreants are one thing , from Graham Greene 's Brighton gangs , and the tribal clash of Quadrophenia , through to the pretty - boy warfare of West Side Story , the real deal is quite another .
The question is , are we genuinely seeing the dawn of the new yobbery or is it just youth - business as usual , spotlit and overreported , for the titillated masses ?
Let 's be clear about one thing : genuine antisocial behaviour is not a ' youth thing ' , it is a ' crime thing ' .
It is not only the young who indulge in antisocial , homicidal or psychopathic behaviour , though they are the only ones who get grouped together .
Odd when you think about it .
When older people commit crimes , we do not ring 5 Live ranting about a ' middle - aged crime wave ' .
Why , then , are ' teenage louts ' in Blackpool automatically twinned with ' young thugs ' in Luton ?
Moreover , what can really be so ' new ' about a culture documented by Alan Parker 's borstal - set Scum as early as 1979 ?
It seems to me that one of the bittersweet by - products of ageing is a tendency towards rosy - specs revisionism about not only one 's own youthful conduct , but also the behaviour of one 's entire generation .
As in : ' We were n't angels , but we were never as bad as that ' , followed by a pause as we gaze back fondly on our young selves - lying in meadows , say , sipping Panda Pops .
In truth , all generations have had their fair share of drinking , smoking , drugging , shagging , fighting and general miscreant carryings - on .
And even when not behaving in a delinquent manner , we were scaring the bejesus out of older people without realising it - by the very fact of our existence .
It 's all in the framing .
When my friends and I thought we were so cool in the 80s , lurking outside Tower Records with the boys with the soaped mohawks , it did n't occur to us that we probably unsettled nine out of 10 passersby .
The same goes for every generation - from the Brylcreemed Teds through to the hoodies on street corners .
While looking terrifying on the outside , on the inside and to each other , these youths are not scary at all .
Nor are they ' new ' .
Where teens are concerned - cider - sozzled degenerates , leaning against walls , holding spitting competitions are veritable design classics - they 've been around forever .
If you want ' new ' , try the relatively recent social embarrassment of fake youth - all we oldies and fogies , in our 30s and 40s , who rather pathetically consider ourselves to be ' with it ' , because we have pages on Facebook , own iPods , and watch Skins The culture of fake youth sprang to mind when Children 's Commissioner Albert Aynsley - Green condemned the use of ' Mosquitoes ' ( the dispersal machines used by shops that emit a piercing noise that only under-25s can hear ) .
Aynsley - Green said they ' demonised ' young people , ' creating a dangerous and widening divide between the young and old ' .
I beg to differ ; if anything , there does n't seem to be enough of a ' young - old ' divide these days .
We could probably do with a Mosquito - like machine to disperse the fake youths as we flail around outside our age bracket like sightless movie zombies .
Indeed , far from being the worst generation ever , it seems to me that today 's young have been remarkably patient about sharing ' being young ' with the old .
It may not be the young who have changed for the worse so much as the not - so - young ; the fake youth generation who ca n't and wo n't let go and are probably so far beyond help now that we actually consider ourselves to be better at being young than genuine yoof , with their unfortunate complexions and happy - slapping shenanigans .
Indeed , while not to diminish genuine suffering around the country , it probably would n't hurt to ask a few pertinent questions .
Are the new yobs really so much worse these days ?
Or are their worst excesses simply publicised and criticised to an unprecedented degree ?
As for those of us stuck in fake youth , we may kid ourselves we are young , but we betray ourselves simply by the way we perceive and judge the ' louts ' leaning against the bus shelter .
We demand the Rooney rellies , Coleen Coleen McLoughlin , the future Mrs Wayne , is said to be banning the extended , ' fun - loving ' Rooney clan from this summer 's nuptials .
This would be a PR travesty .
Coleen 's 21st birthday party endeared her to the nation and not just because of those little buns with her face on .
With the cavorting , occasionally stumbling , guests , one girl flashing a breast at the tabloids , you could almost smell the Pernod , taste the lovebites , feel the grim determination to complete the macarena .
But there was also a feeling of honesty and sweetness .
As in : finally , a ' proper do ' , rather than just another stuffy , showbiz pose - a - thon .
Coleen must amend that guest list at once .
Quite apart from anything else , everyone knows that ' embarrassing rellies ' are as much a wedding staple as a tiered cake .
They came , they saw , they did some plumbing .
And how we 'll miss them The number of Polish people coming into the country is fewer than the number leaving for the first time .
It appears that many of them had the plan all along to make money , then go back to Poland and build their real lives .
Now , weary of the UK 's high cost of living , food and lack of career opportunity , they 're downing tools and returning home in droves .
Well , good luck to them .
After visiting Krakow , I have long had a soft spot for the Poles .
So I am pleased to see them giving immigration a certain diva - like panache .
They were happy to come over here for a look - see , picking up those menial jobs few Brits seem to want to do .
Now they 're just as happy to go home
and I hope they are taking with them the only downside to the Polish invasion - the frighteningly good - looking girls .
A minor point , you may feel , but it 's unnerving when you just pop into the chemist for your vitamins and find yourself served by the Polish Rachel Weisz .
Overall though , is n't this great - a kind of flexi approach to immigration ?
And perhaps a long overdue wake - up call .
The most depressing phrase in the English language has to be ' bloody immigrants ' - the whole thing a reflection of that dreary , surly attitude infecting the country that somehow as a nation we 're threatened or diminished by new arrivals .
Phooey .
The fact of being an immigrant alone does not make you interesting , but their influx down the years must be a large factor in Britain remaining interesting .
Now Polish immigrants are making it clear that for them the British chapter is over .
They are ' going home ' , but on their own terms .
It will be interesting to see whether the big immigration issue of the future will be not how to keep them out , but how to make them stay ."
2008-03-01,"Prince Harry touched down on British soil today after his emergency withdrawal from Afghanistan .
The prince , 23 , who spent 10 weeks secretly working in Afghanistan as a soldier , arrived at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire on an RAF Tristar troop transporter plane .
Prince Charles and Prince William were waiting for Harry , third in line to the throne , as he arrived on a troop transport plane at an airforce base in Oxfordshire , southern England .
The Prince of Wales spoke of his "" great relief "" at his son 's return and said he felt "" enormously proud "" at what Harry has done , but expressed frustration at his enforced withdrawal .
"" I feel particular frustration on his behalf that he was removed unexpectedly early because , apart from anything else , he had been looking forward to coming back with the rest of his regiment , "" he said .
He added : "" We owe an enormous amount to those families of servicemen who endure so much and support their loved ones with such understanding .
It makes a huge difference .
Harry was withdrawn from his deployment after a self - imposed media blackout preventing details of his deployment to Helmand Province from being reported broke down following news stories on foreign websites .
The prince has spoken of his desire to be an ordinary soldier and sees the military as his long - term career .
In a 2006 interview , he said he would not have gone through the rigours of officer training at Sandhurst military academy only to "" sit on my arse back home while my boys are out fighting for their country "" .
Although Harry 's deployment ended prematurely , it will nonetheless help his army career because he has seen active service and due to the assessment of commander , Brigadier Andrew Mackey , that the prince acquitted himself with distinction in Afghanistan .
Charles Heyman , author of guidebooks to the British military , agreed .
"" It will set him apart from the people who have n't been on active service .
That 's the most important thing for a soldier . ""
The prince 's deployment had gone undisclosed under an agreement between the Ministry of Defence and major news organisations , designed to protect Harry and his fellow soldiers .
An Australian women 's magazine reported on Harry 's deployment last month , but that report received little attention .
It was only when the news was posted on the Drudge Report website on Thursday that the dam burst .
The Ministry of Defence said last night that worldwide media coverage of Harry 's posting could have risked his and his colleagues ' safety had the prince been allowed to stay in Afghanistan .
It said Harry had been due to return "" in a matter of weeks "" before the news broke .
Media outlets were granted a series of interviews and allowed to take photos and video images of the prince , all to be distributed on a pool basis and used on his return .
That material was released after the story leaked out .
Society of Editors director , Bob Satchwell , who helped broker the media deal , said the arrangement should not be looked at as precedent - setting . ""
But on the other hand , you should never say never , "" he said .
"" It worked for a significant time , and it allowed Prince Harry to be deployed .
"" Harry 's work in Afghanistan 's volatile Helmand province involved calling in air strikes on Taliban positions , as well as foot patrols .
He spent part of his deployment at a base 500 yards from Taliban positions .
Conditions were primitive and dangerous , but Harry said the posting offered him a rare sort of freedom .
"" I think this is about as normal as I 'm ever going to get , "" Harry said while serving at a dusty outpost called Forward Operating Base Delhi .
"" It 's bizarre , "" he reflected .
"" I 'm out here now , have n't really had a shower for four days , have n't washed my clothes for a week and everything seems completely normal .
It 's nice just to be here with all the guys and just mucking in as one of the lads . ""
Harry joked in Afghanistan that he was a "" bullet magnet , "" a prized target for insurgents .
A plan to send him to Iraq last year was cancelled after British intelligence learned of threats by militants to kill him .
The head of the army , General Richard Dannatt , said at the time that intense media coverage of the planned deployment had made the situation worse .
The defence ministry said today that Harry 's elder brother , Prince William - second in line to the British throne - is also likely to serve overseas with the military , probably on board a Royal Navy battleship .
Officials said he could be deployed later this year on a tour to areas including the South Atlantic , the Persian Gulf , Pacific Ocean or the West Indies .
"" It 's our intention to give Prince William as full a taste of life in the Royal Navy as possible , "" a Navy spokesman said , on customary condition of anonymity in line with policy .
Many of the princes ' forebears have seen combat , most recently Prince Andrew , who flew Royal Navy helicopters during the 1982 Falklands War .
The princes ' grandfather , Prince Philip , served on Royal Navy battleships during World War II .
In those days , a combination of press deference , military censorship and slower - moving technology helped keep details of military operations under wraps .
Times have changed .
In the UK , both princes are stalked by the press and pictures of the pair are captured by paparazzi and beamed around the world .
Analysts say the combination of Harry 's celebrity status , an insatiable media and an age of instant communication makes it unlikely the prince - or anyone else with a similar profile - will serve on the front lines again .
"" We live in a crazed celebrity - reporting world , "" said Adam Holloway , a Conservative Party lawmaker who sits on the British parliament 's defence committee .
"" It 's pretty miraculous that he managed 10 weeks . """
2008-04-16,"For most men , a stag night on the Isle of Wight would mean a long car or train journey before sinking pints in a bar on the ferry .
But yesterday it emerged that Princes William and Harry travelled to their cousin 's pre - wedding celebrations on the island by RAF Chinook .
The £ 10 m helicopter was piloted by Prince William - currently on attachment to the RAF - who flew from RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire to Woolwich barracks in south London last Friday , where he picked up his brother .
The pair then continued to the Isle of Wight 's Bembridge airport , where they met Princess Anne 's son , Peter Phillips , who is getting married next month .
An RAF spokesman said the trip was a training exercise .
"" Having spent a week under instruction with a Chinook helicopter squadron , Prince William flew a legitimate training sortie which tested his new skills to the limit , "" he said .
The spokesman added that the prince 's instructor had said : "" Prince William showed natural piloting skills and an ability to pick things up quickly ...
he performed very well indeed . ""
Hours before the flight , the prince , 25 , received his RAF wings from his father , the Prince of Wales , at a ceremony at RAF Cranwell .
William and Harry are officers in the Household Cavalry Regiment , but William 's RAF attachment will be followed by another with the navy as a "" familiarisation "" process with all three services for his future role as the head of the armed forces ."
2008-04-29,"Prince William flew into Afghanistan to meet frontline troops , Clarence House confirmed tonight .
The Prince met service personnel at Kandahar airfield for three hours on Monday before returning to the UK .
The Prince of Wales and the Queen gave their consent to the trip , a Clarence House spokesman said .
The Clarence House spokesman described the trip as a "" success "" , saying that "" it had passed without a hitch "" .
Secrecy had surrounded Prince William 's visit , which was classified as confidential .
The whole trip took around 30 hours in total , the spokesman added .
William 's trip follows the deployment of his younger brother to southern Afghanistan .
Prince Harry recently returned from Helmand province after his presence there was leaked by the media .
He worked as a forward air controller , a post responsible for directing air support for ground troops ."
2008-04-30,"Prince William met frontline British troops in Afghanistan on Monday in a secret three - hour visit , Clarence House has confirmed .
The prince spent his time at Kandahar airfield in southern Afghanistan meeting members of the 3rd Battalion Parachute Regiment , known as 3 Para .
He had flown out in a C-17 Globemaster transport plane that left RAF Brize Norton , Oxfordshire , on Sunday and landed in Afghanistan the following day .
He piloted the plane for part of the journey .
After leaving Afghanistan the prince flew to Al Udeid airbase in Qatar .
The round trip lasted about 30 hours .
A Clarence House spokesman said last night that the trip had been kept confidential for security reasons and that Prince Charles and the Queen gave their consent . ""
The purpose of the trip was for the prince to familiarise himself with the operations of the RAF in theatre . ""
The spokesman said the trip was a "" success "" and "" passed without a hitch "" .
The Ministry of Defence said the trip would have enabled the prince to understand the use of air power and given him an opportunity to sample the "" RAF 's diverse range of the capabilities "" .
The MoD had to defend the prince this month when it emerged he and his brother , Prince Harry , had travelled to their cousin 's stag party in an RAF Chinook helicopter .
It was piloted by Prince William from RAF Cranwell , Lincolnshire , to Woolwich barracks in London where he picked up his brother .
The pair continued on to the Isle of Wight , where they disembarked and met Princess Anne 's son , Peter Phillips , who is getting married next month .
Ken Wharfe , a former royal protection officer , said William would have been in no real danger during his visit to the war zone , and the visit was a public relations exercise after the controversy over his helicopter flights .
"" There is an element of risk but there would be no way security officials would allow it to happen …
it would be pretty well sterile while he was there .
I 'm slightly sceptical about this .
I think the cynics amongst us will say it 's an attempt to cover up the Chinook jollies . ""
Last month , Prince William was presented with his pilot 's wings by Prince Charles at a graduation ceremony .
The prince , 25 , known in the RAF as Flying Officer Wales , is coming to the end of a four - month attachment with the air force that has taught him about the service 's ethos , traditions and military role as he prepares to eventually become the forces ' ceremonial commander in chief as king .
William is following in the footsteps of his father , who completed his flying training course in August 1971 and graduated that year as a flight lieutenant .
Next month , Prince William will undertake official engagements followed by some leave before a secondment to the Royal Navy at the beginning of June .
The prince 's visit to Afghanistan comes after his brother , Prince Harry , served in Helmand Province for 10 weeks , becoming the first member of the royal family to serve on the Afghan frontline .

2008-04-30,"Evening Standard royal correspondent Robert Jobson is joining the News of the World as royal editor after seven years at the Associated title .
Jobson , who broke the story about the engagement between the Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles in February 2005 , will take over the brief formerly held by Clive Goodman .
Goodman was sacked after he was convicted of illegally accessing mobile phone messages left by Prince William and Prince Harry for staff members of the royal household .
He later appealed against his sacking , but News International has not revealed the outcome of his appeal .
Goodman now works for the Daily Star Sunday .
Goodman was jailed in January 2007 , and the scandal led to the resignation of then News of the World editor Andy Coulson , who was replaced by Colin Myler .
Myler welcomed the appointment of Jobson , who will join the paper later this summer .
He said : "" I am absolutely delighted that Robert Jobson is joining the News of the World as royal editor .
He is a vastly experienced royal correspondent and author and will be an invaluable addition to our already experienced specialist team of journalists . ""
Doug Wills , the Evening Standard managing editor , said : "" Rob has had a terrific seven years bringing the Evening Standard a series of tremendous royal exclusives including the revelation that Charles and Camilla were to marry . ""
He got the date of the wedding absolutely right , leading to the Standard 's front page being shown on TV all over the world . ""
The Standard has set the royal agenda for the national media .
Rob now wants to join a Sunday paper and we wish him the best for the future . ""
The story about the royal engagement won Jobson the scoop of the year at the London Press Club Awards .

"" It has been a very long and hard season and as a lot of the players are foreign , they no doubt want to get home and see their families before getting back for pre - season training in preparation for the Premier League "" - Sandwell council leader Bill Thomas offers up a rather flimsy excuse for West Brom 's decision not to mix with the great unwashed by rejecting the chance to celebrate their Championship title win with an open - top bus ride .

2008-05-06,"In brilliant sunshine close to the river bank where a battle more than 300 years ago preceded three centuries of conflict in Ireland , the Irish premier , Bertie Ahern , yesterday carried out the final act of reconciliation between nationalism and unionism .
On his final day in office as taoiseach ( Irish prime minister )
Ahern joined the leader of the unionist tradition in Ireland , Ian Paisley , to open a new centre commemorating the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 when Prince William of Orange defeated the Catholic King James II .
Using two 17th - century swords , Ahern and Northern Ireland 's outgoing first minister cut the blue ribbon tied outside the door of Oldbridge House , the centre near the battle site which will house artefacts about the Protestant victory .
In his last major speech as taoiseach Ahern paid a generous tribute to Paisley for helping fulfil the Irish premier 's greatest achievement of his 11 years in office - peace and a stable political settlement in Northern Ireland .
After receiving a giftwrapped King James Bible from Paisley dated 77 years after the Battle of the Boyne , Ahern praised the former foe of previous Irish prime ministers from Seán Lemass to Albert Reynolds for agreeing to share power with republicans almost a year to the day .
It is still a U - turn that would have seemed unthinkable a few years ago : Paisley sitting down in government with former IRA leaders .
Ahern told Paisley : "" I would like to commend you for the leadership you showed in helping bring about the famous day in May last year when the democratic institutions were restored .
"" I would like to thank you for helping to lay the foundations for a peaceful and prosperous future in Northern Ireland ...
I 'd like to thank you for your courtesy to me and your friendship . ""
With the flags of Jacobite and Williamite regiments hanging limply above 17th - century cannons from the time of the battle , Paisley also heaped praise on Ahern for his role in helping restore powersharing in Northern Ireland .
The first minister said : "" To the bad old days there can be no turning back .
The killing times must end for ever and no tolerance must be given to those who advocate their return .
A strong dedication to peace and an intolerance of murder must drive us forward .
This must be the end of all atrocities and the building of the ways of peace . ""
Paisley had been asked what job Ahern should take up after he left office . ""
The Irish presidency , "" Paisley replied .
Yesterday , Ahern went to the current Irish president , Mary McAleese , and tendered his resignation .
The 1,500 assembled guests included members of the Protestant marching institutions , the Orange Order and Apprentice Boys , watched a mock firefight between lines of Williamite and Jacobite soldiers .
Musket shots punctured the still summer air in this picturesque corner of the Irish Republic , the silence of real guns north of the border a testament in part to Ahern 's premiership .
Among the rows of former political adversaries , unionist and republican , was Ahern 's successor , the Irish finance minister , Brian Cowen .
Later today , Cowen will be elected taoiseach in the Dáil ( Irish parliament ) and will focus on persuading the Irish electorate in a few weeks time to say yes to the Lisbon EU reform treaty ."
2008-05-31,"Prince William will begin a two - month tour of duty with the Royal Navy on Tuesday with HMS Iron Duke , a frigate on hurricane relief duty and counter - narcotics patrols .
But while senior officers claimed the 25-year - old prince would not receive special treatment , they admitted the placement was an abbreviated version of the normal two - year training most young officers received .
It was also the safest possible assignment they could offer William . '
It will be a real thrill and a privilege , and not a pain , for the ship 's company to have the opportunity of showing our future king what we do , ' said Rear Admiral Robert Cooling , assistant chief of naval staff ."
2008-06-03,"The drinks were on Prince William last night after he fluffed an attempt to drop anchor as he began a two - month attachment with the Royal Navy .
The prince , right , promised his new colleagues a crate of beer to make up for his error .
Despite the error , Commander Paul Halton , director of training at Britannia Royal Naval College , Dartmouth , said Sub - Lieutenant Wales , to give him his proper title , had so far been "" pretty good "" .
He will spend the next three weeks on basic naval training before joining the frigate HMS Iron Duke on patrols searching for drug runners in Caribbean waters .

2008-06-29,"It must count as one of the most expensive stag - do taxis in history .
Prince William 's Chinook flight to attend his cousin 's pre - wedding celebrations on the Isle of Wight cost the taxpayer £ 8,716 , the Ministry of Defence has disclosed .
The prince 's use of the twin - rotored helicopter became the focus of RAF ire after it emerged that he had dropped in at a wedding in Hexham , flown over his relatives ' homes and landed in his girlfriend 's parents ' garden .
Now the MoD has disclosed that five flights which have been the focus of the criticism cost the taxpayer more than £ 50,000 .
The ministry has revealed the price of each flight after a freedom of information request from the Guardian .
The RAF and royal aides initially sought to justify them as legitimate training flights , but later admitted that they were a "" naive "" public relations disaster and a "" collective error of judgment "" .
The first sortie took place on April 2 when Prince William flew the helicopter over his father 's country home in Highgrove , Gloucestershire .
The flight , which lasted nearly three hours , cost the taxpayer £ 11,985 , according to the MoD.
The following day , the prince once again got behind the controls of the helicopter and this time headed off to Bucklebury , Reading .
The MoD says he landed the helicopter on "" private land "" during what it described as a "" general handling "" training flight .
That private land belonged to the parents of his girlfriend , Kate Middleton .
The second in line to the throne is understood to have circled around the house at 300 ft before touching down next to the house while Middleton and her parents watched .
At the time , the MOD defended the decision to land in the Middletons ' field , saying : "" Battlefield helicopter crews routinely practise landing in fields and confined spaces away from their airfields as a vital part of their training for operations .
These highly - honed skills are used daily in conflict zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan "" .
But others criticised it as a frivolous waste of money at a time when the armed forces ' budget is stretched and questioned why a relative novice was allowed to fly a Chinook .
The MoD calculated the cost of the flight to be £ 8,716 .
The next controversial flight took place a day later when he flew to Hexham in Northumberland .
Conveniently , this was where he was a guest at a wedding .
The four - hour flight - described by the MoD as "" general handling and low level "" training - cost £ 18,522 .
His flight over the Queen 's Sandringham home on April 9 cost £ 4,358 .
His trip to the Isle of Wight on April 11 to attend the pre - wedding celebrations of his cousin , Peter Phillips , after stopping off in London to collect Prince Harry also cost £ 8,716 , for the two hours he was on board the Chinook .
Prince William , an officer in the Household Cavalry Regiment , was on a four - month attachment with the RAF as part of a "" familiarisation "" exercise to understand all the military services as he will head the armed forces on becoming king .
He spent 10 days learning how to fly a Chinook and was awarded his wings by his father in a ceremony at RAF Cranwell , Lincolnshire ."
2008-07-02,"Prince William was involved in a drug raid yesterday when his ship , the Iron Duke , seized a large amount of cocaine in the Atlantic , north - east of Barbados .
He was flying in the frigate 's Lynx helicopter , which was alerted by intelligence to look out for an ocean - going speedboat suspected of smuggling drugs to west Africa or Europe .
US coastguard officers on board the British frigate boarded the speedboat and seized 900 kg ( about 2,000 lb ) of cocaine with a minimum street value of £ 40 m , according to the Ministry of Defence .
The boat , believed to have begun its voyage in the Caribbean , stopped when ordered to do so and its crew was detained by the coastguards .
The prince was one of six navy personnel on the Lynx when the boat was spotted , the MoD said .
Other crew included a sniper and a pilot .
William , a future head of the armed forces , joined the Iron Duke on June 24 as part of a secondment to the navy .
Though he joined the Household Cavalry , like Prince Harry , it was considered too great a risk to the heir to the throne - and fellow soldiers - to send him to Afghanistan .
William was also awarded his "" wings "" after a four - month spell in the RAF .
The Iron Duke 's mission includes intercepting drug smugglers and assisting with disaster relief in the event of a hurricane striking the Caribbean region .
The ship 's commander , Mark Newland , said : "" This is a fantastic start to HMS Iron Duke 's north Atlantic deployment .
To have had a direct impact on the flow of cocaine into Europe just four days after we arrived in theatre shows the benefit the Royal Navy can have in the area of maritime security and counter - drug operations . """

2008-07-11,"To the sound of shrieking seagulls and popping champagne corks , a new fixture in the summer social calendar cantered over the horizon yesterday with the inaugural British Beach Polo Championships .
The rapidly - swelling polo - loving classes descended on Sandbanks , the enclave of millionaires ' mansions near Poole , Dorset , to watch the first chukka to be played on British sand , joining Miami and Dubai as the only places to have hosted one of the world 's most hedonistic sporting events .
The beach version of Prince William and Prince Harry 's favourite pastime looks and sounds a lot like the sport that is played by jet - setting aristocrats .
Thoroughbred horses thundered across a specially - prepared arena , ridden by chiselled - jawed and pink - shirted players from Canada , Argentina and England .
You could have been watching in the polo havens of Barbados and Argentina .
The spell was only broken by the chilly wind whipping off the Channel and the white - haired old ladies with their anoraks buttoned up , peering suspiciously through sunglasses from their beach huts .
In front of them , Team Audi took on Team Robert Walters in four six - and - a - half minute chukkas . ""
Hired assassins , "" as the professionals are known , saddled up alongside the "" patrons , "" often slightly portly middle - aged men who pay as much as £ 500,000 a year to keep a team going .
With names like Nico , Gonzalo and Jorge , the pros have more than a whiff about them of a Jilly Cooper novel .
The matches are fast and furious , and the extra - large orange ball , designed not to get lost in the sand , flies around at speeds of up to 100 mph .
"" It 's like rugby on horseback , "" said Sophie Heaton - Ellis , 28 , a professional player from Oxford .
"" These chukkas are full blast , with lots of contact , "" said Johnny Lynn , 36 , the Canadian umpire .
The game on sand is a condensed version of standard polo .
The beach rink is 100 metres long compared to 300 metres on conventional lawns and as a result , the game is a lot tighter and the horses hardly ever reach their top speeds of up to 40 mph .
The matches are shorter , to account for the extra effort the animals have to put in on the soft ground .
That is not to say the polo was not serious .
Half a dozen of the players in the six teams were full internationals .
But the polo was a sideshow to the social whirl around it .
A luxury yacht bobbed in the bay , with guests on board sipping champagne .
Inside a £ 250-a - ticket marquee , bankers from Merrill Lynch and Barclays mingled with salesmen from the Sunseeker Yacht company .
Together they dined on cod and summer pudding , accompanied by bottles of Chablis and Bollinger . ""
No one knows what 's going on with the polo , "" said one guest , propping up the bar with a glass of white .
"" It 's a bit like the cricket
— you come for the chat , and only a handful of the people here are true aficionados .
"" The organisers are ambitious .
An estimated 1,500 people watched yesterday , and the same number is expected today .
It is the beginning of a plan to turn Poole into an international beach polo destination , and the organiser , Johnny Wheeler , is keen to keep coming back for the next 10 years .
"" It is the most amazing spectator sport , and for too long people have felt it is an exclusive activity which only the rich and famous can be involved in , "" he said .
As the afternoon wore on and preparations began for the apres - polo party , the atmosphere on the beach became heady .
"" Poole is really the Miami of Britain , "" said Peter Adams , a local councillor , without a trace of irony .
"" We are trying to develop Poole as an international venue .
Bournemouth has its Harry Ramsden 's and a pier , and we are not trying to compete with that .
Poole is about something different . ""
Different , but certainly not elite , as almost everyone was keen to stress , despite a clear them - and - us dynamic .
Members of the public who did n't want to part with £ 35 for a seat in the stands had to perch on a sandbank and peer through a metal fence for a view .
"" Polo is one of the biggest - growing sports in the country at the moment , and it is not as elitist as people seem to think , "" said Heaton - Ellis .
"" It is far from the most expensive equestrian sport , and you can have a lesson for £ 60 .
Part of the sport has echoes of the Jilly Cooper lifestyle , with the champagne and fancy dresses , but it does n't have to be like that . ""
But for others , it is that elite scene that attracts them to the sport .
"" Everyone has a certain status in polo , and you know you are going to bump into people like company directors and hedge fund bosses , and that makes it great for networking , "" said recruitment company director and polo player Chris Cook , 33 .
"" One of my friends in polo is the captain of Chile , and his sponsor is Del Monte , and when he comes to Europe he has the use of their helicopter .
It 's that kind of world . ""
His wife , Julie , her Hunter wellington boots peeping out beneath a vibrant summer dress , summed up the appeal : "" It is the most amazing sport in the world — full of adrenaline , team spirit , horse power and man power . """

2008-08-13,"Once again , plaintiffs who have been waiting for a payout in the Exxon Valdez lawsuit will have to continue their wait .
The US supreme court yesterday declined to decide whether Exxon Mobil Corp should pay interest on punitive damages , which would nearly double the $ 507 m award punishing the company for its role in an oil spill that leaked 11 m gallons of crude oil into the fishing waters of Prince William Sound .
The lawsuit , which was filed within days of the 1989 oil spill , has been slowly making its way through the country 's appellate courts , winding up in front of the supreme court in late February .
The high court in June cut the punitive award from $ 2.5bn to $ 507 m and set a 1-to-1 ratio for punitive damages in maritime cases , based on the amount of compensatory damages awarded .
Exxon has balked at paying interest , which lawyers for the fishermen and other plaintiffs in the case estimate would bring the company 's total payout to $ 1bn .
yesterday , the supreme court officially sent the case back to the 9th US circuit court of appeals in San Francisco to determine the interest payments and the total punitive damages .
"" We can look at a few more years , huh ? "" said Andrew Wills , a former herring fisherman who now runs an inn and bookshop in Homer .
"" It would have been really simple for them to just say ' pay the interest ' .
I 've given up the supreme court . ""
But lawyers for the plaintiffs say it 's not unusual for the supreme court to shift such a decision back to the 9th circuit .
They do n't see yesterday 's move as a setback , said Stanford Law School professor Jeffrey Fisher , who argued the case for the plaintiffs in front of the supreme court .
"" It is typical procedure for the supreme court to decide to decide the big legal questions and to leave it to the lower courts to do the housekeeping , "" Fisher said .
"" Having said that , we 're going to do everything we can to bring this to a quick and expeditious close . ""
Lawyers for the fishermen and other plaintiffs in the case have calculated that interest will add up to about $ 488 m , bringing the total amount that Exxon owes from the 1989 oil spill to nearly $ 1bn .
Minus attorney 's fees
, they had estimated that $ 628 m would be divided among the more than 32,000 plaintiffs in the case .
Their calculations are based on interest accruing since 1994 , when an Anchorage , Alaska , jury originally awarded $ 5bn in punitive damages , an amount that was cut to $ 2.5bn by an appeals court and then to $ 507 m by the supreme court .
Lawyers for the plaintiffs calculated the interest on the $ 507 m , however , not on the original $ 5bn award .
It would be unprecedented for the plaintiffs not to receive interest , Fisher said .
They 've researched similar cases in front of the 9th circuit , and they 've failed to find one where interest was n't paid out - even when punitive damages are reduced .
In the cases they researched , interest was paid on the reduced amount , but going back to the original date of the judgment , Fisher said .
Lawyers for the plaintiffs filed their motion asking the court to address the question of interest as a precautionary move , based on their reading of an obscure supreme court rule in other , similar cases .
While it was an abundance of caution on their part , Fisher said , Exxon used it as an opening to file an aggressive motion seeking to avoid an interest payout .
Exxon argued in its brief submitted to the supreme court that the amount the court decided on was "" the legally correct amount necessary to deter Exxon and others from future oil spills , "" and that there was no intent to allow millions more in interest to accrue .
The company continues to maintain that if interest is payable , it should be from the date the supreme court determined the damages - June 25 . ""
Like everybody involved , we 're anxious to have it resolved , "" said company spokesman Alan Jeffers .
"" But the reality is , the supreme court has declined to rule on this motion by the plaintiffs .
So we will participate in that process in a timetable mandated by the court .
It 's really in the ninth circuit 's hands . ""
Exxon , which posted record profits of $ 11.68bn last quarter , has already accounted for a potential settlement of up to $ 507 m on its books .
The company , considered the most profitable publicly traded US corporation , subtracted $ 290 m from its second - quarter profits when they announced them at the end of July .
The settlement will be tax deductible , so the company 's accountants have estimated that it will have a $ 290 m potential impact on the company 's earnings .
That number could go up if Exxon has to pay interest on the damages ."
2008-08-17,"It 's five years since Vanity Fair 's special anniversary edition went on sale . ""
Young and Royal "" , it said on the cover , "" Europe 's thoroughly modern monarchies "" .
And there , peering from the news stand in white tie and tails , was young Prince William .
This was a "" Special Collector 's Edition "" apparently ; so I collected it .
Now - every collector 's privilege - let 's see what change half a decade has brought .
In one sense , leafing through quotes from "" palace insiders "" and "" veteran royal watchers "" , everything has changed .
Butler Burrell was still a beloved , trusted "" rock "" , not a turd left on the beach of history .
Diana 's memory was still cherished .
Camilla was still the lady in waiting to we d .
Kate Middleton has a student walk - on part ( in black bra and panties ) but "" friends insist "" there is no romance brewing .
But it 's the other sense that is more depressing : the sense that nothing has changed .
An art history degree has come and gone .
A gap year has turned to a lightweight tour of duty - flying choppers to stag nights , chasing boats in the Caribbean and giving the berserk recruiting impression that thoroughly modern officers are more at home in Boujis than Baghdad .
Oh , and Ms Middleton , on again , off again , is back on - and doing notably little except pose for pictures on her own terms . ""
Do you honestly think people would care half as much about William if he was the image of his father instead of his mother ? ""
one "" leading Conservative "" asked .
A Daily Mail guru says "" the princes are all that matter "" .
Young girls in their thousands are reported to worship Prince William and lust for his every glance .
He is handsome , tall and the future .
But today , in a curious way , all that is long past .
The truth is that "" papa "" is still waiting in line while William 's hair grows a trifle thinner .
The truth is that dad has more speeches about Frankenstein foods to make in his earnest fashion , while William has no fund of experience or passion to draw on when he starts making speeches of his own .
The truth , in fact , is that William may not be very interesting to a public reared on constant amazements .
Even his marriage , when it comes , will be confirmation of something known for years , as the comfortable commoner - black bras long gone - settles down for heir - bearing duty .
Is it cruel to characterise the onset of boredom thus ?
Perhaps .
Apart from too much late - night booze , the prince has done nothing wrong , or offensive .
To the contrary , he 's been studiously serious , going on slightly boring .
The frenzies after Diana 's death were simply too manic to last .
Dull , in one way , was the necessary order of the day .
But there 's the difficulty - and the reason why this "" Collector 's Edition "" seems a whole era out of date .
What happened when this "" hypersensitive "" "" deep thinker "" had escaped from the wrenching grief of a mother 's death ?
Actually , not much .
And that is the exact reverse of previous predictions .
Five years ago , when polls urged the palace to "" skip a generation "" , we were offered King William as regal salvation .
Organic carrots and talking to flower beds were off the royal menu .
A public used to youth and glamour apparently wanted more .
But now the terms of the royal trade have switched .
It 's Heir One rather than Heir Two who keeps the soap opera going , while the 26-year - old who might one day be king moves from a gap half - decade into the interminable wait of a gap life .
Now it is Charles , with his old - Tory ideas and new causes who looks the more interesting bet .
What would a thoroughly modern young prince have done in such circumstances ?
He 'd have got a job , put his degree to good use and built a career - not settled for unveiling plaques and saluting parades .
He would have found that modernity and utility are a perfect fit .
Missing that chance is not his fault .
Those damned courtiers are ever with us .
But , as you look at the boy in white tie gazing out at a world he barely knows , there is a clear sense of loss .
Maybe Europe 's modern crowns can move on and fit in .
But William , it seems , may just not get a fair chance .

To wit : Kate already HAS a job .
Before we find out what is is , though , they are good enough to remind us why other employment possibilities were discounted .
She wanted to work in a gallery , but could n't , because of "" the galleries ' wide , plateglass windows "" .
She briefly worked in some capacity at Jigsaw 's HQ , but as her boss points out : "" she needed an element of flexibility to continue the relationship with an incredibly high - profile man and a life that she ca n't always anticipate . ""
And now ?
Well , these friends harrumph , Kate "" actually does have a ' proper job ' in an office …
She is busy nine - to - five , five days a week "" .
But where ?
Why , at her parents ' children 's party planning business , of course !
Kate "" is helping to put together the all - important catalogues for the mail order outfit "" .
Also : she 's on a charity committee organising a rollerdisco next month .
So there you have it .
And whilst it 's tempting to see Kate 's move into the notoriously competitive helping - your - parents - with - their - brochures field as indicative of a new career ambition so ball - breaking that it could derail her glacial progress toward the status of royal fiancee … really , nothing could be farther from the truth .
You ca n't fight nature , and no matter how many high - level sections of that 24-page catalogue she arduously approves , nor how many ice sculptures she orders for the rollerdisco , sooner or later her biological sloth is going to start ticking .
As Spinal Tap 's David St Hubbins once observed , if he were n't in a band , he 'd be "" a full - time dreamer ""
- so let 's accept that the ad - hoc - brochure - assistant game is going to lose one of brightest stars someday soon , and just pray the rollerdisco is n't a casualty too ."
2008-09-11,"Going to a fancy dress party as Osama bin Laden is not a sensible career move , as chief superintendent Colin Terry is finding out today , but dressing up often catches out prominent figures .
Prince Harry was forced to apologise in 2005 after he chose to dress up as a Nazi at a friend 's birthday .
Among the only people to defend Harry was Aaron Barschak , the self - styled comedy terrorist who caused a media storm when he gatecrashed Prince William 's 21st birthday dressed as Bin Laden .
In 2004 the army held an inquiry after one of its guardsmen was mistaken for a real suicide bomber when he staggered home from a party dressed as Osama .
You might have thought the fuss about such stunts would make public figures very careful about fancy dress .
But there must be something about the dressing - up box that tempts them into clunking errors .
How else can you explain the Tory councillor Brian Gordon 's decision to "" black up "" as Nelson Mandela at his own fancy dress party ?
And what were senior BBC journalists thinking when they dressed as singing and dancing sheiks and terrorists in a video to send off a colleague to al - Jazeera ?
The full horror of some fancy dress mistakes only becomes apparent in hindsight .
When Conrad Black went to Kensington Palace ball dressed as Cardinal Richelieu , alongside his wife , Barbara Amiel , as Marie Antoinette , few batted an eyelid .
It was only after Black 's fall from grace that it started to haunt the couple .
And even It 's a Royal Knockout might have seem liked a good for idea for raising money for charity at the time .
But the royal family has never recovered from the shame ."
2008-09-15,"Prince William is to undergo training with the RAF 's Search and Rescue Force , prior to an operational attachment of at least 30 months .
The move appears to scotch the plans of the Royal Household for him to undertake more official duties following a return to civilian life next year .
The deployment would see him piloting a Sea King helicopter as part of an RAF team seeking out accident victims on land as well as sea .
It would be the culmination of training across the three services - he is currently with the Royal Navy following a secondment learning to fly helicopters with the RAF earlier this year .
William said : "" I want to build on the experience and training I have received to serve operationally , especially because for good reasons I was not able to deploy to Afghanistan with the Household Cavalry . ""
The RAF 's website says the SARF units deal with more than 1,000 callouts a year , adding : "" Hours are long and conditions extreme . ""
Mark Austin , the television newsreader , has taken a pop at younger colleagues in this week 's Radio Times : "" There are a number of pretty young women and handsome young men without a solid journalistic background reading the news nowadays ...
naming no names but particularly on the 24-hour news channels ... you do n't need to have been to a war zone to read the news , but it does help . ""
Presumably , in dodging the brickbats of your senior colleagues while reading an Autocue .
Not as dangerous though as broadcasting astrology shows and soap operas on Saudi television .
Imam Sheikh Saleh al - Fozan says those broadcasting programmes containing indecency , vulgarity and sorcery should be executed .
As the channels are partly owned by the Saudi royal family , this may not happen .
Ann Widdecombe has just announced her intention of writing her autobiography when she retires to her cottage on Dartmoor after the next general election , but says she wo n't be putting the knife into former colleagues : ""
Oh no .
Nobody need fear my autobiography . ""

2008-09-24,"Downing Street has drawn up plans to end the 300-year - old exclusion of Catholics from the throne .
The requirement that the succession automatically pass to a male would also be reformed , making it possible for a first born daughter of Prince William to become his heir .
The proposals also include limiting the powers of the privy council , in particular its role as arbiter in disputes between Scotland or Wales and the UK government .
The plans were drafted by Chris Bryant , the MP who was charged by Gordon Brown with reviewing the constitution .
They are with the prime minister 's new adviser on the constitution , Wilf Stevenson .
Sources said No 10 would like the legislation to be passed quickly in a fourth term and Bryant briefed constitutional pressure groups on the plans at a private seminar in Manchester this week .
Ministers have long thought it anomalous that it is unlawful for a Catholic to be monarch but have not had the political will to risk reforming the law .
The 1688 Bill of Rights , the Act of Settlement in 1701 and Act of Union in 1707 - reinforced by the provisions of the Coronation Oath Act 1688 - effectively excluded Catholics or their spouses from the succession and provided for the Protestant succession .
Neither Catholics nor those who marry them nor those born to them out of wedlock may be in the line of succession .
The law also requires the monarch on accession to make before parliament a declaration rejecting Catholicism .
Though the Act of Settlement remains a cornerstone of the British constitution , critics have long argued about its relevance in the 21st century , saying it institutionalises religious discrimination and male primogeniture .
Eight years ago , the Guardian launched a campaign for a change in the law , supporting a legal challenge on the grounds that the Act of Settlement clashed with the Human Rights Act .
Geoffrey Robertson QC , the constitutional lawyer who has represented the paper in challenges to the constitutional restrictions , said last night : "" I welcome this as two small steps towards a more rational constitution . ""
The Act of Settlement determined that the crown shall descend only on Protestant heads and that anyone ' who holds communion with the church of Rome or marries a Papist ' - not to mention a Muslim , Hindu , Jew or Rastafarian - is excluded by force of law . ""
This arcane and archaic legislation enshrined religious intolerance in the bedrock of the British constitution .
In order to hold the office of head of state you must be white Anglo - German Protestant - a descendant of Princess Sophia of Hanover - down the male line on the feudal principle of primogeniture .
This is in blatant contravention of the Sex Discrimination Act and the Human Rights Act . ""
The next stage , he said , was for the government to challenge the notion of a head of state who achieved the position through inheritance .
Dozens of people have been barred from taking their place in the order of succession by the Act of Settlement .
In recent years the Earl of St Andrews and Prince Michael of Kent lost the right of succession through marriage to Catholics .
Any children of these marriages remain in the succession provided that they are in communion with the Church of England .
In 2008 it was announced that Peter Phillips - the son of the Queen 's daughter , Princess Anne - would marry his partner , Autumn Kelly .
It emerged that she had been baptised a Catholic .
She was quickly accepted into the Church of England before the marriage and Peter Phillips kept his place in the line of succession .
The Coronation Oath Act requires the monarch to "" maintaine the Laws of God the true profession of the Gospel and the Protestant reformed religion established by law [ ... ] and [ ... ] preserve unto the bishops and clergy of this realm and to the churches committed to their charge all such rights and privileges as by law do or shall appertain unto them or any of them "" .
Any change in legislation would , among other things , require the consent of member nations of the Commonwealth .
Constitutional experts have argued that reform of the Act of Settlement and its related statutes would set in train an inevitable momentum towards disestablishment , and disestablishing the Church of England would automatically remove the rationale for the religious provisions binding succession to the crown ."
2008-11-10,"In the Mail on Sunday 's story about Prince William using an RAF helicopter to attend a party was a fascinating detail .
It highlighted establishment nervousness about the influence exercised by the Daily Mail .
The MoS had obtained email records that showed that the prince had used a "" training flight "" to attend his cousin 's pre - wedding bash without the knowledge of senior officers .
An email , sent by a senior officer to the station commander at the prince 's base , Group Captain Andy Turner , to explain what had happened contained this gem of a sentence : "" The Stn Cdr ( station commander ) has spoken to all Fg Execs ( flying executives ) yesterday to ensure that his stn continues to take account of potential Daily Mail moments . ""
Potential Daily Mail moments !
It is confirmation that the Mail is the paper de nos jours .
It is the major irritant and can set the agenda .
It can break embarrassing stories and then galvanise public support .
I would guess that something similar would have been written about the Daily Mirror in the 1950s and 60s , and about The Sun throughout the 1980s into the 90s .
But the Mail arguably carries even more weight within the establishment and its institutions ( such as the military and the royal family ) than either the Mirror or the Sun did during their heydays because it 's a middle market paper articulating the concerns of Middle England .
The royal family were sorely tested by the Mirror under Hugh Cudlipp and the Sun under Kelvin MacKenzie .
But the Mail under Paul Dacre is an altogether more troubling matter .
They need the support of the Mail 's constituency if they are to survive in their palaces .
Note also that the MoS obtained its story courtesy of Republic , the pressure group that wants the democratic replacement of the monarchy by an elected head of state .
Republic ( Full disclosure : I am a member ) had used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain the emails .
The paper also liberally quoted criticisms by a Republic spokesman .
In so doing , the MoS was helping to legitimise the republican alternative among its 5.7 m readers .
The Daily Mail followed up today , underlining its hostility to the prince 's actions , by repeating its Sunday stablemate 's story .
The paper 's support for the Queen is not in question .
But the implication of its editorial line in recent years suggests that her heirs are not going to have an easy ride .
Watch out for more "" Daily Mail moments . """
2008-12-05,"Knowing how you adore a new , slightly recherche celebrity , it seems the right time to open your cage door and usher in Pippa Middleton .
Pippa is the younger sister of workshy arriviste and Prince William consort Kate Middleton , and though she has been photographed taking champagne at all manner of promotional parties , Lost in Showbiz had been holding off drawing your attention to her until her media coverage had reached critical mass .
That moment seems to have come .
Last month , Pippa was voted No 1 in Tatler 's list of the "" 200 coolest kids in town "" , which is a bit like heading Jade Goody 's list of the top 200 public intellectuals .

2008-12-22,"Lord Triesman , the Football Association chairman , is to invite David Beckham and Prince William to become the public faces of England 's 2018 World Cup bid when the body applies to host the competition in the new year .
The FA and bid chairman has confirmed he will offer the duo prominent roles in England 's attempt to convince FIFAifa that it has the infrastructure and finance to host its first World Cup since 1966 .
With the 2010 World Cup being held in South Africa and Brazil in 2014 , FIFAifa are expected to return to the northern hemisphere and possibly Europe for 2018 .
Spain and Russia are considering entering the race for 2018 and Lord Triesman believes the global appeal of Beckham , employed by the team behind London 's successful bid for the 2012 Olympics , will still carry resonance for an event to be staged in 10 years ' time .
Lord Triesman , in Japan for the Fifa Club World Cup and the executive committee meeting that announced it will decide on the venues for the 2018 and 2022 games in December 2010 .
, said : ' Beckham is capable of having an extraordinary impact . '
"" He 's very engaging .
That 's very significant .
When I first started to talk to people about all this , one of the things people said was ' Get two or three very famous footballers and send them around ' .
That 's okayOK but all these guys [ Fifa 's 24-man committee ] meet very famous footballers all the time .
It 's not a surprise to them .
Footballers have to bring something else as well .
David does .
Prince William , another person in that generation , does .
He is going to be involved as he can be .
He is in the military so there are limits
but I am going to have a very long discussion with him about it .
"" England will officially register their interest in staging the 2018 World Cup next year and Lord Triesman admitted it the FA faces serious competition inside Europe and beyond .
He added : "" Not everyone has declared their hand , "" he added .
"" Spain are a serious football country if they went for it .
I would like to think after several years in the southern hemisphere it would be in the north
but I have no doubt
Australia will make a really serious effort at this .
Maybe Russia but I find it very hard to read whether they could do it when you look at what is happening in its economy and some of its internal issues . """
2009-01-02,"Following the last really important royal news , that Prince William has grown a beard remarkably similar to those of his ancestors George V and , less happily , Tsar Nicholas II , the next absorbing topic is whether the 26-year - old will get married in 2009 .
Traditionally royals have done their duty by diverting the nation 's attention during drab periods with fortuitous outbreaks of matrimony .
Think of the Queen in 1947 or , though these are possibly not the most felicitous examples , Princess Anne in 1973 and Prince Charles in 1981 .
The Irish bookmaker Paddy Power certainly believes the time has come for the gesture and maybe its clients will too : odds are quoted at 5 - 4 on an engagement , though only 8 - 1 on marriage itself - pipped by 3 - 1 on cousin Zara Phillips marrying her rugby beau Mike Tindall .
More tastelessly , the firm is quoting 16/1 on Charles ascending the throne this year , even though his mother still looks in pretty fair fettle .
Next week William and brother Prince Harry are for the first time to become joint patrons of a charity .
The Henry Van Straubenzee Memorial Fund is named after a prep school friend who was killed in a car crash at 18 in 1992 shortly before he was due to work in a school in Uganda during his gap year .
The charity has been established by his family to raise money for the school .
Wales has clambered aboard the Obama bandwagon with the disclosure that one of the US president - elect 's schoolteachers was Welsh .

2009-01-22,"The local fish and chip shop might ride out the recession when the upmarket Fishworks restaurant chain did n't , it was suggested today as a Scottish chippie that includes Prince William and three Oscar - winning actors among previous customers was awarded its industry 's equivalent of the cinema gongs .
Total sales at the UK 's 9,500 chippies rose by 1 . 7 % according to the most recent figures to last November as more people visited the nation 's most traditional takeaways .
The number of customers has risen by twice that amount , after five years in which business was static .
Industry body Seafish predicted they would continue to profit from growing hard times as the Anstruther Fish Bar in Fife won the 2008 fish and chip shop of the year competition , beating off about 1,000 competitors .
The shop , run by Robert and Alison Smith and their three sons , recently won its fourth Scottish title and has served Robert De Niro , Robert Duvall and Tom Hanks as well as the prince when he was at St Andrews University .
Andy Gray , of Seafish , who was a judge , said : "" Fish and chip shops are well - placed to prosper in the current economic climate as they offer value for money and a quality product with a feel - good factor .
Despite the credit crunch , people still want to enjoy small luxuries .
Fish and chips are a national institution which have survived the test of time and will be around for many years to come . ""
Seafish says chippies have changed dramatically in the 21 years since Toff 's of Muswell Hill , north London , became the first national winners , offering different varieties of fish such as the once unfashionable pollack , coley and hake .
Modern frying ranges and other equipment also mean they can claim to be one of the healthier takeaways , with less salt , less fat and fewer calories , it argues .
Sales of £ 717 m between March and October 2008 were up from £ 705 m over the same period the previous year , while the 548 m visits in the eight months to November represented a 3 % rise .
Yesterday Fishworks , founded by Mitch Tonks and known as Britain 's poshest fish and chip chain , went into administration with only four of its 10 sites being sold on .
Alison Smith said : "" Claiming the national title has always been our ambition , it 's the ultimate goal in our industry .
The title is a great reward for our hard - working staff and a great way of reminding our customers and fans throughout the UK where to buy the best fish and chips . ""
Richard Ord , of Colman 's , South Shields , the runner - up ahead of Thornton Fisheries in Thornton - Cleveleys , Lancashire , said this week : "" The credit crunch is being kind to us .
Our customers can have confidence in fish and chips despite what is happening on the high street .
Our sales back up the national trend as more and more people look to rely on fish and chips as a pick - me - up these days . ""
Another finalist in this year 's competition , Mark Petrou , who owns shops in Ely and Chatteris , Cambridgeshire , said : "" While trade has definitely dropped off in the local pubs in the past year , demand at the fish and chip shops has been unbelievable with a marked increase in turn­over . ""
Judging included a customer vote , taste tests , two shop inspections and a presentation to industry experts .
Responsible food sourcing , customer service , food hygiene , staff training and community spirit were examined alongside the quality of the fish and chips .

2009-02-01,"The name Butcher is synonymous with infamy in Inverness .
Two hundred and sixty three years have passed since Prince William , Duke of Cumberland and younger son of George II and Queen Caroline , earned the nickname "" Butcher "" for his army 's treatment of captured Jacobite soldiers at the battle of nearby Culloden Moor in April 1746 , but there are still those who bristle with indignation at the very mention of the dastardly deed .
Not content with routing Charles Edward Stuart 's supporters and forcing the Young Pretender known as Bonnie Prince Charlie to take flight , "" Butcher Cumberland "" ordered the systematic slaughter of the wounded and dying in one of the bloodiest acts in the history of British warfare .
Today another Butcher , Terry , will attempt to rally his troops at Caledonian Stadium when the former England captain oversees his first match in charge of Inverness Caledonian Thistle as successor to Craig Brewster .
Charged with the onerous task of halting an eight - match losing run that has plunged Caley to the bottom of the Scottish Premier League , Butcher can expect a somewhat friendlier reception from the locals than the one afforded his namesake .
On the face of it , a match with the champions Celtic is hardly the ideal baptism for any manager taking over a club seemingly in freefall .
But Butcher has always relished a challenge and , given his lengthy association with Rangers , whom he captained with distinction during the Souness era , he very probably views a scrap with the "" enemy "" as the perfect start .
Gordon Strachan , his opposite number , may also have preferred Celtic to have visited another part of the country this afternoon , for while the Celtic manager stopped short of expressing fear that his team face being "" Butchered "" he nevertheless expects the opposition to be reinvigorated by the presence of their new leader .
"" Of course they will get a lift from having a new manager and that is what we will have to deal with , "" said Strachan .
"" Their players will be inspired now that they are away from the negative media coverage and the depression that hung over the club has cleared .
The Inverness players will feel that they have a point to prove although as footballers they should be proving that point every week .
But sometimes players get caught up in the negativity and they are maybe feeling more relaxed now that there is a new manager in place . ""
Strachan recalled encountering Butcher in opposition during his playing career and clearly had the greatest respect for the Scotland assistant manager when their paths first crossed nearly 28 years ago .
"" I played against him when Aberdeen faced Ipswich in the Uefa Cup many moons ago [ season 1981 - 82 ] , "" said Strachan .
"" Ipswich were the cup holders and after drawing 1 - 1 at Portman Road , we beat them , 3 - 1 at Pittodrie and knocked them out of the competition .
I also scored with a penalty in the second match , but Terry was a top player ; a colossus and he could pass the ball as well .
"" It remains to be seen whether Strachan will extend Marc Crosas ' run of starts to four matches out of five , but he hinted strongly that the 21-year - old midfielder from Barcelona will feature after describing the Spaniard 's performance in the midweek CIS Cup semi - final win over Dundee United as "" phenomenal "" .
Crosas perhaps has mixed feelings , however , given that he suffered a hamstring tear on his previous visit to Inverness last October when Celtic won 2 - 1 .
Crosas confessed to having experienced a degree of difficulty adapting to the more physical nature of the Scottish game , which , he claims , is also faster than what he was used to in La Liga .
But he added that he is enjoying himself all the same ."
2009-02-28,"In November 1688 , Prince William of Orange , of the Dutch Republic , landed in Devon with an invasion force of 500 ships and thousands of men and marched on London , whereupon King James II fled .
William and his wife Mary ( James 's daughter ) were offered the throne , and London remained under Dutch military occupation until 1690 .
How did this "" invasion "" come to be known as the "" Glorious Revolution "" , a peaceful restoration of order ?
Lisa Jardine , with skill , eloquence , and lots of illustrations , answers by uncovering a cultural cohesion between England and Holland that predated and underpinned their political union .
The detail of dynastic intermarriage is laid out so clearly that its significance is obvious .

The detail is fascinating , the historical significance broad - for Jardine shows how grand events may be shaped by hidden relationships long obscured ."
2009-03-13,"Prince William spoke of the emptiness he feels on Mother 's Day as he last night agreed today to become patron of a ­charity that Diana , Princess of Wales , his mother , helped launch .
In a short and unusually personal speech to children who have lost parents or siblings , William said he understood "" that losing a close family member is one of the hardest experiences that anyone can endure "" . ""
Never being able to say the word ' Mummy ' again in your life sounds like a small thing .
However for many , including me , it is now really just a word - hollow and evoking only memories . ""
The prince gave the speech at an art ­gallery in central London , where he agreed to become patron of the Child Bereavement Charity , which was founded 15 years ago to provide specialist support to families when a child dies or a child is bereaved .
The charity has launched a Remember on Mother 's Day campaign , after its work with bereaved families revealed how ­difficult many find the day .
The prince said he could "" wholeheartedly relate "" to its campaign .
"" I too have felt , and still feel , the emptiness on such a day as Mother 's Day . ""
Speaking with bereaved families at the event , William said he had tried to "" blank "" his mother 's death in 1997 , when he was 15 .
"" Everyone has their own way of dealing with it , "" he told one family .
Julia Samuel , one of the founders of the charity and a friend of Diana 's , said the prince 's support would help "" shine a light on these areas of family life which are almost unbearable to think about "" ."
2009-04-01,"The air in Berkeley Square smelled of sweet , expensive cigars .
Around the corner from the Rolls - Royce showroom , a well - heeled art gallery was full of well - heeled white people , flushed pink with the thrill of proximity to royalty .
Prince William was flushed too , in a way that recalled his mother , and his adam 's apple bobbed as one of Diana 's old friends , Julia Samuel , spoke of the Princess of Wales 's "" outrageous laugh "" .
Then , hovering at the bottom of the small gallery 's staircase , the 26-year - old prince marked his decision to become the patron of the Child Bereavement Charity , which his mother helped launch , with a short and unexpected speech .
For the first time , the heir to the throne talked publicly about his loss , and the "" emptiness "" he felt on Mother 's Day .
If his words sounded posh - "" Never being able to say the word ' Mummy ' again in your life sounds like a small thing .
However for many , including me , it 's now really just a word : hollow and evoking only memories "" - they were also moving and unusually personal .
This two - minute address to a room of barely 50 people , and only three journalists , may come to be seen as a defining moment in the adult life of Prince William .
In part it heralded the start of a new charm offensive , a flurry of visits that were the defensive prod of royal spin doctors against a documentary accusing William of being lazy compared with his father , Charles .
But William 's personal revelations also represented a direct engagement with the legacy of his mother : the first reluctant steps of a young prince who must be found a meaningful public role and hopes , perhaps , to base it on his mother 's charitable work .
The House of Windsor 's two greatest assets - William and his brother , Harry - stand at a peculiarly vulnerable point in their lives .
They are also in an historically unique position .
The old deference in British society is weakening as citizens demand value for money and transparency from politicians and monarchy alike ; never before has there been a Prince of Wales as old as Charles , the longest - serving heir ; and never before have two young princes had to accommodate such a rampantly pervasive mass media which they , more than any other young royals , have good cause to loathe .
So what role should the young princes take ?
Can they modernise the monarchy ?
And what is best for them personally , as young men ?
How they , and their staff , answer these questions will go a long way to determining the future of our royal family ...
As you turn into Cleveland Row in central London , the traffic melts away .
Across the road from Buckingham Palace , Clarence House and the adjoining St James 's Palace is the home and headquarters of the Prince of Wales , his second wife , Camilla , and his two sons .
Buckingham Palace and Clarence House have long had distinct staff and operations , but this year another mini - empire was created : William and Harry were given their own staff and offices in St James 's Palace .
Inside , all you can hear is the soft ticking of an antique clock .
The princes now have their own private secretary , a former SAS soldier called Jamie Lowther - Pinkerton , and their own youthful press officer , Miguel Head from the Ministry of Defence .
They are given diplomatic counsel by Sir David Manning , the former British ambassador in Washington and Tony Blair 's foreign policy adviser in the run up to the Iraq war .
The operation is all paid for by the man they call "" Pop "" , thanks to his income from the Duchy of Cornwall 's lands and organic jams ( £ 16.3 m in the last financial year ) .
Yet many of this year 's stories about the princes have been unwelcome : the video where Harry calls a fellow soldier "" our little Paki friend "" , his split from Chelsy Davey , even his wearing of pink nail - varnish after another night on the town .
And after last year 's disastrous jape flying a Chinook to his cousin 's stag do on the Isle of Wight , William has also seen more bad headlines , notably from a Dispatches documentary which compared his workload with Prince Charles 's .
It stated that , in 2007 , William undertook 14 royal engagements whereas his father , aged 26 , performed 84 , despite a full - time career in the navy - and Diana , at that age , fulfilled 200 official engagements .
And then there is all the speculation about how long William will keep Kate Middleton - dubbed "" waity Katey "" by tabloids - hanging on for an engagement and that most eagerly anticipated spectacle , a royal wedding .
Supported by their dad 's private ( and taxed ) income , the young princes do not actually cost British taxpayers much .
We pay for their security costs via the Home Office , but Clarence House stresses the level of security provided is a government decision .
William 's minders are discreet and far fewer in number than most celebrities employ , although his image minders are hard at work countering charges that William is workshy .
Staff say the official statistics do n't tell the full story , that William is tied up with his gruelling RAF helicopter training and that he "" goes privately to all sorts of places because he knows he 's going to be able to connect with people "" .
He makes private visits to Centrepoint and another of his mother 's favourite causes , the Royal Marsden Hospital , and is patron or president of 12 organisations .
Anyway , Clarence House argues , comparisons with Prince Charles at a similar age are not valid because Charles had been heir to the throne since he was three ; William does not yet have such a senior role .
His royal spin doctors still seem worried , though .
At one point during the period I spent following him , William was yanked out of a meeting and I was introduced to him - just after being told I must not ask him any questions .
We had a short conversation which , in the arcane , protocol - obsessed world of royal reporting , was deemed completely off the record .
If Clarence House hoped this would make me warm to William , they were right .
He was likeable and professional , betraying only a flicker of unease about meeting this random journalist .
While the Prince of Wales was samba dancing around South America last month , his elder son was undertaking a far more spartan set of engagements in London .
As commentators have cruelly noted , physically William suddenly looks much more like his father . ""
A bad heir day , "" was the Sun 's headline when William visited a passing - out parade for police officers in north London .
His thinning pate gave him the look of that other prince still in search of a meaningful role : his uncle , Prince Edward .
William 's clasped hands and slightly stooped earnestness are indeed reminiscent of his father .
His gaze , however , is his mother 's ; a winning blend of sincerity and flirtatious playfulness .
The similarities are all too evident for Julia Samuel of the Child Bereavement Charity , who was good friends with Diana and remembers William as a boy . ""
He has that magic ability to make people feel better about themselves , "" she says .
"" It 's impossible to say it without sounding trite , but I think he 's exceptional , I really do . ""
After his speech about Mother 's Day , William hosted a dinner in St James 's Palace 's state apartments for the 40th anniversary of Centrepoint , acknowledging the incongruity of holding a lavish "" celebration "" for a charity that helps the young and homeless .
The following day , he visited the decidedly unfashionable St Giles Trust , a charity working out of a scruffy terrace in south London that helps ex - offenders and the disadvantaged find housing and employment .
During the Centrepoint dinner and at the St Giles Trust , William spoke easily to dozens of young people who had nothing in common with him .
Their reaction was uniform : William , they kept saying , was so down to earth .
He may be a privileged young prince but William is recognisably modern .
During his Centrepoint dinner , he revealed he watched The Bill , listened to Radio 1 and knew his urban pop culture .
( "" He said I looked like an R&amp;B star , "" said one Centrepoint resident , Ramone Edwards , 20 , wearing two glitzy studs in his ear .
"" A soft - spoken Snoop Dogg . "" )
William sat on desks and joked about the absurdity of these meet - and - greet sessions .
On several occasions , he apologised for the presence of the press : "" Sorry about everyone in the way ; we 've brought them off the streets , "" he said of the small media presence during the St Giles visit .
One aide attributes William 's winning informality to the fact his ascension to the throne is still some way off . ""
He and Harry are very comfortable carrying on the Windsor traditions , but they also know how to be ' normal ' - no offence to the other members of the royal family - because they have been accorded this level of privacy and normality that has n't been open to their predecessors . ""
William spent almost half - an - hour in private talking to Junior Smart , 33 , a team leader at the St Giles Trust , who rebuilt his life after being jailed for serious drug offences . ""
He was open - minded and flung ideas back , "" Smart told me afterwards .
"" I 've been to meetings with politicians and they all ask me the same question - what do we need to do to turn these young people away from gangs and guns and knife crime ?
I say , come down to the grass - roots level and see that it 's not true , not everyone who comes out of prison is useless - but William 's the first one to have done it .
He was talking to my clients and he gave them a lot of time , and I 've got to give him respect for that . ""
Views of how close William and Harry are to their father differ .
Some point out that Charles 's workload meant he was an "" absent father "" during their youth - but most agree the three princes have a close bond these days .
"" There was that famous suggestion by Lord Spencer , to rounds of applause at their mother 's funeral , that Charles should not be the only mentor of the boys , "" recalls Robert Lacey , the royal historian .
"" But that has not proved the case .
The boys have stuck very closely to their father as mentor .
They are following the trail he blazed , without anybody quite realising it . ""
But do the princes have ideas of their own ?
Everyone agrees that Harry is "" not a thinker "" , although staff in his office claim he has a gift for getting straight to the point .
But what are William 's big ideas ?
His conversations at the St Giles Trust revealed some liberal thoughts : "" A lot of employers do n't understand the lessons ex - offenders have learned just from being in prison or at rock - bottom , "" he told one group of former prisoners . ""
But I think it shows remarkable strength of character [ for you ] to be here in St Giles .
That in itself is a quality that should be put forward to the employers . ""
William "" is a typical firstborn : he 's more cautious and dutiful "" , says Judy Wade , author of Diana :
The Intimate Portrait and a royal reporter for more than 30 years .
"" But they are determined to carry on Diana 's work . ""
William 's commitment to Centrepoint , which Diana helped put on the map , demonstrates that .
Privately , he has expressed concerns about the collapse in moral values and breakdown of the family .
So far , however , William has no specific plans to set up his own career - defining charity and , as he and his office emphasise , his helicopter training commitments currently impede his charitable work ( this year he began training to become a search - and - rescue pilot for the RAF , and is committed to this career path for at least five years ) .
When his military commitments finish , his new office will be ready with a full - time programme of official royal engagements .
According to one royal watcher , while Charles is known privately for his indecision , his sons are more decisive . ""
Stubborn "" is used on several occasions to describe William , and staff stress they have no say about when , or if , he will get engaged to Middleton - and nor , for that matter , when Harry will settle down .
"" They are young men in their 20s and I have absolutely no idea what is on their minds in terms of relationships and what happens in the future , "" says one senior royal source .
A well - connected French magazine recently reported the imminent announcement of William and Kate 's summer wedding , but palace officials stonily deny all such speculation , and commentators judge there is no space in the royal calendar for summer nuptials this year .
If William is considered to be buttoned - up and cautious , then Harry is more wayward .
"" There is quite a normal pattern of an heir and a spare , "" says Lacey , "" where one of them usually goes rather radically off the rails .
But while we try and play up that stereotype with Harry , on the whole both young men have been remarkably serious in their application to their duty .
"" Part of the perceived difference between the two may come about because William enjoys far greater protection from the media than Harry .
William 's misjudgments are more likely to be well managed than those involving his brother .
Nevertheless , royal aides noticeably brighten when they talk about Harry .
Staff say he has grown up since serving in Afghanistan , but that he is still known for his sense of humour . ""
Diana said , ' He 's definitely a Spencer , he 's a real joker . '
She loved filthy jokes , the filthier the better , "" says Wade .
"" The fact that Charles is a bit of a thinker may have made his life more difficult .
Harry is not a thinker
but he 's got such warmth and charisma , everyone likes him .
He 's got the Diana magic -
he 's one of us .
""
Harry , who is learning to fly helicopters with the Army Air Corps , possesses the kind of popular appeal that makes everyone want to have a pint with him .
And , it seems , he is happy to have a pint with them too : on a trip to Lesotho , he enjoyed several evening beers with the royal press pack .
( Royal reporters believe Harry will get back together with Chelsy .
Both princes met their girlfriends during their youth when they were protected from press exposure ; today it is even harder for them to conduct a romance , or trust those they meet not to sell their stories . )
While William wanted to be a police officer as a boy , Harry hoped to be a soldier .
The younger prince got his wish .
"" Harry is a natural soldier and he 's a really good communicator , "" says a senior royal aide , and former soldier .
The aide speaks of Harry having the ability to jump in with the right word and "" hit the nail on the head "" at meetings of the princes ' charities . ""
His brother is naturally juxtapositioned with that .
But both of them are gloriously relaxed in their own skin .
Both have got a great emphatic thing from Pa and from mother . ""
"" Harry clowns , "" says Harper Brown , country director of Sentebale , the charity Harry co - founded to help orphans in Lesotho .
"" He 'll pick up a kid and just clown around , and it is spontaneous , not a chore . ""
Like William 's charitable work , Harry 's apparent desire to help children with HIV / Aids is a clear engagement with the work of his mother .
He is "" completely besotted "" with Sentebale , says a senior royal aide .
Just before I spoke to Brown , he attended the charity 's board meeting with Harry .
It may not have been an easy discussion .
Sentebale was reported to have spent only £ 84,000 on local projects such as children 's homes in its first 18 months of operation , despite raising £ 1.15 m .
Over the same period , £ 472,000 went on staff salaries , setting up offices , a website and vehicles .
Last month , the Telegraph revealed Sentebale had run into financial difficulties and Lord Ashcroft had bailed it out with a large donation .
"" It was our own fault , "" Brown says of the negative coverage .
"" On the surface , it looked terrible . ""
He explains that the figures reflect an 18-month accounting period during which the charity was only operational in Lesotho for four months .
By September , he says Sentebale will have spent £ 711,000 looking after nearly 2,500 children .
"" They are using the fact that we 've got Harry as our patron against us , "" says Brown .
What did Harry think of the controversy ?
"" In the board meeting , he told us that one of his policemen had said he 'd read the story and believed it .
So Harry sat him down and said , ' This is the story . '
I did n't have to tell him .
He knew .
He knows what we 're doing . ""
Lesotho , says Brown , is genuinely "" in Harry 's heart "" , but he does not expect much hands - on support in the next five years : "" He 's stuck in the military system at the moment
but he 's made a promise to come out here when he can .
"" The princes ' virtual exile from charity work because of their armed forces commitments may prove a serious strategic error for the House of Windsor .
Despite the current run of good publicity for Charles , the royal family needs his sons while they are young and popular .
British people may have no great desire for a republic , but their monarch 's role as head of state in Commonwealth countries such as Australia - where Camilla , in particular , is widely unpopular - will be tenuous at best when the Queen 's reign comes to a close .
If the young princes are anything less than popular and respected , it will hasten the demise of the royal family 's reach around the world .
Some experienced observers believe the monarchy 's failure to capitalise on the young princes ' popularity is down to a fear of upsetting Charles .
"" We 're getting a repeat of the 1990s when Diana outshone Charles , "" says one .
"" Now his sons are outshining him .
"" It is more plausible , though , that the decision to semi - exile themselves with their helicoptering is the princes ' own : perhaps they are simply attracted to the armed forces for the relative privacy it bestows upon their working lives .
"" Whether consciously or not , I 'm sure there is an element of self - protection in their choice of career in the armed forces , "" says Lacey .
"" It does n't just keep them out of public scrutiny , it is an answer to public scrutiny .
"" Are they reluctant to work with a media they despise but on whom their family 's future depends ? ""
The bit of the media they have a problem with is summed up in one word - paparazzi , "" says one Clarence House aide .
"" They are relatively thick - skinned about the daily grind of royal correspondents and stories .
You 'd have to be , when you are born with it . ""
"" They 've always hated the media , just like Charles hates the media - with a few exceptions , "" says one royal reporter .
"" It 's the whole royal family , it 's the ethos .
When you live in that world , you love everybody in the armed forces - there are no pacifists in the royal family - and loathe the media .
You 're conditioned to it . ""
"" I have no doubt at all that they loathe the media from the bottom of their souls , "" Lacey confirms .
"" But they are remarkably good at hiding it , and that is an indication of their professionalism .
Whatever their feelings , it does n't stop them appearing in public and addressing difficult issues like William did with his mother . ""
Lacey believes it is a media conceit that the princes must get on well with the press , not a requirement of the job at all .
Leading politicians do n't exactly love the media , he points out .
Those who work with the young princes say they are uniquely close , and not just when they are photographed together bonding over £ 100 Treasure Chest cocktails at Mahiki .
Some , however , fear their relationship may come under strain .
Harry , predicts Wade , is likely to be gradually marginalised while William is groomed for power , with all the responsibility - and image protection - that brings .
When William was being taught to fly a kite on a Norfolk beach as a youngster , a royal police officer took pity on Harry and offered to build him a sandcastle .
"" It 's the only bleedin ' castle you 're ever likely to get , "" the officer apparently said .
"" William is nice but I ca n't help hearing him ask , ' Do I have to do it ? '
"" Wade says .
"" You 're a prisoner , not just of the palace but the Foreign Office - telling you where you can and ca n't go .
You walk round all day talking to awestruck people who ca n't string two sentences together .
It 's a terrible life .
That 's why William and Harry do n't want to do it .
They want to put it off for as long as possible . """
2009-04-14,"It 's a rare and special day when the Mill , flicking through the morning papers in order to provide you , our honest and faithful reader , with the very best transfer gossip and general football tittle - tattle , comes across a truly incredible front - page scoop , something which briefly makes our head spin with excitement and the realisation that , despite all sorts of rumours , journalism is not dead after all .
And today is one of those days .
While most papers lead with updates from the royal family ( in brief : Prince William explodes £ 2 m jet fighter 's engine by pressing wrong button ; Princess Eugenie downs ketchup - laced beer in Thai lesbian beach bar ) , the Daily Telegraph 's top line is altogether more arresting : "" Free bird care pack for every reader "" , blasts the headline .
Beneath , the exclusive story reads : "" See page 25 "" .
And if you turn to page 25 , you 'll find it 's true .
There 's a "" high - energy peanut pecker and suet feast "" , a 2 lb bag of "" top - quality bird seeds "" and a pair of binoculars , "" so you can watch all the fun unfold in your garden "" – and it 's all free !
Except for the £ 5.15 postage , obviously .
Also available , just as free and not even incurring a postage charge is Alan Curbishley , although Telegraph readers will be disappointed to find there 's only one of him and he 's set to be named Sunderland 's emergency new manager just as soon as he sorts out his long - running dispute with West Ham , which might even be this week .
In other news , Fulham are planning a double summer swoop on Spurs , with Tom Huddlestone and Gareth Bale on Roy Hodgson 's wish list .
Huddlestone yesterday admitted , encouragingly , that he might have to leave White Hart Lane to find first - team football –
"" I 'm not young any more , "" said the 22-year - old .
Hull want to sign their on - loan Manchester United striker Manucho , though they only want to pay £ 750,000 for him , and Barcelona want to snap up Manchester United target Franck Ribéry , who encouragingly has told his FC Bayern Munchen team - mate Mark Van Bommel "" he wants to play for Barcelona "" .
Celtic want West Brom 's Marek Cech , Colin Kazim - Richards has fallen out with Fenerbahce coach Luis Aragonés and would like anyone from England to get in touch , and Liverpool have been linked with Athletic Bilbao 's Javi Martínez .
Again .
David Beckham has been pictured wearing two sweaters at the same time .
Latest news from the expanding Rooney family , according to the Sun , is that if their child turns out to be male Wayne is planning to decorate his nursery "" with wallpaper printed with pictures of the Goodison Park stands , blue carpets and the Everton crest "" ( with his own allegiance to Everton now very much in doubt this is presumably because babies , like Everton fans , have a habit of crying when you leave ) .
If it 's a girl Coleen will just paint it pink .
And Mark Hughes says his Manchester City team are still "" two years away "" from winning their first trophy .
After all , it will take them that long to even qualify for the Johnstone 's Paint Trophy .
And Jermaine Pennant was dragged out of a party at a trendy London bar yesterday because his girlfriend was worried by the amount of female attention he was getting .
Apparently they were all interested in his high - energy pecker .
Telegraph reader , you see ."
2009-04-29,"Gosh , so Prince William is officially to open the revamped Whitechapel Art Gallery , traditional home of radical art politics , cooler - than - cool exhibitions and the wilder shores of the avant - garde .
What he will make of Isa Genzken 's writhing mannequins and associated paraphernalia , Heaven only knows .
All a bit different from granny 's Rembrandts and Van Dycks , that 's for sure .
On the other hand , I do n't know , maybe St Andrew 's art history degree course is all over contemporary art .
Well , it will all certainly make for a fascinating clash of cultures .
We look forward to seeing whether Iwona Blazwick , the Whitechapel director , will bob a curtsey in the direction of HRH on 11 May."
2009-07-21,"Billed as an exclusive , the story told how Prince Harry had received a joke phone message from Prince William pretending to be the younger man 's then girlfriend , Chelsy Davy , and berating him over his antics in a lap dancing club .
The page seven lead in the News of the World , published in April 2006 , became a talking point at today 's select committee hearings for two reasons .
Firstly , the story was bylined Clive Goodman – the royal editor later jailed for hacking into royal aides ' phones – and Neville Thurlbeck – the paper 's chief reporter .
Secondly , the story also relied on quotes it said were from a message left on Harry 's phone .
This raised a number of questions from MP Adam Price , who pointed out that it appeared to be a case of phone hacking .
He asked Andy Coulson , the editor at the time , if he remembered the story .
Coulson did not , adding that he did not micro - manage every story .
It was possible to work alongside someone and not know what they were up to . ""
The headline reads , Chelsy Tears a Strip off Harry , "" said Price .
"" It is based around a phone message left by Prince William imitating Chelsy on Prince Harry 's phone . ""
Either the story is untrue , or it is based on phone hacking of the prince 's phone .
Are you saying as editor , a page seven story about princes and about a message left on their phones , and you do n't remember ? ""
Coulson said : "" I do n't remember it . ""
Price responded : "" Is n't that astonishing ?
Here is a story based on a verbatim account of a message from one prince to another .
And you are telling me you do n't remember it . ""
Coulson replied : "" I can only tell you what I remember .
And I am afraid I simply do n't remember the story , so I can only conclude I played no part in it . ""
Leafing through the paper , he said there had been a lot on that week .
Earlier , News International 's lawyer Tom Crone said he also had no knowledge of the story : "" I do not remember page seven stories , ever . ""
He added that Goodman and the private detective Glenn Mulcaire had been charged with hacking into royal aides ' voicemails , not the princes ' ."
2009-09-23,"Prince William is to launch a charity with Prince Harry in a bid to be seen as more than just a royal "" ornament "" .
Inspired by the example of his grandmother , the prince says there is a "" time and place for being an ornament … or shaking hands and being at an engagement and showing support in that way , "" nonetheless more can be gained from "" actually doing stuff . ""
The 27-year - old prince is currently training to be an RAF search and rescue pilot but what do we really want from our royals : good works , or someone who shows up , shakes hands and cuts ribbons ?
And what can William do to change his public image ?"
2009-09-25,"It 's been a good week for monarchists compiling scrapbooks of the lives of the younger Royals : Prince William , in a rare TV interview , expressed his desire to be more than an "" ornament "" who shakes hands and opens buildings ; while Princess Eugenie , attended by paparazzi and expensive Scotland Yard bodyguards , matriculated at Newcastle University .
William 's desire to be more than a decorative presence in public life is impressive , but probably futile .
In palace - creeper cliche , the job of those closest to the throne is to produce an "" heir and a spare "" , but William endures the burden , until his father 's death or renunciation of the succession , of being a spare heir – a double redundancy that Charles , who became next - in - line at the age of four , has been spared .
If I could make one change to newspaper style books , it would be to outlaw the sentimental formula "" future king "" , as applied to Charles and William .
It is in the nature of their tragedy that they may or may not be , depending on numerous factors .
The life of a male royal below the throne consists of a bit of soldiering and then a lot of nothing ; and , at 27 , Charles and Diana 's elder son seems nervously to be contemplating the void ahead .
But the difficulty with his desire not to be an ornament is that , in a constitutional monarchy , his current role is no more than trimming .
Like his father , he resembles a commuter who has just heard an announcement that the train is unlikely to arrive for at least 20 years , although he should be relieved : on his dad 's platform , they were warning of delays of up to eight decades .
The other problem lies in the second - in - line 's touching desire to combine in his charitable activities the "" best bits "" of his mum and dad 's pro bono work .
But , if best is defined as most effective and heartfelt , then the campaigns of Charles and Diana that he is seeking to emulate were widely questioned as inappropriate for a royal : her targeting of land mines and his advocacy of alternative medicine and conservative architecture .
His mother only got away with her humanitarian assaults on the arms trade because divorce had placed her outside the royal family 's control .
And the crusades that have clearly given the greatest sense of purpose to the Prince of Wales – pro - homeopathy and anti - skyscraper – have resulted in public rebukes from members of the Royal Society and Royal Institute of British Architects .
Although the Charity Commission yesterday cleared Charles of placing undue influence on the public planning process , there remains a widespread belief , in architecture and politics , that his attempts to blue - pencil the British skyline are an abuse of his position .
In this context , it 's hard to see which causes William could choose that would be important enough to him but irrelevant enough to prevent kerfuffles from the government or the media .
And the royal train that may one day carry him away from all this still posts indefinite delays .
We are likely in the next 10 - 20 years to see the beginning of a new shape to royal life in Britain : with students camping out on hillsides to gain their badges from the Earl of Wessex Scheme , KCs arguing cases in the courts and Prince William of Wales negotiating with Waitrose over the stocking of biscuits from the Duchy of Cornwall range .
The rest of his time will be spent cutting ribbons and shaking hands .
He deserves sympathy because he did not ask to be born to these tasks , but however much he stamps his feet on the mantelpiece of establishment life , he is fundamentally an ornament .
Still , he 's in a better position than his cousins Beatrice and Eugenie , who get all the publicity and flak about expenditure of public money , but are constitutionally insignificant : no more than the wall against which ornaments lean ."
2009-10-26,"He 's braved Indonesia , Kosovo , Iraq and Afghanistan , and found time to teach both Prince William and Harry , but Rory Stewart 's next challenge is almost certain to be navigating the backbenches of the House of Commons .
On Sunday night , the former foreign office civil servant , writer , academic and tutor to royalty beat five other candidates to win selection to the safe Conservative seat of Penrith and the Border .
He is now standing to become the MP for the constituency currently represented by David Maclean , who is suffering from multiple sclerosis and who is standing down on health grounds .
Following the redrawing of boundaries the seat has a notional Tory majority of more than 10,000 .
Stewart has served in the British army and in the foreign service , where he worked in Indonesia and the Balkans .
He became the governor of a province of occupied Iraq during 2003 and 2004 , about which he wrote his book , The Prince of the Marshes .
Prior to that he wrote about walking across Afghanistan in the winter of 2001 to 2002 in the Places
In Between , which became a New York Times best seller .
The 36-year - old is a former Harvard professor and soldier , as well as being the executive chairman of the British charity , the Turquoise Mountain Foundation .
Stewart brings a knowledge of modern war zones to the ranks of new candidates which , according to analysis carried out by a communications consultancy , currently includes no new prospective MPs with military expertise .
However , the selection of such a high - profile candidate is not an unalloyed good for the Tory high command , with Stewart taking a different position on the war in Afghanistan .
He has written before that he feels Afghanistan is a misguided conflict and nation building an ill - fated project .
Speaking at the Penrith Auction Mart on Sunday night , Stewart said : "" Thank you for changing my life
…
I 'm unbelievably happy .
This has been a life - changing experience .
I will be straight on to the estate agent in the morning .
I 'm very much looking forward to living in the constituency and getting to know everybody .
"" Speaking at the selection , about what he regarded to be the problems for the constituency , he said : "" I believe in protecting agriculture , not because it 's all there is in the constituency .
Farmers have had a tough deal from Westminster .
Rural areas have been badly neglected and I want to work to make sure everything from post offices to bus stops are maintained in this constituency .
"" Born in Hong Kong , Stewart was raised in the Scottish Highlands town of Crieff , where he still lives .
In August 2008 , Studio Canal and Brad Pitt 's production company , Plan B , bought the rights to a biopic of his life , with the British actor Orlando Bloom already rumoured to be in line to play him .
He was educated at Eton , and Balliol College , Oxford , where he studied modern history and politics , philosophy and economics .
During this time he spent a summer holiday tutoring both William and Harry .
In July , Stewart asked an interviewer for the Financial Times whether she thought he should become an MP , and whether he should also aim to become prime minister ."
2009-12-13,"Buckingham Palace today rejected claims that Prince William was being installed as a "" shadow king "" ready to take on more of the Queen 's official duties .
A Treasury document obtained under the Freedom of Information Act spelled out that the 27-year - old prince was to start spending more time on official engagements .
The Mail on Sunday interpreted the document as evidence that William was being set up as a "" shadow king "" and claimed it would add to speculation that the Queen believed William â€ “ rather than his father , Prince Charles â€ “ represented the best bet for the royal family 's long - term future .
Republican campaigners claimed the document showed secret plans about the future of the monarchy were being hatched behind closed doors that ought to be aired in public .
The palace dismissed as "" completely untrue "" any suggestion that the documents showed William was being favoured over Charles or that the Queen was set to dramatically cut the number of engagements she took on .
A spokeswoman said other members of the royal family , including Charles , often represented the Queen because she could not get to all of the events to which she was invited .
She pointed out that it was already known that William is to travel to New Zealand and Australia to represent the Queen in January â€ “ his first trip in such a capacity .
The document in question was a Treasury paper concerning tax arrangements in relation to Prince Charles and the new office set up for William and Harry this year .
It includes the line : "" The princes [ William and Harry ] will increasingly incur expenditure when undertaking engagements on behalf of the Queen . ""
A copy of the document was obtained by the campaign group Republic .
Although it contained redacted sections , Republic said it had uncovered the text that had been blacked out by changing it to a different format .
A spokesman said the group believed the document showed planning was well under way for the Queen 's succession .
He criticised the redactions that would have made it harder to find out financial arrangements concerning the princes ' new office .
Hugo Vickers , the writer and broadcaster on royal matters , said he was not surprised that William was taking on more duties .
He said : "" It 's a great advantage for a man of his age having grandparents he can learn from .
He 's 27 now .
One feels a pretty grown - up person by that age and it seems the right time to be doing more .
I welcome this â€ “
he 's popular and it 's good to bring the next generation through . ""
The royal documentary maker Margaret Holder said she welcomed William playing a "" more supportive role "" . ""
[ The Queen ] and Prince Philip are in their 80s .
They will have been hoping for more help . ""
She said there were problems with Charles and Camilla representing the Queen because they were not as popular around the world as the young princes and , on a practical level , Camilla did not have the stamina for long trips to the tropics . ""
William is the answer to the Queen 's prayers
â€ “ handsome and young and popular around the world . """
2009-12-14,"Royal officials today insisted that Prince William 's first official overseas tour , to New Zealand next month , was not an attempt to head off growing republican feeling in the country .
The 27-year - old prince will open New Zealand 's supreme court building in Wellington on 18 January during a five - day trip which will also include an unofficial visit to Australia .
Royal officials denied suggestions over the weekend that the invitation meant the prince was supplanting his father in the line of succession .
A senior official said : "" It is inevitable as he gets older that the Queen will ask him to represent her .
Her Majesty sees it as an opportunity for her grandsons to learn the ropes .
"" The first half of the visit is at the invitation of New Zealand 's government , whose prime minister , John Key , has said he sees the country becoming a republic within a decade as inevitable .
The second half of the trip , to Sydney and Melbourne in Australia , is being made at the prince 's own request .
Whether he will meet the Australian prime minister , Kevin Rudd , is still being considered in Canberra .
Palace sources expect the prince 's first official visit to generate crowds .
Although he visited New Zealand during the British and Irish Lions ' rugby tour there in 2005 , he has not been to Australia since he accompanied his parents on their tour in 1983 .
Prince Charles himself last visited the region in 2005 .
Officials at Clarence House said the prince 's grandmother , who is also New Zealand 's head of state , passed on the invitation for an official visit . ""
The Queen of New Zealand graciously passed on the invitation to him .
I am not getting into the political why s and wherefores , "" an official said .
"" This is not about Prince William getting enmeshed in politics ; it is about him going to open the supreme court building .
"" We are planning for crowds , we would be stupid not to – there is going to be a lot of interest .
I do n't think it would be appropriate for us to comment on the actions or intentions of groups within the country . ""
The itinerary includes a trip across Auckland harbour in a yacht with the New Zealand crew preparing for the Americas Cup , a visit to a nature reserve to see a real kiwi – a bird not a person – and a tour of a children 's hospital .
Key is holding a barbecue in the prince 's honour .
In Australia , there will be visits to see the governor general and state governors in New South Wales and Victoria , a meeting with Australian troops and a visit to an oceanographic survey ship in Sydney harbour .
Clarence House staff said the prince would be taking a week of his annual RAF leave to undertake the visit , before starting the following week training as a helicopter search and rescue pilot .
The New Zealand government is paying for its part of the trip and the Queen is underwriting the cost of the second half .
A palace official said : "" Prince William is looking forward to this immensely .
He has been ticking off the days .
He has heard his brother going on about his gap year [ in Australia ] for six years and it will be a fantastic opportunity for him . """
2009-12-27,"The juxtaposition of scheduling looks accidental , but it is hard to imagine a more perfect three - day encapsulation of the choices facing Prince William , with increasing urgency , than his itinerary , between 17 January and 20 January , in the Antipodes .
That first day , he opens the new Supreme Court building in Wellington , New Zealand , as the Queen 's representative : it is another coming of age for him , being the first time he has represented the monarch in an official capacity .
Two days later he flies to Australia for a series of less formal engagements .
They include a visit to an inner - city community centre in a depressed part of Sydney , after undergoing a traditional Aboriginal welcome , and then a round of live - firing practice with 3rd Battalion , The Royal Australian Regiment .
Duty , charity and the forces .
The three will always play their parts in his life , as they do in the lives of all male royals : but it is going to be up to him to settle , very soon , the precise mix of the three which will , in so many ways , define him for the next few years , perhaps decades .
Even Charles , his father , a man oddly estranged from self - criticism despite all the introspection , is said to accept that his own vacillations during his twenties â€ “ was he to be a political royal , a playboy royal , an environmental royal or simply king - in - waiting ?
â€ “ prevented him from defining any fulfilling role for himself : some would say the damning vagueness of ill - definition still haunts him , almost 40 years on .
No one in "" the firm "" remotely wants the same ethereal miasma to smother William Arthur Philip Louis Mountbatten - Windsor , who could be facing a long , long wait himself before he becomes William V.
Despite the interminable speculative ramblings about the crown "" jumping "" a generation , the Queen ( through memories of the Edward fiasco ) loathes the idea of abdication , and the idea of Charles willingly passing up kingship is still as likely as Brown selflessly turning down Number 10 when Blair went .
So , at stake , this coming year , is the future happiness of a personable enough young man .
And quite possibly , the future happiness of the monarchy .
Why this year ?
Partly age , of course .
William will be 28 in June , only eight years short , incidentally , of the age his mother was when she died ; it 's getting late in the day to be making a career choice , even for a "" career "" which you could argue has to be thought about more than most .
He may , also , be getting married , which can tend to focus a chap 's thoughts about life .
Certainly , speculation over an imminent engagement is hardly new .
Few things age as fast as cultural references , and the fact that most of the last batch of stories about forthcoming nuptials to Kate Middleton included references to "" commemorative mugs and tea - towels from Woolworths "" says much .
But it looks , this year , with the couple back together and the earlier "" split "" now seen as half - hearted at best , almost done to confuse and exercise the hysterical , hated media ( yes , they all still hate us ) as if "" Waity Katey 's "" time might have come ; and , in fact , hosts of modern couples in their twenties now split and reform two , three times before marriage .
Even the more vicious bits of gutter - sniping about class and "" suitability "" â€ “ that woeful sneering about her mother 's being an air stewardess ( forgetting that her father was a pilot ) and the like â€ “ has , by and large , abated .
There is also timely relevance to the fact that this all - important visit takes place Down Under .
New Zealand is still toying , when it bothers to think about it , with republicanism , with votes for and against split almost 50 - 50 , but it 's not that hot an issue .
There 's more active campaigning in Australia , 10 years after the failed referendum on the issue , but even hardline anti - monarchists exude a sense of fatalistic resignation .
Speaking about what might happen on the Queen 's death , even the head of the Australian Republican Movement , retired major - general Mike Keating , said : "" Perversely , if Charles and Camilla take over , the old Aussie ethos will say : ' He 's in there now , and maybe he wo n't be such a big dolt now that he 's the monarch .
It 's only a fair thing to give the man a go . ' ""
And William 's visit wo n't hurt .
Charles and , in particular , Camilla , are still broadly unpopular â€ “ as they are in other overseas territories ; witness the recent lukewarm receptions in Canada â€ “ but William is still linked to Diana , who was wildly popular , even among confused republicans .
So he 's going to be doing his bit for the family , increasingly so .
The recent surprise announcement that he 's signed on for a further five years with the RAF means he ca n't throw himself into that kind of work fully , but the gates have now been opened ; we will be seeing more of William in public .
What kind of William will we be getting ?
In truth , they would seem not to have done too bad a job .
In a world of unparalleled media scrutiny â€ “ even the actual heir , Charles , still had it easier in his twenties â€ “ the decision to send him to St Andrews , and his decision to stick with the forces , have saved him from the madness of a goldfish - bowl life .
By all accounts he has emerged far more "" normal "" than may have been expected .
The success of the hands - off deal with the media for the university years â€ “ the only people to properly intrude were , of course , Ardent Productions , headed by his uncle , the shiftless Edward â€ “ meant he was allowed to have friends , get drunk , shop in supermarkets , meet a girl ( Kate ) , even live with her :
the trusted if insular Scottish town proved the perfect choice .
The forces , too , have allowed a certain equality with other ranks ; and , of course , fabulous privacy .
In recent years , as often happens in the twenties , both he and Harry have begun getting on splendidly with their father .
They email "" Pop "" constantly , and gleefully showered him and Camilla ( around the corner , away from the cameras ) with confetti at their Windsor wedding .
The brothers , who share a rented flat when on service near RAF Shawbury , have also grown up emotionally in increasing spurts over the last four years , and recently jointly opened their own charitable foundation ( perhaps aiming to emulate , but jointly , the unarguable success of the Prince 's Trust ) , and have their own dedicated joint private secretary , and their own press officer .
William spent a night in sub - zero temperatures on the streets of London to raise awareness , rather successfully , for Centrepoint , the homeless charity and one of his mother 's favourites .
Insiders there say that , apart from being the first royal to go this far , his visits to Centrepoint are genuinely welcome , his conversations with the disenfranchised and dispirited lengthy , and honestly curious .
As with the looks â€ “ his mother 's big eyes and girly cheeks , his father 's thinning pate
â€
“
he 's taken a good whiff of both gene sets ; along with the sense of duty , which he can hardly avoid , there 's a warmer , more tactile nature , which , if we 're going to be stuck with a monarchy , surely bodes better than it might have .
He has also , over the last three years or so , appeared to have lost a certain gaucheness , surely part of the RAF life ; there are precious few accounts of late of the blushing and mild stooping .
Not a badly rounded young man , then ; and when he decides , soon , whether the main ingredient in his life will be the duty â€ “ with all the travel and sights ( and boredom , and fawning , and press )
â€ “ or the security of the forces , or the ability to make quantifiable visible differences to poor people 's lives , he will have strong friends and mentors , up to and including his father , to call upon .
And here 's a fair old irony .
For all Charles Spencer 's populist talk at that sad , mad funeral , of "" the boys "" needing "" more than one mentor "" in the coming years , meaning not just Charles , it has , actually , been Charles and the family behind every wise decision ; and father and son are now immense friends .
The royals ignored Spencer , and the tabloid shrieks , and did , as they always did , their own just - wise - enough thing , to survive ; and have produced a viable heir , better than might have been hoped for : a posh - boy with the common touch , and a warm if rather Sloaney sense of humour .
Not that it 's been a hard , hard life .
There has been , of course , frankly insane privilege .
Never mind the money , the travel , the experiences , the pretty girls , the loopily posh showing - off in personal helicopters and the like , the expensive tastelessness of favoured clubs .
You just need to remember that , when he did his A - level art history project on da Vinci , he was able to refer to his family 's own personal collection : a normal life this has not been .
Also , he might one day get to be king , which is nice , surely .
And he inherits Â£9 m of his own ( from Diana ) when 30 .
Set against that , the downsides .
Whether he decides to retreat with a certain haughtiness or be glad - handingly and taboo - breakingly "" normal "" , he will face constant sniping and attention , for the rest of his life , from three of this country 's nastiest groupings : tabloid press , jealous courtiers , and west - London snobs .
Is it worth it ?
Is it all , in the end , worth it ?
Never mind Charles 's dilemma ; this is the one which has dogged every single royal since Victoria ."
2010-01-15,"In retrospect , the two young women drinking lattes outside the Vulcan coffee bar off Auckland 's Queen Street may not have been the best people to ask about New Zealanders ' attitude to the monarchy . ""
Prince William ? ""
one said , "" Is he the one with the chubby cheeks , or the one with red hair ? ""
After this weekend she might have less excuse for ignorance .
This Sunday , William , who one day may be monarch of New Zealand , Australia and 13 other countries as well as the United Kingdom , opens a new chapter in the royals ' saga on his first official overseas visit , during which he will stand in for his grandmother in opening the new supreme court building in Wellington .
That in itself is a sign of change : New Zealand 's judicial decisions are no longer subject to appeal to the privy council 12,000 miles away .
New Zealand television company TVNZ is doing its best to stir up excitement . ""
Will Prince William revive our fervour for the royals ? "" , its website wonders as if not entirely certain , adding hopefully : "" While the older royals are a bit of a bore , it must be said that the prince is pretty hot stuff . ""
TVNZ is asking Prince William fans , "" or anyone hoping to catch a glimpse of him "" , to email in ; though whether its decision to screen the movie The Queen Sunday evening is entirely tactful , concerning as it does the monarchy 's reaction to the death of Princess Diana , William 's mother , is less clear .
The prince 's five - day trip will take him from Auckland to Wellington then , unofficially , to Sydney and Melbourne .
For the royal family it will be a test of how the 27-year - old prince performs and a key to his future marketing skills as he trips from one event to another : meeting the All Blacks here , touring a hospital there ; greeting Australian troops fresh from service in Afghanistan and survivors of last February 's disastrous bush fires ; enjoying a barbecue with the New Zealand prime minister and lunch with Australia 's governor general .
In the words of Major Jamie Lowther - Pinkerton , his private secretary , it is "" an instance of Her Majesty seeing an opportunity for her grandson to learn the ropes "" .
Just as important , he is not his father .
Prince Charles is not widely esteemed in either country , seen as too stuffy , too English , too rotten to Diana and too critical of the environmental cost of agricultural exports to Britain .
So William provides a chance for the monarchy to redefine itself in a more youthful fashion in countries where the trend towards republicanism has been stronger than anywhere else in the Commonwealth .
The moment could be propitious because the debate in both countries has stalled .
In 1999 Australians voted by a narrow margin not to abandon the monarchy , but then last month the conservative opposition party replaced its pro - republican leader Malcolm Turnbull with Tony Abbott , a man who says he will always be a monarchist .
The Melbourne Age recently bemoaned : "" It 's highly likely that after the Queen 's death the Australian ethos of the ' fair go ' will probably deliver the next monarch . ""
New Zealand is unlikely to move before Australia .
The former New Zealand prime minister Jim Bolger , himself a committed republican , told the Guardian : "" The prince will be very welcome â€ “ no drama whatsoever .
The future of the monarchy is a pretty low - level priority .
It 's just a matter of time and generational change . ""
That infuriates committed republican campaigners .
Lewis Holden , an Auckland IT consultant who chairs the New Zealand movement , said : "" The royal family come over here every five years and the premise that they are essential to the functioning of the state is nonsense .
We have had a working government since 1853 and it is a stretch to say that the monarchy had much to do with creating it . ""
Across the Tasman Sea , General Mike Keating , chair of the Australian republican movement , said : "" William 's having a two - day familiarisation visit here , tacked on to going to New Zealand .
Give me a break
â€ “ what 's he going to learn about a country of 5 million square miles in that time ?
Here 's someone who 's not been here since he was a baby , who could one day be our head of state .
How can he possibly empathise or understand ?
It sounds to me like he 's another 27-year - old having a holiday with his mates . ""
But the pro - monarchists feel they are on a roll .
"" I think there is a positive virtue in having a head of state 12,000 miles away , "" said Noel Cox , professor of constitutional law at Auckland University of Technology and chairman of Monarchy New Zealand .
"" It means we do n't have to worry about them and we effectively have a crowned republic already . ""
Thomas Flynn , Abbott 's successor as executive director of Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy , said : "" They can come here as often as they like .
People say Australians do n't like Prince Charles and would n't like Camilla , but if they got to know her , I think they 'd change their mind - she likes a drink and a smoke ,
so I think she 's very Australian in character .
"" William may be spared the attentions of Sam Bracanov .
The octogenarian Croatian immigrant who once sprayed Charles with air freshener "" ... to get rid of the stench of royalty "" , has turned to spraying local politicians instead .
The last time the Queen came , the authorities made a deal with him : the police would supply him with an aerosol can providing he only used it after she had passed .
For now that just leaves the 800 members of the NZ republican movement emailing TVNZ to say no , they do n't want to see the prince ."
2010-01-17,"Yesterday was day one of Prince William 's attempt to portray himself as a regular guy during his first official visit to New Zealand , and he found himself greeted at the airport by the country 's prime minister , given a warm welcome by the All Blacks rugby team and allowed to take an America 's Cup yacht for sail round Auckland harbour .
The omens were not immediately auspicious .
His arrival â€ “ by business class on a scheduled flight
â€ “ was greeted by an editorial in yesterday 's Star Times with the message : "" William 's charm can not disguise the fact that the system which produced him is rotten . ""
Still , at least it said he was n't a prat like his father .
The prince , a rugby fan , was taken to Eden Park stadium , where he stood while the city 's under-10s squad trained with the national side .
Invited to pass the ball among a circle of the youngsters , he immediately received it with unexpected force in the groin , before inciting them to try their aim on the circling cameramen instead .
"" We got him in the crown jewels , "" 10-year - old Ryan Wallace proudly told the local television channel afterwards .
But the young players ' verdict was nevertheless encouraging : "" Pretty cool , he 's got a very good accent , "" said one .
The prince later gave a television interview , telling the questioner who asked what he thought of New Zealand : "" It 's fantastic .
I love it , "" adding loyally for his grandmother 's sake :
"" I want to do something good and keep the standards up that she has led the way with . ""
His advisers confirmed that the itinerary was shaped by the prince and the speeches he will give here and in Australia â€ “ to where he moves on Tuesday â€
“ have also received his input .
Then he boarded SailNZ , the 24-metre ( 78 ft ) yacht that represented New Zealand in the 1995 America 's Cup , to help raise the sails and take a turn at the wheel .
Later the prince flew to New Zealand 's capital , Wellington , where he was greeted with a Maori Powhiri welcome outside the country 's futuristic new supreme court .
Dressed in a Maori bird feather cloak , he rubbed noses with four tribal elders .
A small demonstration by pro - republican supporters was noisily outnumbered by justice department staff protesting about pay , though there was also a banner held up by a young hopeful saying : "" Marry me , William .
End my poverty . """
2010-01-18,"On the second day of Prince William 's first official visit overseas , to New Zealand , he finally met a local who did n't want to meet him .
In his case it was a drowsy Little Spotted Kiwi , rooted out of its undergrowth habitat and nocturnal routine the previous evening and kept in a box to be introduced to the prince on his visit to the astonishingly beautiful Kapiti Island reserve .
The 2,000-acre ( 800-hectare ) island , off the coast of North Island , near Wellington , is fiercely protected , with restricted public access , as the last home of several bird species unique to the country , among them 1,200 Little Spotteds , the flightless blue and green Takahe parrot and the fiercely acquisitive Wekas , small brown birds not averse , like many at tourist destinations , to relieving visitors of anything shiny .
The prince 's kiwi , about the size of a small chicken , is the smallest of the six sub - Â­species of the bird and it deployed its defences against the unwelcome intrusion of visitors by unleashing a small shower of feathers , a move designed to distract attention .
It is a tactic royals could perhaps consider deploying for themselves .
As it was , the prince , gingerly holding the kiwi upside down , merely turned to the accompanying flock of press photographers and beamed knowingly :
"" At last â€ “ me with a kiwi bird . ""
They knew what he meant .
Having received its few minutes of fame , the bird was allowed to scuttle back into the bush .
Earlier in the day there had been no shortage of human inhabitants eager to meet the prince after he had officially opened the new supreme court building in Wellington â€ “ the ostensible purpose of the whole five - day trip .
The 27-year - old prince was standing in for his grandmother for the first time in inaugurating the building , part of the palace 's plan that he should take on more public engagements in future , in tandem with his training to be an air sea rescue helicopter pilot .
Beadily watching him make his first , assured and competent speech , from the second row in the public seats , was none other than Christopher Geidt , the Queen 's private secretary .
"" I am just here on holiday and it was suggested I might like to look in , "" Geidt said , somewhat unconvincingly .
"" I am not in shorts or anything , "" he added , unnecessarily as he was dressed in a business suit .
"" Not even keeping an eye , "" he added , in response to the obvious question .
Outside the court a crowd of several thousand had gathered by the time William left the building , with enthusiasts outnumbering protesters against the monarchy many times over .
Indeed the few republicans present were also heavily outnumbered by a rival , noisy demonstration by court workers protesting about their working conditions .
The prince embarked on a prolonged walkabout , insisting he did not wish to disappoint any of those waiting , and cheerily shook hands , received bouquets of flowers , posed for pictures and engaged small , star - struck infants in conversation as if he had been doing it all his life .
There was even a touch of his grandfather : "" What are you doing here , you slackers ?
"" he called to a group of officer workers , but , lacking Prince Philip 's strange ethereal charm , he did it without causing offence .
The prince only blanched once , when a mother thrust a spectacularly grubby infant in his direction with the injunction to "" kiss my baby "" .
"" I 'm not allowed â€ “
it 's protocol , "" he replied hastily .
The crowd all thought the prince was lovely , gorgeous but worried about the lack of sun block on his balding head in the fierce morning sun .
William will fly on to Sydney and Melbourne tomorrow for an unofficial visit , albeit one where he will meet the Australian prime minister , Kevin Rudd , in a late - scheduled meeting ."
2010-01-19,
2010-01-19,"Prince William today found himself confronted by an issue a mere member of the royal family can not possibly hope to solve , however high the expectations : that of Australian aboriginal rights .
The prince had been in Sydney for less than five hours when , during a visit to a community centre for Aborigines in the inner - city suburb of Redfern , he was handed a petition calling for the monarch 's intervention to improve aboriginal living conditions .
The petition was originally intended for his great - grandfather George VI in 1937 , but was never delivered .
Elders also wanted to ask William to secure the return to Australia of a 19th century tribal leader 's skull , reputed to be in England .
Expectations were clearly high that the 27-year - old , who is second - in - line to the throne , could meet both demands , with sentiment apparently strong among elders that he should be the next king instead of his father , Charles .
Confronted by the demands , the prince could only nod his concern and pass the petition to an official .
Lyall Munro , who handed the petition to the prince , said the Australian government had lost the original document after it was presented in August 1937 and it had never been passed on .
"" Our situation has not changed in 73 years , our people are still living in abject poverty .
We expect to create dialogue with this young man , who is the only member of his family who has registered an interest to come and see us , "" he said .
Michael Mundine , the elder who had promised to ask the prince to ensure the skull 's return , said afterwards it had not been the appropriate place to raise the issue , but he hoped William might be the one to bring it about .
"" He carries his mother 's heart and soul in his body and we know his concern for disadvantaged people .
He could be our next king , "" he said .
The prince was on the first day of an unofficial three - day visit to Australia , following his first official visit to New Zealand earlier in the week .
During his last engagement in New Zealand at a Wellington hospital this morning , the prince gained an inkling of the regard the region 's indigenous populations still have for the monarch .
Sam Jackson , a Maori elder , welcomed him outside the entrance as "" the grandson of the white heron "" .
Reference to this rare , symbolic bird â€ “ down to its last 120 in New Zealand after being all but eliminated for the use of its feathers in women 's hats last century
â€ “ is apparently the greatest tribute that could be paid to the Queen .
The bird flies a long way to reach the country , which also applies to the Queen , but she may feel less happy to be compared to a creature on the verge of extinction .
Serious demands aside , the prince spent the rest of his day in amiable conversation with a range of potential future subjects : from children and their parents in the hospital to the elderly Aborigines in Redfern , who showered him with presents .
The prince seemed moved by their generosity , telling one woman : "" That 's really kind .
I did n't bring you anything . ""
What he did give them was his attention and his time â€ “ overrunning by nearly an hour at the centre to leave the governor of New South Wales waiting .
In return , the people queued to have their photographs taken with him .
With a "" course you can my loves "" , and a demotic "" no worries "" , he happily put his arms around their shoulders and squeezed in tight for the pictures .
When Ali Golding , 67 , showed the prince pictures of herself with the Queen and Princess Anne on previous occasions , William told her : "" You look as if you have met more of my family than I have "" .
Thrilled with the latest addition to her collection , Golding said : "" I think he is excellent , a real human being ; really down to earth and inspirational .
He has the spirit and character of his mother â€ “ as long as he exists , she does too .
"" There was no republican fervour in sight â€ “ and precious little in the Australian media , which has given the visit copious amounts of coverage .
As for the petition , it will go straight to the governor - general , the powers of the great white prince being more limited than perhaps the Aborigines would like to imagine ."
2010-01-21,"Prince William spent his last full day in Australia today touring the area of the state of Victoria devastated by bushfires nearly a year ago .
He was clearly moved and shocked by survivors ' tales of the devastating fires which swept through the hilly , wooded country at speeds of up to 100 mph on Black Saturday – 7 February 2009 – leaving 173 people dead and destroying 430,000 hectares of woods and pastureland .
The survivors told him that on the day of devastating heat , on which temperatures reached 47C before the bush ignited , many of them had only minutes to leave their homes and escape .
Sparks from the fire were carried several kilometres on the wind to ignite blazes in new areas at high speed .
The hills are still blackened with thousands of charred eucalyptus trees dotting the landscape , but there are also clear signs of regeneration , not only in the undergrowth but with leaves beginning to grow once more from the blackened stumps .
One family , Colin and Michelle French who ran an educational centre at Kinglake , showed the prince their washing line – the only part of their property not to be destroyed .
It still has a polo shirt hanging from it , which is immovable because the heat melted the plastic of the line and welded it to the spot .
At another village , Whittlesea , the prince hugged some of those he met .
They had been told to expect a special event but not told that he was coming .
One of those meeting the prince , Richard Fox , who lost his home in the fire , said : "" It 's a privilege .
It does mean a lot to the people that have been affected .
We are pleased by the continued interest from the royal family and Prince William today . ""
The prince also met residents of the village of Flowerdale , where a third of the homes were destroyed and 13 people died .
The village has set up emergency temporary accommodation for the homeless on the side of the local cricket pitch and is working hard with philanthropic donations and aid from the state of Victoria to rebuild all the homes – the first family moved back into a rebuilt property within 17 days of the fire .
Also present in the village yesterday were four Australian sporting icons : test cricketers Matthew Hayden , Michael Hussey , Brett Lee and Brad Hodge , signing autographs , giving away bats and rucksacks to the children and taking part in a pick - up game with the youngsters on the ground 's artificial pitch .
Inevitably , William was invited to take part and , protesting that he was no good , sent down a passably straight full - toss at Hayden who , in contrast to his normal hard - hitting manner in test cricket , batted it gently into the covers .
Then the prince was asked to bat and , using a plastic bat against the tennis ball bowled by a succession of youngsters , showed that , if nothing else , he learned to play a straight bat on the playing fields of Eton .
They did n't get him out , so at least one Ashes encounter could count as a draw .
The outback villagers , enjoying a barbecue in shorts and T - shirts on a hot day , though one not nearly as hot as last year , pronounced the prince a good bloke for coming .
John Burgess , who chairs the village recovery committee , said : "" We have seen more dignitaries in the past year than we would have expected to see in a lifetime .
The prince 's visit is a brief distraction to what is going on here , but it has given a lot of people some fun time . ""
The prince returns home from what has been a highly successful five days in New Zealand and Australia this evening and will resume his training to become an RAF air sea rescue helicopter pilot on Monday ."
2010-01-22,"In the end the lure of celebrity proved just too much .
The arrival of the diffident 27-year - old Old Etonian , who might conceivably one day become their monarch , provoked sneers in Australia before he touched down on Tuesday .
But by last night he had been transformed from Willy the Wombat into â€ “ acccording to the tabloid Herald Sun â€ “ a Dinkum Aussie Larrikin .
You could go a long way through the Outback to find someone less like a larrikin ( which usually translates as a bit of a hoodlum ) , but that 's what the presence of royalty can do for you .
Many thousands turned out to see the prince here in Australia and in New Zealand earlier in the week .
Outside the new supreme court building in Wellington , which William had been sent to open on behalf of his grandmother , people greeted him with cheers and worried about the effect of the sun on his bald spot .
Maoris beamed with pleasure that the grandson of the Great White Heron had come amongst them .
In Sydney , Aborigines who spend their lives crammed into a dismal slum area called the Block came out in their thousands to welcome a young man as different from them as it is possible to imagine .
William 's gay fanbase turned out in "" I Love Willy "" T - shirts .
And he did not disappoint .
Like his mother before him , William hugged babies in hospital wards and spontaneously put his arms around elderly Aboriginal ladies .
He listened gravely to survivors of last February 's devastating Victoria bushfires .
He joshed the parachute squaddies of the 3rd battalion Royal Australian Regiment on their firing range , where his shooting proficiency provoked genuine admiration .
So , as he and his advisers flew back home last night â€ “ business class on a scheduled flight , not by private jet like some royals â€
“ they will undoubtedly feel buoyed up by success .
They may even have been chortling gently that the pro - republican Melbourne Age noted yesterday , under the headline "" All - round Good Egg William Snares Many with his Charm Offensive "" , that the prince "" may have done more to set back the republican cause than anything since the 1999 referendum "" â€ “ which , of course , the republicans narrowly lost .
That is good news indeed for Buckingham Palace and , across the road , Clarence House , home of William 's father Prince Charles .
Because William is the best hope they have .
Things are looking bleak for the monarchy right now .
There is n't much stardust around for the foreseeable future : the Queen is approaching her mid-80s and , with no sign of ill health , may be good for another decade or ( if she has inherited her mother 's longevity ) two .
Her famously grumpy heir , Charles , is now 61 ; he will already be an old man when he inherits .
So it is to the next generation the family must turn , even though William , already approaching his 30s , will probably be middle - aged by the time he is crowned .
All the more reason , therefore , to pay attention to the prince 's progress as he finally , by taking on grown - up engagements of this sort , begins to take the burden off the oldsters .
This week was the first time that he has undertaken an official overseas tour ( at least so far as the New Zealand leg of the trip was concerned ) and , as fate would have it , it was to two countries that have been murmuring for years about dispensing with the monarch and having their own home - grown head of state .
No wonder then that accompany- ing the prince was a small , elite team whose job it was to keep him from gaffes and pitfalls .
Major Jamie Lowther - Pinkerton , the leathery , hatchet - faced former SAS man who is the prince 's private secretary , was to be seen alongside him , glowering as he was handed yet another bouquet of flowers to carry ( the flowers having been thrust at the prince during his walkabouts ) .
Beside him , equally discreet , was Sir David Manning , the former diplomat whose career peaked as Tony Blair 's foreign affairs adviser and then ambassador to the US during the period after the Iraq war .
A small grey figure , he could be seen standing slightly apart from the crowd , quizzically viewing the prince , with whom he has a part - time advisory role .
If every would - be monarch needs a mentor , Manning , who spent 36 years at the Foreign Office , fills that role .
There were also three security police , a young press officer and a secretarial assistant , but this was not all : watching beadily from the public seats as William opened the New Zealand supreme court was none other than Christopher Geidt , the Queen 's private secretary .
Clearly uncomfortable at being spotted , he protested that he had only dropped by because he happened to be in Wellington : "" I am just on holiday and it was suggested I might like to look in .
"" What all these helpers , official or otherwise , will have reported back to senior royals was how well William did .
He was charming , empathetic , approachable and informal .
He smiled and told jokes , he listened seriously and engaged with what people told him , he was clearly moved by the victims of the bushfires and he asked serious questions , beyond the "" Do you come here often ? "" that so many of the royals use as a substitute for conversation .
He also wore informal clothes â€ “ Asics trainers and cords and open - necked shirts
â€ “ some of them the same two days running .
In short , how unlike the life of his own dear father , who needs a valet on tours and has been known to change suits several times a day .
William even mingled with the press , albeit briefly , in a bar by Auckland harbour .
I 'd like to tell you what he said
but , of course , it was all off the record , though he clearly knew the tabloid correspondents well and enjoyed the game of evading their attentions .
Not surprisingly , they like him very much .
It would be difficult not to .
And the stardust rubbed off .
Here 's Ali Williams , towering All Blacks skunk - haired lock forward : "" He 's got to do what he 's got to do â€
“ he 's only human , is n't he ? ""
And another Ali : Aunty Ali Golding , a 67-year - old Aboriginal woman from the Block who has met the Queen and Princess Anne and showed William photographs to prove it .
"" You look as though you have met more of my family than I have , "" he told her .
She said afterwards : "" I think he 's excellent in his mannerisms
â€ “ a real human being .
His spirit was really down - to - earth .
He 's got the character and spirit of his mother and as long as he exists , she will .
I think he would be a most excellent king . ""
And here is a middle - aged , unshaven chap in vest and shorts , living in a cabin in the outback village of Flowerdale after his house burned down in last year 's disastrous bushfire , who said to me : "" Look at that â€ “ he shook my hand ! ""
As William flies back , perhaps he will reflect that the royal duty that he speaks about will involve encounters and lobbying and receptions and barbecues and walkabouts and meetings with politicians and governors and prime ministers for the rest of his life .
It is part of what monarchs do and always have done .
What he will also know is that he will have to endure puerile analysis of everything he does .
This week , there was the intense textual analysis that went on among the tabloids about whether he had really said he gets "" the piss "" taken out of him about his taste in music ( he had , the BBC tape picked up as much ) and whether anyone would be shocked or outraged by such an expression in this day and age .
Or the picture of him emerging from the gents ' toilet at the army range that the Melbourne Age saw fit to print yesterday with the caption : "" Royal flush . . .
even royalty has to go . ""
Then , of course , there will be the endless speculation about if and when he will marry his girlfriend Kate Middleton . ""
Wait and see
, "" he said airily this week , a remark sufficiently ambiguous to prompt more exegesis .
So what have we learned of Prince William ?
Well , his taste in music , that gets the aforementioned piss taken out of him , turns out to include Linkin Park and Kanye West ; that he believes he has no taste in clothes , though Harry 's is worse ; that he is a good shot and bad at table tennis ( and even worse at Wii tennis ) ; that he can keep a straight bat at cricket .
And that his bald spot â€ “ the subject of much Australian mirth and New Zealand concern â€ “ is growing fast .
We have learned , too , that the public is interested in him and that royalty can still produce fawning . ""
God bless you William , "" the Aborigines cried as they queued up to have their photographs taken with him .
( "" Course you can , my loves , "" he told them and , lapsing into the demotic , "" No worries . "" )
A palace aide said last night : "" I would not like to say whether we achieved the objective of giving him the chance of getting to know the people of these countries , but he has been incredibly gratified by the welcome he has received .
It was a very successful tour and he enjoyed every moment .
"" Does this turn back the long - term republican tide in Australia and New Zealand ?
Of course not : even though the impetus is currently lacking , a majority of both populations seems to want republicanism and Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd 's spokeswoman this week suggested that , if Rudd 's Labour government is re - elected later this year , it will initiate a debate "" in due season "" .
The fact is that celebrity and the royal touch will not sway everyone .
As Professor George Williams of New South Wales University and the national committee of the Australian republican movement wrote this week in the Sydney Morning Herald : "" Having Prince William as our future king represents a failure , not on his part , but of ourselves . """
2010-01-22,"Have you been following the royal tour of Australia and New Zealand ?
No , nor have I.
For me
it 's a bit like the football .
I rarely watch it except on the big occasions , but I like to keep an eye on the score .
Arsenal have had a good week , but so has Prince William , who is the touring royal on this occasion .
The Guardian 's Stephen Bates has a characteristically shrewd assessment in today 's G2 .
It seems the balding boy has scored a hit despite the healthily sceptical view of many young people â€ “ especially in assertive Australia â€ “ towards the monarchy and the Poms .
Does it matter that he got good press ?
Was kissed by a lot of girls and dubbed Willy the Wombat by the tabloids ?
Or proved hopeless at cricket and table tennis , but an impressively good marksman handling an F88 Austeyr rifle , the personal weapon of the Australian squaddie , despite never having fired one before ?
Probably not a great deal in the larger scheme of things on a day when Barack Obama has finally rolled his sleeves up to take on Wall Street and Gordon Brown is being dragged in chains ( he put them on himself ) before Sir John Chilcot 's inquiry .
But if William has demonstrated he can do this sort of tour â€ “ and connect with people at least half as well as his mum did â€ “ on his first big outing , it keeps the monarchy in the game , in Britain as much as down under .
As you may dimly recall , the Australians had a referendum on the monarchy in 1999 , one which the republican side confidently expected to win .
But they were hopelessly divided , you could say carelessly so , on what they wanted to put in place of Her Majesty â€ “ Mrs Betty GlÃ¼cksburg to them , I suppose .
As Wikipedia University 's note briefly explains here , the republican minimalists wanted an appointed head of state , while more radical critics wanted a directly elected one chosen by the people .
In the end the monarchists and the "" if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it "" faction prevailed .
In today 's Times , Malcolm Turnbull , briefly Australia 's Liberal ( ie Tory ) leader until the climate change coup by Tony Abbott last month , sets out a genial case for eventual change .
We like the Poms , we were delighted to welcome Prince William , but the world has changed and Australia is now a more independent , sovereign nation than Britain , which belongs to the EU , he chirped .
Fine ; he 's probably right about the underlying republican mood of his country .
Americans enjoy British royalty without any wish to invite them back .
Turnbull campaigned for a republic with his Labour opponent of an earlier generation , Gough Whitlam â€
“ victim of the famous governor general 's coup which ended his premiership in 1975 .
So did ex - Liberal PM Malcolm Fraser and most of the Australian media , whom the late Bill Deedes accused of running a sustained and biased narrative against the crown .
Nothing new in that , nor in voters ignoring a bent narrative either .
Turnbull 's case is that when the Queen eventually dies â€ “ 10 years , 20 years ?
Bates muses in G2
â€ “ will be the appropriate time for Australia to decide its destiny and for New Zealand to follow in its big cousin 's wake or make one of its periodic assertions of independence .
But that is surely right for us too ?
Britain has solid reserves of republican sentiment .
Wide rather than deep , I suspect they include most of the Labour cabinet as well as all sorts of overeducated north London types to whom no sensible person would lend a fiver .
Me , I 'm an "" if it ai n't broke "" man .
The idea of having an hereditary titular president as both a symbol and focus of national unity strikes me as perfectly sensible , far less fuss than having to choose between Cheryl Cole and Alex Ferguson every five years .
If we do n't like them , we can always send them their P45 .
That 's been the explicit understanding since the coup â€ “ a lot of coups in this story â€ “ of 1689 that sent the Stuarts packing , most of them , hopeless , scheming incompetents .
Good riddance .
We 've had a steady stream of mostly dull Germans ever since and not much fuss .
Princess Diana 's turbulent gene pool injects a note of future uncertainty into the system , but also some overdue glamour .
It 's a trade - off .
We 'll see ; plenty of time .
So how William Wales â€ “ or is that GlÃ¼cksburg , grandad 's family name ?
â€ “ does in Oz matters .
His father can be rather tiresome .
Waiting a lifetime to inherit a job vacancy you may never get would be bad for anyone 's nerves , which is another thing he has in common with Gordon Brown , on top of a bad temper and self - pity .
At best Charlie Windsor is a transitional figure , but he will have to survive demands for a referendum here too .
A lot will depend on the mood of the country â€ “ angry or fearful ?
â€ “ and who is in power at the time .
But Wills is the man to watch .
This past week seems to shown he can handle the public side of the job , grisly though it must be being kissed quite so often by girls ( and their mothers ) .
That 's an interesting development , important even .
There again , the prince may be a moderniser too .
He may not want it ."
2010-02-07,"This was a first , albeit perhaps not the first that 02 , sponsors of the England rugby team , might have hoped for .
The title of first ever live broadcast 3D sports event was gazumped from beneath their digital feet last weekend by Sky 's guerrilla pub screening of Arsenal v Manchester United .
Instead O2 's 3D presentation of England v Wales to 900 paying customers across 40 Cineworld theatres had to settle for other kinds of first : the first time Prince William 's bald patch has come lurching off the screen in shimmering , heart - rending 10-metre close - up ; and the first real big ticket , arena - style event of its type .
It turned out to be a spectacular experience , and certainly the most high spec and breathlessly , pointlessly contemporary means of watching a semi - decent game of rugby yet conceived .
When all this was first announced there was much ironical waggery based around the idea of Martin Johnson 's hitherto constipated England playing "" three - dimensional "" rugby .
This was taken to be a televisual oxymoron along the lines of Channel Five news , or The Best of French and Saunders .
But it turns out rugby union – and rugby union played the England way – is well suited to 3D.
The international game has long been a geometric business , a quest for the patch of space .
The players are basically cuboid .
They look alarmingly solid in 3D , at least when they 're standing still .
In the loose , with bodies appearing from curious angles , there was something spectral about it , like a Victorian ghost hoax .
Cinema has yet to solve the problem of 3D glasses ( instead the glasses have been made - over into a glossy aviator homage ) so we filed into our multiplex seats like 250 jazz drummers , or 250 nightclub barflies .
The idea of all this is to replicate a "" stadium experience "" and there was a matey rowdiness about the place .
They even stood up for the national anthem .
And pretty soon it became clear 3D might even be a panacea for rugby 's cinematic achilles heel : the amount of time spent watching a tiny ball being booted into the clouds .
A period of aerial ping - pong in the first half frankly leapt off the screen .
Jonny Wilkinson 's opening penalty actually , properly sailed between the posts .
Who needs flair ?
Who needs the 30-metre break ?
We have meticulously detailed ball - hoofing and an unusual clarity of slow - ball ruck .
Sport certainly seems hungry for this kind of thing .
It is , we 're told by industry analysts , the future .
Although perhaps surprisingly the twin - camera technology used is essentially no different from that employed by the makers of Jaws 3 to make it look like you were about to be nuzzled by a big rubber shark .
Still , 3D is being visibly repositioned as the next big thing .
Fifa recently announced that 25 matches at the summer 's World Cup will be shot in 3D. Sky are launching a 3D cinema channel and considering a sports one , too .
Optimistic digital salesmen estimate a million 3D sets will be sold in the next three years .
The cinema projection aspect does seem to be part of a trend .
Successive generations of new media have had a boomeranging effect on how we experience sport .
From the atomised armchair fan of the immediate satellite sports boom , increasingly technology seems eager to network us into plastic communities .
You can even watch football now mic'd up to fellow consumers on your Xbox , mimicking the casual familiarity of the season - ticket stand .
And the view from row J of the Shaftesbury Avenue Cineworld in London did have some of the communal essence of the actual experience .
But really the 3D was the thing , a genuinely absorbing way to watch a fairly tight and compressed game of rugby .
There were some double takes , too .
As England scored their try at the end of the first half a man with a bag of bottles ran out from behind my left eye , down my nose and started talking to Steve Borthwick .
Nearby a woman screamed .
Take that , Jaws 3 ."

2010-03-10,"In his wildest dreams during years of homelessness , Paul Kelly would never have envisaged that photographs taken by him would one day hang alongside rarely seen works by such giants of the art world as Helmut Newton , Irving Penn , Richard Avedon and Henri Cartier - Bresson .
Three of Kelly 's photographs have been selected for a major exhibition that includes more than 100 rare and signed works , and which opens today in the splendour of Somerset House in central London .
The most collectable photos will be auctioned next month in aid of homelessness charity Crisis – among them a royal diptych comprising a portrait of Prince William , the charity 's patron .
Kelly , 57 , started out as a hairdresser in Bristol , then led an eclectic life as a community worker minding school gates against razor - toting crack dealers , putting on fledgling graffiti artist Banksy 's first show , as a DJ , and as a musician .
He became homeless three years ago when he moved to Newcastle upon Tyne to fulfil his dream of going to university .
But as an older single man without a family or dependent children , Kelly was not classed as "" priority need "" for housing by the council and was forced to sleep on friends ' sofas or try to find a space in a hostel for homeless people .
After spending three months "" sofa surfing "" , he lived in a hostel for five months , which he says was "" emotionally draining "" .
He heard about Crisis 's new Skylight centre in Newcastle , where he learned to type and developed his photography skills .
Now he is in the final year of a photography degree , looking forward to his pictures rubbing frames with the greats in London .
Kelly says being selected among several homeless people to show his work in the exhibition , A Positive View , is a great honour . ""
Since Crisis helped me , I have discovered a lot about fine art photography , which I feel has put me in good stead for this exhibition , "" he says .
"" Very few photographers get an opportunity like this . ""
The exhibition 's theme is the collision of opposites , bringing together ultra - chic high - fashion shots with raw images such as Kelly 's Fifty Pence Diptych Part 1 and Part 2 , which depict the aftermath of fights .
Of Part 2 , he says : "" The subject was beaten up by another girl and had come to Crisis to get away from the situation .
I liked her determined look and strong ironic smile . ""
The title is a parody of one of the most expensive photographs in the world : Andreas Gursky 's 99 Cent II Diptychon , which sold for over $ 3 m in 2007 .
Kelly says he hopes that the exhibition will "" highlight the need for more affordable housing .
Power to the people . ""

2010-04-08,"It 's a fine time to be a Daily Telegraph reader .
The newspaper is already spearheading the Conservative election campaign ( someone has to ) , by collecting businesses critical of the government 's proposed National Insurance rise , and giving their spokespeople plenty of space to warn of the doom and gloom such a catastrophic move will cause .
But it is also busy organising suitably Conservative post - election feel - good events – or at least willing them into being .
A theory expounded by former Vanity Fair editor Tina Brown , which says that June 3 and 4 have been "" mysteriously blocked out on the palace diaries "" , has been seized upon by the newspaper with great enthusiasm .
The lack of supermarket openings and charity inspections can only mean that the announcement of a royal engagement is imminent .
So , William and Kate announce the happy event just as parliament has settled down again after the election , and tie the knot just as the natives are getting really restless , six months in .
Wonderful stuff
– it 's like the last hundred years did n't happen , but better .
No doubt those among us who do n't already possess 50 in high- definition flat - screens will be getting our orders in"
2010-05-12,"As the ruptured BP well relentlessly haemorrhages oil into the Gulf of Mexico , experts now predict that by mid - June , the spill will exceed the amount the Exxon Valdez unleashed on Prince William Sound in 1989 when it dumped 10.9 million gallons of Prudhoe Bay crude into Alaskan waters , the biggest spill in US history .
And while some records just are n't meant to be broken , it turns out we 're quietly breaking this one year after year .
According to the Environmental Protection Agency , as people across the US refuel their leaf blowers and lawnmowers , we slop approximately 17 million gallons of gasoline onto the ground each summer , gas that seeps into the water we drink and evaporates into the air we breathe .
Ah , leaf blowers .
Each year , approximately 6 million US households purchase the wind - blowing noise machines .
The shrill tool du jour for groundskeepers have caused many a quibble between neighbours , with numerous localities passing ordinances that proscribe its use .
But leaf blowers not only rankle upscale nimbys in search of quietude .
The machine 's influence extends much further .
In fact , leaf blowers have blustered their way into our collective conscience , making a significant imprint on how we think and relate to each other .
The leaf blower is not simply a garden tool you can drop on your foot , but a frame of mind .
It 's not so much that we impose our will on the leaf blower , making it do our work for us , as the leaf blower imposes its out - of - sight - out - of - mind reasoning on us .
Let 's call it "" leaf - blower logic "" .
Like fumes rising from the leaf blower and into the air for all to breathe and the atmosphere to choke on , leaf - blower logic clears a path for passing along unwelcome environmental and economic side - effects to the general public .
Economists rather clunkily call this "" externalising costs "" or "" externalities "" but they 're pinpointing the logic of the leaf blower , which transforms discrete social and political problems into everyone 's problems .
In effect , this socialises capitalism 's ugly underbelly , and without a democratic referendum .
Nowhere is leaf - blower logic more obvious right now than along the Gulf Coast , where a finger - pointing festival is temporarily relocating the epicentre of litigation nation to point south .
President Barack Obama has placed the blame for BP 's underwater oil geyser squarely on the corporation 's shoulders , asserting the firm will foot the entire clean - up bill . ""
BP is responsible for this leak .
BP will be paying the bill , "" he said .
If only it were that simple .
While BP is on the hook for direct clean - up costs , there 's also a law on the books , passed in the wake of the Exxon Valdez spill , that places a $ 75 m limit on non - clean - up liability damages .
For a company that earned more than $ 6bn in profits in the first quarter of 2010 alone , this is a drop in the corporate bucket .
No one 's more aware of this legalistic wriggle room than the BP CEO , Tony Hayward .
When he speaks you can almost hear the rev of a leaf blower ghosting in the background , readying to spread the costs to the general public .
He recently asserted BP would pay for "" legitimate "" claims , a notoriously slippery term from which legions of lawyers make their living .
More recently , Hayward has uttered unadulterated leaf - blower logic , claiming BP is actually not to blame : "" The real issue is the failure of the safety equipment , the critical safety equipment called the blowout preventer .
That is a piece of equipment owned and operated by Transocean , maintained by Transocean .
They are absolutely accountable for its safety and reliability . ""
Thankfully , however , leaf - blower logic is not inescapable .
To avoid future catastrophes of the Old Testament variety , the Obama administration obviously needs to revamp the leaf - blower - logic - laden oversight programme that 's supposedly keeping a watchful eye on offshore oil drilling .
For too long the Minerals Management Service – the regulatory unit within the interior department that oversees environmental reviews for offshore drilling projects – has acted like big oil 's own private rubber - stamp factory , waiving environmental analyses as if they were banal formalities without consequence .
But it turns out we can turn back the clock on leaf - blower logic , too .
Senator Robert Menendez and 11 co - sponsors have introduced a bill in the Senate they 're dubbing the "" big oil bailout prevention liability act "" .
The bill would hoist the liability cap to $ 10bn and make it retroactive to mid - April , just before the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion .
The Exxon Valdez - era law that limits liability to a measly $ 75 m should be seen as exhibit A of standard - issue pre - economic meltdown corporate pandering .
But we 're in the post - economic meltdown era now
and there 's no need to kowtow to the bigwigs anymore , especially when they 've botched things with such seismic ineptitude .
Congress has an opportunity to switch off the leaf blower and it should n't squander it ."
2010-06-18,"Once lampooned as the last academic domain of the workshy and the unimaginative , geography has experienced a sharp revival of its street credentials as environmentalism has entered the mainstream .
Following another unlikely boost when Prince William took it up while at university in the 1990s , courses are now often oversubscribed .
Geography comes in many forms – often including feminist , Marxist and post - structural approaches – but is most straightforwardly divided into human and physical strands .
Most courses feature some combination of both , allowing students to understand how communities interact with their physical environments .
Careers are not confined to specialisms , and employers value the many portable skills gained .
And as for geography students ' supposed lack of imagination , Roger McGough , the well - known Liverpool poet ( and geography graduate ) , might have something to say about that .
What skills have you gained ?
You 'll have developed strong analytical skills , knowing how to interpret conceptual and data - based information .
In a rapidly changing world your understanding of how human environments function globally and locally is highly marketable .
A knowledge of how to read future socio - economic trends and use computer modelling tools will be of interest to many employers .
To this end , your degree should have included a major piece of research , which will have allowed you to develop self - management skills , as well as important transferable attributes such as communication , presentation and team - working .
What jobs can you do ?
Geography graduates are equipped to move in several career directions , often combining their knowledge of human and environmental activity to work in areas such as town planning , travel and tourism or aspects of environmental protection , says Margaret Holbrough , careers adviser with Graduate Prospects .
"" Surveying , either in urban general practice or in planning / development are possibilities , as are jobs within the property industry , "" she says , but points out that postgraduate qualifications and/or prior experience are essential for many of these careers .
"" Logistics and distribution , international aid and development would be relevant career options , as well as working within local government departments or agencies responsible for transport and tourism , housing , environmental services and recycling , sustainability , regeneration and economic development , "" Holbrough says .
"" Jobs that utilise the analytical and research skills of human geography graduates include market research , law , finance and accounting . ""
Postgraduate study ?
A high number of geography - related careers require further study .
Within six months of graduating , 19 % of 2008 geography students returned to specialise in areas such as meteorology , environmental management and oceanography .
Popular careers such as urban planning , surveying and teaching require more study .
Business and management courses are other options .

2010-08-28,"There are strong rumours , seemingly emanating from Westminster Abbey , that Prince William and Kate Middleton will we d there next year .
If this turns out to be true , ca n't you just see those headlines : "" Waity Katie waits no more ! "" ; "" For Waity Katie the wait is over ! '
Not quite : "" Gold - digging upstart finally reels him in , and she 's not even preggers "" , but you get the gist .
It will be all about Kate Middleton snagging her prince .
Well , eventually .
Patience is indeed a virtue , with a diamond sparkler on top .
To which one might say : "" Oh stop putting up with it , Kate , and if you ever get the chance , jilt the arrogant blighter .
"" I do n't particularly care for Kate Middleton .
Like so many in the royal swirl , she 's always appeared safe , dull , a cookie - cutter , far too careful not to frighten the corgis .
That said , there 's been something undeniably nasty about Middleton 's treatment that says a lot about supposedly modern classless Britain .
As we all know , William 's mother received endless adulation and sympathy –
some deserved , some not , considering she could be a self - absorbed , mendacious piece of work .
By contrast , William 's squeeze at best , a royal doormat , at worst , idle , work - shy , on the make .
Read some of Middleton 's press and you could be forgiven for presuming that our heir to the throne was dithering over marrying into the cast of Shameless .
Is it her fault
she 's in this position ?
Yes , but it is also William 's .
In the light of his position , he 's rude and cruel to keep his woman waiting , thus subjecting her to public scrutiny and ridicule .
However , in real terms , the Waity jibe is unfair .
They met at university – did people seriously think they should get married at 21 , 22 or even 25 ?
But then , it 's not just about the wait with Kate .
As with so much in British life , even today , this is about class .
Her mother used to be an air hostess and now runs a party goods firm .
Hence , comes the background hiss , the Middletons must be a bunch of commoner upstarts .
Ergo , Kate should be made to wait or even fail completely .
The middle - class girl from Berkshire must atone for her social - climbing sins .
This attitude also abounds in the ordinary world .
When it comes to whom they choose to love , it 's as if women have to stay within precise , class - based cum financial boundaries or they 'll be instantly lumbered with the gold - digger tag .
With the royals , this attitude is deafening , but why ?
These days , it 's a farce if Waity Katie , or anyone , should be made to feel "" not good enough "" for one of the most dysfunctional families in Britain .
Indeed , what kind of marital hell awaits Middleton chez Windsor ?
Prince Philip looming up over the cornflakes with "" amusing "" remarks about foreigners ?
Prince Charles in his cups endlessly quoting The Goons and playing his Three Degrees casettes ?
With this in mind , who could blame Middleton if she 's secretly enamoured by the tiaras and the lifestyle ?
Quite apart from anything else , William has turned out to be pretty dull .
Not much of interest is ever likely to pop out of that rather petulant royal mouth .
Any bride of his would be wise to optimise the perks .
Of course , this could all be rubbish and there could be no wedding .
If there is n't , one imagines it will be because , like many university relationships , it has petered out .
Also , perhaps , because vicious , ingrained snobbery still runs through the UK .
If there is a big day , the best - case scenario would be for Kate to make it even bigger by jilting William at the altar and running away , out of the royal hell forever , screaming as she goes , loud and proud : "" I 'm a commoner , get me out of here ! ""
Oh , Gérard , you must stop letting your envy show It seems unfair to criticise Gérard Depardieu –
he already has to go about the world with a face like a sucked Dorito .
However , ranting about fellow French thespian Juliette Binoche , Depardieu said : "" I would really like to know why she has been so esteemed for so many years .
She has nothing .
Absolutely nothing . ""
To this , he added charmingly : "" She 's nobody .
She 's nothing .
"" They do n't get on , then ?
In fairness , Depardieu did praise actresses Isabelle Adjani and Fanny Ardant .
Still , what could possibly have inspired this ungallant attack on Binoche , a sweet and , most would say , talented actress ?
Some whisper of Oscar - envy ( Binoche 1 , Depardieu 0 ) .
Moreover , Binoche has a sense of quality - control , while Depardieu has been – how to put this politely ?
– "" more prolific "" .
He says himself : "" I 've made 200 films , of which 150 were [ insert rude Gallic word ] . ""
So self - awareness is n't a problem for Gérard , just that thing of randomly laying into actresses .
Mean - spirited cochon ( look it up ) .
The French film industry could do worse than to keep Depardieu even busier – he may have a bit too much time on those strange giant hands .
Recession denial – what a luxury Are some of us suffering from recession - blindness ?
It 's a condition similar to snow - blindness , but caused by staring at gloomy financial forecasts for so long that some people become blinded to reality .
A Mintel report says that many of us are refusing to give up "" little luxuries "" ; these range from hairdressers and beauty salons ( £ 5.34bn ) , new clothes ( £ 28.2bn ) , luxury bath items ( £ 580 m ) to eating out and takeaways ( £ 1.8bn ) .
This could be framed in two ways .
Optimistically : how wonderful to see the Blitz spirit alive and well , manifesting itself in a refusal to give up Molton Brown Energising Seamoss bath bubbles in hard times .
Less happily : "" Is that the takeaway delivery at the door ?
Hello , Mr Bailiff .
I was just enjoying an Energising Seamoss bubble bath .
I say , is it absolutely necessary to take the plasma television ? ""
In the report , we are told that luxuries feel essential , because , so far , less than half of the population feels worse off because of the recession , though many are very anxious about the year to come .
Hmm .
This indicates that many of us are merrily overspending and frittering , while saying : "" Next year looks really bad . ""
Come next year , what 's the betting we 'll be saying exactly the same thing ?
This is n't recession - blindness at all – a large swath of the nation appears to be engulfed in a state of outright recession - denial .
Sorry , but regardless of whether or not one is "" feeling it "" , the recession is here .
One ca n't hope to delay it to a vague "" next year "" , in the manner of an electronic food tray that feeds the cat while you 're away .
You 'd have to be an idiot to do that .
Or British .
It 's sweet to know that in times of hardship , the biggest consumer success story is rose - tinted spectacles ."
2010-09-28,"After a quarter of a century of experimentation and nurture , the harvest of 29 new varieties of English cider apples was taking place in the West Country today .
Rejoicing in names ranging from the explanatory ( the Early Bird ) to the downright cheeky –
the Prince William is named after the second in line to the throne because he is known to enjoy a tipple –
growers hope the new types will provide a fresh boost to the industry .
There are already hundreds of cider apple varieties , but the project , managed by the National Association of Cider Makers ( NACM ) , is designed to find better , juicier and more disease - resistant fruit .
Liz Copas , a consultant pomologist who has overseen the project and has had an apple ( Lizzy ) named in her honour , said harvest time was always important and exciting in the orchards of the UK , but this one could be even more significant .
"" We hope to prove the new fruit the offers growers and cider makers the best combination of juice quality and high yields , "" she added .
The cider industry has been one of the countryside 's triumphs over the last few years with 130 m gallons produced in the UK every year .
There was an outcry in the spring when the Labour government announced it was going to impose a sharp increase on cider duty .
The decision was later reversed .
While that row was taking place , the 29 new varieties of apples were ripening at three orchards in Somerset and Herefordshire .
Household names such as Bulmers and Thatchers are involved in the scheme , as are smaller concerns .
The fruit will be hand - picked , weighed and analysed before it is turned into cider and tasted .
NACM spokesman Simon Russell said : "" This work is really important for growers and cidermakers .
It also demonstrates that the industry is a long - term thing .
The investment cycle in cider is measured in decades .
"" Propagation began in 1984 .
The final selection of the 29 varieties was made in 2007 , the idea to find fruit with a perfect combination of sweetness and bitterness .
Russell said : "" It can take up to five years for new orchards to produce apples and it is typically 10 years before the grower will break even following the investment to plant a new orchard .
That was partly why the industry became so angry when the government said it was putting up duty . ""
Growing orchards is a long - term business – a stable duty regime is vital . ""
In the last 15 years , many thousands of acres of new orchards have been planted to keep pace with the increasing demand for cider , but this experiment focuses on producing new varieties .
The new apple varieties are Lizzy ; Prince William ; Amelia ; Amanda ; Jenny ; Hastings ; Connie ; Helen 's Apple ; Three Counties ; Jane ; Tina ; Early Bird ; Vicky ; Naomi ; Nicky ; Angela ; Gilly ; Willy ; Joanna ; Maggie ; Hannah ; Jean ; Sally ; Fiona ; Shamrock ; Tracey ; Eleni ; Betty and Debbie ."
2010-11-14,"As a damp grey Remembrance Sunday morning turned to rain , the Queen laid her wreath at the Cenotaph in London to lead the nation 's mourning for those who died in the first world war and in almost a century of conflicts since .
The endurance of war was brought into focus by the absence of her grandson Prince William from the ceremony .
He was with the defence secretary , Liam Fox , in Afghanistan – where he served two years ago as a Royal Air Force commander – to attend a service at Camp Bastion in Helmand province .
The war there has cost more than 340 British lives since 2001 – more than 100 in the past year .
The prime minister , David Cameron , laid the first Cenotaph wreath for the government .
But the political circumstances of the coalition government demanded a new protocol this year .
Cameron 's wreath was followed by Nick Clegg 's , as coalition partner and leader of the Liberal Democrats .
Ed Milliband , as very new leader of the opposition , was in third place .
Behind them stood three former prime ministers : Gordon Brown , apparently impervious to the rain without an overcoat , standing beside Tony Blair , and then John Major , Margaret Thatcher 's successor , looking more sprightly than either .
Two unmistakable figures familiar from the ceremony for so many years were missing : the tall , solid figure of the Rev Ian Paisley , now Lord Bannside , was absent now that he is no longer either leader of the Democratic Unionist party nor , since the May election , an MP .
Lady Thatcher was advised not to join the long cold vigil after her recent illness .
The crowds , 12-deep on the pavement , had filled Whitehall to capacity 40 minutes before the deep tones of Big Ben signalled the two - minute silence .
The ceremony ended with a procession by an estimated 7,500 former service personnel and civilians , which took 40 minutes to parade past the Cenotaph .
After the worst year for British casualties in Afghanistan since the conflict began , the British Legion has reported record sales of more than 46 m poppies .
This year 's Remembrance Sunday is particularly poignant in Coventry , falling 70 years after the devastating German bombing raid on the city that left the broken ribs of its medieval cathedral rising over acres of shattered and scorched buildings and streets .
In London yesterday , Prince Charles joined 150 members of the War Widows Association to lay a wreath at the Cenotaph before the Festival of Remembrance concert at the Royal Albert Hall .
The concert was attended by the March for Honour teams of current and former servicemen who have raised £ 1 m by marching 250 miles across Britain over the past fortnight , covering an average of 30 miles a day while carrying 18 kg ( 40lbs ) of kit .
First - hand witnesses of the first world war are nearly all gone .
Since the deaths last year of Henry Allingham and Harry Patch , Claude Choules , who now lives in Australia , is the last British born man who fought in the war .
Many second world war veterans at ceremonies today are increasingly frail .

2010-11-16,"From the moment he was born in June 1982 , Prince William Arthur Philip Louis of Wales has been at the centre of what has often seemed like a soap opera .
He has been a subject of endless tabloid fascination : how would he grow up , who would he most resemble , his father or his mother , what sort of king would he make , which career would he follow while waiting for the throne and â€ “ most often of all â€ “ who would he marry ?
In fact , the last question has been the most predictable of all .
Kate Middleton has been William 's steady girlfriend for eight years and â€ “ unlike many royal heirs
â€ “ there has scarcely been a hint of anyone else .
Despite all the mayhem that first surrounded his mother , Princess Diana , and the collapse of his parents ' marriage and her sudden death when he was only 15 , William appears to have grown up to be as sane and normal as any prince of the blood royal could hope to .
Approachable , genial and level - headed , he appears to lack the moodiness and faddishness of his father and was a hit with resolutely non - starstruck crowds in Australia on his first official visit there alone last January .
This may well have had much to do with his mother 's influence in ensuring that William and his younger brother , Harry , had as normal an upbringing as scions of the aristocracy could expect â€ “ trips to theme parks and McDonald 's , and friendships with ordinary children such as those of the royal butler Paul Burrell .
These were perhaps obvious attempts to inculcate normality , but not ones that had necessarily occurred to the royal family before .
Not that William was unused to the idea that he would one day be king
â€ “ his godparents included one former king ( Constantine of Greece ) , a princess , a knight and a clutch of baronesses .
He was taken on royal trips from babyhood â€ “ first to Australia and New Zealand with his parents at the age of one â€ “ and an early ambition to become a police officer was clearly never destined to happen .
Beside the noblesse - oblige , however , there was also immersion in Diana 's interests , such as visits to Aids clinics and homeless shelters .
Periods abroad followed , teaching children in a remote town in southern Chile as part of the Raleigh International programme .
The boys ' education followed the normal path for members of the aristocracy â€ “ but not necessarily for royalty â€ “ in that both were sent to Eton rather than Gordonstoun , the spartan Scottish school their father had hated as a child .
Instead of the remoteness of the Highlands , they were placed in a cosmopolitan milieu , easily accessible to London but also well used to dealing with the offspring of the rich and famous .
Their upbringing was clearly something of a tug of war between increasingly estranged parents , with their uncle Earl Spencer subsequently pledging the "" blood family 's "" protection of their interests in his oration at his sister 's funeral in 1997 .
One of the most poignant images to emerge from the extravagant public mourning of Diana 's death was that of William and Harry , vulnerable teenagers , walking bareheaded behind their mother 's coffin with the royal family closing ranks around them .
William achieved a degree of protection from media intrusiveness during his schooling and subsequently when he moved to St Andrews University ( armed with three A Levels â€ “ an A in geography , B in history of art and C in biology ) to study history of art in 2002 .
Initially lonely and wary of making friends , he was on the brink of giving up until being persuaded to switch his course to geography and share a student house with Kate Middleton and other friends in his second year .
Graduation with upper second class honours was followed by the obligatory military service : Sandhurst and graduation as a lieutenant in the Blues and Royals to tick the army box , serving as a troop commander in an armoured reconnaissance unit , and training with the Royal Navy and the RAF , most recently to become a search and rescue helicopter pilot based at Anglesey .
William 's most obvious outside interests have included sports : water polo , polo , rugby ( patron of the Welsh Rugby Union ) and football ( an avid Aston Villa fan , he is also the president of the Football Association ) .
He has never been the sort to fall out of nightclubs in the small hours , and once said : "" I am not a party animal , despite what some people might think . """

2010-11-16,"It was an aristocratic novelist who gave us Love in a Cold Climate .
Now the royal family are to host a Wedding in the Age of Austerity .
The delight on David Cameron 's brightly lit face as he delivered his congratulations to Prince William and Kate Middleton via the press pack outside
No 10 today was mainly that of a decent chap glad to celebrate a young couple in love .
It might have also included a shot of country set solidarity with Kate , who apparently grew up in a village just a few miles away from his own in west Berkshire and is every bit as Home Counties as he is .
But he would be forgiven if his smile were also that of a politician relieved to be the bearer – for once – of good news , having calculated that a royal wedding would act as handy distraction from the economic gloom and spending cuts that are due to bite in the early months of 2011 .
He may even see an uptick in his just - launched national happiness index .
At first , media types were trading just such cynical thoughts .
But they were soon swept aside as the 24-hour broadcasters went into full hysteria mode , the BBC dispatching a helicopter to provide an unchanging aerial shot of Buckingham Palace and pressing its most senior diplomatic and political correspondents to discuss the upcoming nuptials .
It 's easy to knock all that as an over - reaction , but the truth about Britain is that such moments – royal births , deaths and marriages – do have a habit of revealing what kind of country we are .
The joining of the girl he calls "" Babykins "" and the boy she knows as "" Big Willie "" will be no exception .
First , we got a glimpse of how others see us .
ABC 's Good Morning America opened with a trumpeted fanfare over pictures of the couple , proof that in the US Britain remains more period drama than real country , a Ruritanian theme park that is forever charming and quaint .
Here , we got a reminder that the UK media remains as fixated on the royals as ever .
The photocall and TV interview will inaugurate an unending press obsession , with Middleton 's face surely bound for the cover of Hello ! and OK !
every week from now until the wedding and for years afterwards .
The flashbulb lightning that greeted their photo - op anoints her , if only in terms of media interest , as the new Diana .
The day too showed how many British habits have endured .
Sexism lives on : the engagement was entirely reported as his , rather than their , decision .
The speculation on the dress confirmed that in matters royal , the grammar of the fairytale still applies .
Class matters too .
The BBC described Middleton without irony as a "" commoner "" , while we 're told Palace hangers - on mocked her self - made parents as vulgarly middle class ( as millionaires , they are , economically at least , way outside the middle - class mainstream ) .
Some felt a royal wedding amid recession , riots and strikes was all a bit 1981 , as if the Windsors were taking us on a Life on Mars trip back three decades .
Seeing Prince Charles still awkward and constipated in his reaction to an emotional question – irritably spitting out that he was "" obviously thrilled "" to a reporter 's inquiry , then carrying on with a meet - and - greet – suggested we had indeed taken a step back in time .
But the differences between then and now were also apparent .
Kate and William lived together as students , a fact that raised fewer eyebrows than it would have done in 1981 .
In the joint TV interview , William joked that he and his bride share a "" dirty sense of humour "" .
One ca n't have imagined Charles speaking that way and as for the Queen , well .
When the future king talked of how he and Kate used to "" hang out "" together , it was a sign that times had changed .
But there is another shift too .
Having seen the fate of three out of the four recent Windsor marriages , few will expect , as they once did , that this story will automatically have a happy ending .
But the couple did look at genuine ease with each other and have had plenty of time together , which Charles and Diana never did .
Even the most hardbitten republican will be wishing them well ."
2010-11-16,"David Cameron performed the sharpest U - turn of his premiership today , removing his former personal photographer and a filmmaker from the public payroll after intense criticism about the appointment of his so - called "" vanity staff "" to the civil service .
Downing Street acknowledged that the transfer of Andrew Parsons , Cameron 's photographer , and Nicky Woodhouse , the filmmaker behind WebCameron , to the civil service "" sent out the wrong message "" .
The prime minister 's official spokesman was later forced to defend the timing of the announcement , 20 minutes before the engagement of Prince William and Kate Middleton was revealed , after accusations that No 10 had hoped to bury a bad news story .
The decision to move Parsons and Woodhouse to the Conservative party payroll represents an embarrassment for Cameron , who strongly defended paying them from public funds during his tour of China last week .
According to a Cabinet Office source , at least one senior minister questioned the appropriateness of hiring Parsons as a civil servant but the appointment was pushed through with the support of Cameron and his director of communications , Andy Coulson .
The salaries of Parsons and Woodhouse , between £ 36,000 and £ 44,000 each , will now be paid for by the Conservative party .
They will lose their Cabinet Office desks and return to the party HQ at Millbank .
Downing Street sources said they stood by the logic of the appointments – that centrally employed media staff could cut the cost of the government 's freelance media budget – but now acknowledged the move "" sent out the wrong message "" when the rest of the public sector was being asked to make savings .
A No 10 source said : "" The PM has decided that Andrew Parsons and Nicky Woodhouse will no longer be paid for by the taxpayer .
Their jobs were across government and designed to save money ; however , he does feel it sends the wrong message .
We will continue to find ways to save money across government communications .
"" The pair were employed on short - term contracts , which allow governments to make personal appointments without advertising positions – but they are subject to civil service rules , and so must be impartial .
Labour 's Michael Dugher said he welcomed the prime minister "" bowing down to public pressure "" .
The MP , who raised the issue two weeks ago with the cabinet secretary , Gus O'Donnell , added : "" The prime minister should have known from the start that it 's wrong to bill the taxpayer for his vanity photographer .
But today 's flip - flop raises more questions .
If it 's wrong to charge taxpayers for Andrew Parsons or Nicky Woodhouse , then why are so many other Conservative party workers being hired via this sharp practice as so - called civil servants ? ""
O'Donnell last week wrote to Dugher backing the appointments and confirming that 30 staff were employed on short - term fixed contracts , the majority of whom had not previously worked for a political party .
Others include Rishi Saha , an internet expert who is close to Cameron 's inner circle and was head of digital strategy for the Conservatives , who was appointed deputy director of digital communications at the Cabinet Office .
In at least two unnamed cases the Cabinet Office conduct and ethics department was asked to vet the appointments and passed them .
The PM 's official spokesman said tonight it was "" simply not the case "" that the announcement had been timed to be overshadowed by news of the wedding .
It was made at 10.10am as Cameron was chairing a cabinet committee .
Jeremy Heywood , the prime minister 's permanent secretary , left that meeting to take the call from the palace about the engagement ."

Is it to be March or July ?
St Paul 's or Wembley stadium ?
Unimpeded by official confirmation , betting shops were quick to exploit speculation about the royal wedding today .
With news of Prince William and Kate Middleton 's nuptials splashed across the world 's front pages and saturating primetime TV in the US , Asia and Europe , anticipation of the event 's commercial potential was climbing fast .
Britain 's retail analysts , souvenir sellers and hotel owners were predicting a boost to business .
Up to Â£620 m could be injected into the UK economy , said Neil Saunders from retail researchers Verdict .

Whether those talks gave any consideration to an offer by Sir Tom Jones to perform at the wedding remained unclear .

As speculation continued about the date , a palace spokesman said that an announcement about it and the venue would be made in due course , "" after other members of the royal family , Mr and Mrs Middleton , and the government have been consulted "" .
Prince William later went back to his RAF base in Wales , where he returns to work as a helicopter search and rescue pilot this morning .
Tom Bradby , ITV 's political editor and the first journalist to interview the pair after the announcement , suggested their preferred date would be in the spring .
"" I think they want to have it in March , "" he said .
"" Their people have now got to say : ' Right , who do we invite ?
Do we invite the Obamas ?
Do we invite the Sarkozys ? '

2010-11-17,"The announcement when it came in mid - morning was , in its way , both unexpected and long - awaited .
Prince William , the second in line to the throne , now aged 28 , is to marry his longstanding girlfriend , Kate Middleton – christened Catherine and six months older than he is .
It will happen sometime next spring or summer , somewhere in London .
The rest – so far – is flim , flam and speculation .
Parents , political leaders , friends , people in the street , souvenir sellers , memorabilia manufacturers , a vineyard in Kent which is to bottle a special sparkling wine and the man who performs magic tricks for the royals are all delighted .
Posing for photographs at Clarence House last night , the prince , smiling broadly , made a better stab at expressing his feelings than his father had in 1981 when , posing for engagement photographs , he muttered , "" Whatever love is "" , in answer to questions .
William , by contrast , said : "" The timing is right .
We are very , very happy . ""
His bride - to - be expressed herself daunted .
Middleton , who has known the prince for more than eight years , since they were students at St Andrews University , will become not only the first commoner to marry a prince in close proximity to the throne since Anne Hyde was smuggled in at midnight to marry the man who became James II in 1660 , but also one of the oldest royal brides and perhaps the longest in waiting .
In due course , she may also become the sixth Queen Catherine .
The impending news from Clarence House , London home of the prince 's father , was broken first to David Cameron in the middle of a cabinet meeting before being released to the world .
William and Middleton became engaged , the statement said , in October during a private holiday in Kenya .
The blue sapphire and diamond engagement ring was Diana 's in 1981 –
"" My way of making sure my mother did n't miss out on today , "" said William .
The Queen and other close family members had been informed of the engagement .
It added : "" Prince William has also sought the permission of Miss Middleton 's father . ""
The Middletons themselves said they were thrilled .
Her father , Michael , reading a statement , said they had got to know the prince very well : "" We all think he is wonderful and we are extremely fond of him .
They make a lovely couple , they are great fun to be with , and we 've had a lot of laughs together .
We wish them every happiness for the future . ""
Within minutes the prime minister – who hails from about five miles up the road from the Middletons in West Berkshire – was proclaiming his enthusiasm , reporting that the cabinet had responded Bullingdonesquely with "" a great cheer … a great banging of tables "" .
He divulged that he himself had camped out overnight , aged 14 , to watch the wedding of Charles and Diana in 1981 .
Nick Clegg , the deputy prime minister , added his congratulations – he was "" thrilled to hear the fantastic news "" – and Ed Miliband pronounced himself delighted , adding confidently : "" The whole country will be wishing them every happiness . ""
As for the parents , stepmother Camilla , the oldest royal consort to marry a prince , exclaimed : "" It 's the most brilliant news .
It 's wicked . ""
Prince Charles , on a visit to Poundbury , his architectural experiment in Dorset , managed : "" Thrilled , obviously , thank you .
They have been practising long enough . ""
Indeed they have .
Unlike so many of his predecessors , William – a genial , approachable and level - headed young man – has not been pushed into a quick dynastic alliance with the nearest , most useful and available European princess , nor with an offspring of the aristocracy a decade younger than he is , but with the daughter of a resolutely middle - class , self - made couple .
Her forebears include Northumberland coalminers and Kent building labourers , as well as Leeds businessmen .
Her parents , Michael and Carole Middleton , met when they both worked for British Airways –
she as a flight attendant , he as a flight dispatcher – and their first married home was a flat in Slough , just across the river from the future in - laws .
They have had to bear the ill - disguised sneers of some royal hangers - on – "" Doors to manual , "" they sniggered , and was Mrs M seen chewing gum ?
– and intrusive media interest for years without assistance from the palace .
So far , they have been neither indiscreet nor loquacious .
The Middleton family fortune is based on the online company they established selling party bags and other paraphernalia for children 's parties –
Kate and her younger sister and brother were used as models in the early catalogues , and Kate has worked for the family firm again in recent years .
The success of Party Pieces not only enabled the family to move to a large house in the pretty village of Bucklebury , near Newbury , but also to educate their daughter privately , at Marlborough public school .
It was at Marlborough that Middleton Middleton first came into contact with children from the Cotswolds country set who were used to mingling with royalty and where , allegedly , she became known as princess in waiting because of her enthusiasm for the prince she had never met .
According to her school friend Jessica Hay , in an interview with the Mail on Sunday : "" We would sit around talking about all the boys at school we fancied , but Catherine would always say , ' I do n't like any of them .
They are all a bit of rough . '
Then she would joke , ' There 's no one quite like William …
I bet he 's kind .
You can tell just by looking at him . '
"" Middleton 's upbringing encompassed Brownies and games , skiing holidays and amateur dramatics .
At school she was captain of the hockey team and , if not a brilliant student , a quiet and studious one .
Hay , in another interview with the News of the World , disclosed : "" I never once saw her drunk .
Even after our GCSEs , she only drank a couple of glugs of vodka . ""
She obtained three A - levels –
As in maths and art , B in English – as William was obtaining an A in geography , B in history of art and C in biology at Eton .
Her studiousness has come in useful since she and the prince both started a history of art course and spent their first year in the same hall of residence .
William 's interest was first noticed when he paid £ 200 – not all students are impecunious – for a front - row seat at a charity fashion show in which Middleton modelled a diaphanous black lace dress over a black bandeau bra and knickers .
It was an uncharacteristically racy start ; more prosaically , she helped the lonely prince overcome a wobble at the end of his first year when he came close to quitting .
The pair shared digs in a Georgian terraced house with two other male friends in their second year , then they all moved to a less public estate cottage outside the town for their final year .
Since university , Middleton has drifted , as if waiting for her prince to come .
Her parents bought her a flat in Chelsea and she worked briefly as an assistant accessories buyer for Jigsaw , the fashion firm owned by John and Belle Robinson , who count as family friends .
She and the prince have enjoyed quiet foreign holidays , but have often been apart .
There was a blip in 2007 when they separated for a few months , allegedly because she was frustrated at his lack of commitment – virtually her only authenticated public comment until yesterday was ""
He 's so lucky to be going out with me "" – but that was soon overcome .
Asked about the breakup in a television interview last night , Middleton was more expansive . ""
At the time I was n't very happy about it , but it made me a stronger person , "" she said .
"" You find out things about yourself that maybe you had n't realised , I think you can get quite consumed by a relationship when you are younger
and I really valued that time for me [ the months apart ]
although I did n't think it at the time . ""
The bride - to - be was also posed the inevitable question about Princess Diana , and whether it was intimidating entering the royal family given William 's late mother 's status .
"" I would have loved to have met her and she 's obviously an inspirational woman to look up to , "" said the woman who is set to become Princess of Wales herself when Charles takes the throne .
"" Obviously on this day and going forward and things , you know it is a wonderful family , the members who I 've met have achieved a lot and are very inspirational and so , yes , I do , "" Middleton added , before her fiance interjected that there would be "" no pressure "" on his bride . ""
No one is trying to fill my mother 's shoes .
What she did was fantastic , "" William said .
"" It 's about making your own future and your own destiny , and Kate will do a very good job of that . ""
As the cameras flashed during an earlier appearance , Middleton also : "" It 's quite a daunting prospect
but hopefully I 'll take it in my stride , and
William 's a great teacher so hopefully he 'll be able to help me along the way .
I 'm really looking forward to spending my time with William . ""
William added : "" Obviously we both have a very fun time together , both have a very good sense of humour about things , we 're down to earth , we take the mickey out of each other a lot , and she 's got plenty of habits that make me laugh that I tease her about . ""
She said : "" You know , over the years William has looked after me , he 's treated me very well – as the loving boyfriend he is , he is very supportive of me through the good times and also through the bad times . ""
In earlier years William snorted when asked about marriage and insisted : "" I really want to be in control of my own life .
If I do n't agree with what someone is saying and pushing on me , I wo n't do it . ""
Unusually for a royal heir , intense media scrutiny has produced no unsuitable girlfriends lurking in the shrubbery .
Five years ago he said : "" I do n't want to get married until I am at least 28 or maybe 30 . ""
Next June he will be 29 ."

All that blue blood * was flowing as Harman told MPs : Can I join the prime minister in sending our warmest congratulations to Prince William and Kate Middleton on their engagement ?
No doubt her warm words show that Harman will happily fulfill her constitutional duties as a senior privy counsellor in the run - up to the wedding .
Alastair Bruce , the royal commentator , reminds us on the Sky News website that the wedding will need to be approved by the privy council : The preparations for the wedding will be progressing .
Constitutionally , it now needs to go through the proper process , according to the Royal Marriages Act , because no descendant of King George II can get married without the approval of the reigning sovereign 's permission .
Although there is no problem with this it must be done in a very formal way , through the privy council and under the Great Seal of England .
It is quite a process but that will now functionally move forward .
Perhaps Harman will make sure that a fellow Labour senior privy counsellor will turn up at the meeting to approve the royal wedding .
Peter Mandelson likes to hang round the smartest London parties so will no doubt be delighted to approve the royal wedding .
The privy council meeting will be a nice chance for Harman and Mandelson to reminisce about their memories of the wedding of Prince William 's parents in July 1981 .
Did they , like the teenage David Cameron , camp out to watch the royal procession ?
Not a bit of it .
On 29 July 1981 Harman , then aged 30 , and Mandelson , then aged 27 , boarded a cross - channel ferry for a republican awayday to France .
The group wanted to mark their opposition to the "" royalist orgy "" .
Chris McLaughlin , the editor of Tribune , told me last year : We were a happy band , we had a great deal of fun .
* OK , Harman is n't a true aristocrat .
She is the niece of an Earl but this was by marriage .
Her aunt , the late author the Countess of Longford , was married to the late 7th Earl of Longford ."
2010-11-17,"Retailers and manufacturers have wasted no time in rushing to produce commemorative ware and souvenirs such as mugs and paperweights to celebrate the forthcoming royal nuptials in what could lead to a sales bonanza not seen since the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Diana .
The marriage of Prince William and Kate Middleton is also likely to give British manufacturing industry a much - needed shot in the arm , with souvenir - makers mindful that memorabilia of the 1981 royal wedding remain sought - after , particularly by international collectors .
Leaks to tabloid newspapers last month suggested that the Royal Mint was already making preparations to begin production of a commemorative coin to celebrate this latest royal wedding , with details expected to be confirmed today .
The Royal Mail is also expected to issue souvenir stamps , including a limited edition range for collectors .
The supermarket chain Asda was quickest off the mark with the launch of a souvenir mug , which is available online today .
It features the couple 's faces framed in a heart shape â€ “ complete with the date of their engagement .
Asda said : "" Kate and Wills are the nation 's sweethearts and shoppers have said they would love to buy a piece of history while doing their shop .
Nothing says congratulations like your face on a mug . ""
A spokeswoman for the retailer said the royal wedding could prompt "" hysteria similar to when Charles and Di we d in the 1980s "" .
The Â£5 mug was designed earlier this year in anticipation of the engagement and should be on sale in stores by the end of the week .
Meanwhile , the UK 's beleaguered pottery and china manufacturing industry has been able to put plans into action after years of planning .
Stoke - on - Trent company Aynsley China said it began manufacturing a line of fine bone china pieces after yesterday 's announcement , with the first expected to arrive in stores early in the new year .
Sales director John Wallis said : "" We have had the designs prepared for some time and have been waiting for an announcement .
We 'll be making items to commemorate both the engagement and the wedding .
We find that royal weddings are always very popular with collectors all over the world . ""
Royal Crown Derby also said it had been preparing for an announcement and had designed items from small trays , a plate and a loving cup to a limited edition handpainted peacock with flowers relating to the country and special occasions .
It is waiting for a wedding date but some items are ready to be produced without one .
A range of commemorative paperweights will include designs featuring a pair of William and Kate swans , a coronet and a Welsh dragon .
Sales and marketing director Simon Willis said : "" We have been working for two or three years on designs .
Originally we worked on W and K monograms , but have â€ “ luckily â€ “ changed them since to W and C.
This is a hugely important time for us because spending has been down and we need something to make people feel they can go out and buy something to mark a special occasion . ""
Unlike some of its rivals , which have transferred manufacturing to cheaper factories abroad , all the Royal Crown Derby items will be made in the UK .
The handpainted peacock will not be cheap , retailing at about Â£3,000 , while a small tray will cost about Â£50 .
The UK 's china manufacturers are hoping for a further boost as the British Ceramic Manufacturers Association customarily invites a royal couple to choose a dinner service as a wedding present from the range made by its member companies .
When Princess Anne married Captain Mark Phillips , the pair chose a Royal Crown Derby service in the pattern "" Derby Panel Green "" , while Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson opted for a Minton design .
The now defunct chain Woolworths did not let the absence of an announcement stop it from releasing commemorative souvenirs for William and Kate in 2006 .
The chain store was so convinced of the couple 's permanence that it commissioned a range of more than 20 items including mugs , plates and a special edition mobile phone .
The couple briefly split shortly afterwards .
Once the date is announced , the industry will hope it does not change , as it did when the 2005 wedding of Charles and Camilla was postponed by one day to 9 April due to the funeral of Pope John Paul II .
The last - minute change meant souvenirs carried the wrong date , with manufacturers left no time to produce replacements .
Sharon Gater , education officer at the Wedgwood Museum in Stoke - on - Trent , said : "" New production techniques have revolutionised the manufacture of commemorative ware , and these days it is so easy to take a photograph and slap it instantly on a mug or a plate . ""
She said that in terms of collectability , there had always been "" an enduring fascination "" with any items relating to Edward VIII , before he was crowned , in 1936 .
Royal fans can be relied on to snap up mementoes of next year 's wedding , from novelty items such as tea towels , keyrings and fridge magnets as well as fine china plates and cups .
The engagement of Charles and Diana was promptly followed by an official photograph appearing on items ranging from biscuit tins to T - shirts .
Those wanting a memento of the wedding of Charles and Camilla could select a fine bone china mug featuring two entwined letter
Cs , a tea towel featuring the happy couple 's faces on a union flag background and plastic Charles and Camilla place mats .
But determining the likely longer - term value of the new range of royal wedding commemorative ware is difficult , and will be affected by how many mass - produced , low - grade items are produced .
eBay is awash with items made for Charles and Diana 's wedding in 1981 , the Queen 's Coronation in 1953 and her Silver Jubilee in 1977 , currently attracting little interest and only low bids .
Top auctioneers such as Sotheby 's , Bonhams and Christie 's say rather sniffily they do not deal with "" low value "" items such as royal commemorative ware .
Sales are instead likely to be driven through the internet , via the international market â€ “ and the US in particular .
As Crown Derby 's Simon Willis said : "" Let 's face it , Americans are fanatical about Prince William â€ “
they love him . """
2010-11-17,"I counted the pages and then recounted them .
More than 120 of today 's national newspaper pages are devoted to the royal engagement of Prince William and Kate Middleton .
It is like the 1980s all over again .
Every paper also reacted to the story in the same way .
Here was an event to lift the gloom , lift the spirits and - oh , please , please - lift sales as well .
We shall see about that .
Does the media 's royal wedding fever properly reflect the public 's view ?
Or are the TV , radio and newspaper editors indulging in self - generated frenzy that is out of step with opinion on the streets ?
Of course , the effect of wall - to - wall TV coverage and the hysteria in today 's press - except , praise be , in The Independent and The Guardian - could well stimulate an interest that , in reality , did not exist .
Look at those gushing front pages , The new romantics ( The Times ) , Sealed with Diana 's ring ( Daily Express ) , "" With mummy 's ring I thee we d "" ( The Sun ) , Kate 's very special ( Daily Telegraph ) , Proposal with a familiar ring ( Metro ) and the Daily Mirror 's rather strained pun "" With this ring ..
Di thee we d . ""
The Mail and Telegraph were leaders in the column inches league , with the former 's 29 tabloid pages competing with the latter 's 16 broadsheet pages .
( If anything , the Telegraph out - Mailed the Mail in its coverage ) .
The Sun weighed in with 21 pages and the Mirror managed 17 .
It was an orgy of print .
There was loads of frothy , cap - doffing nonsense and shameless references to the memory of the former Princess of Sales .
I like Richard Kay ,
but I was n't prepared to read his piece
headlined "" How will Charles cope with being eclipsed by William and his fashion icon bride ? ""
For the nth time , I said to myself : not again , please not again .
Not that endless attention to the clothes , the hair styles , the grooming .
The leading articles were remarkably similar in tone , from the Mail 's A royal celebration that befits our time to The Times 's The royal engagement is a moment of great private joy and a welcome renewal of the institution of monarchy .
Even the Indy , which blessedly did its best to remind us of the real world by splashing on Ireland 's economic misfortunes , saw the royal engagement as a welcome bright point in a generally austere world .
The only reference to the event on its front page was a cross - ref to Julie Burchill 's wonderfully entertaining column in which she suggested that Middleton "" is essentially marrying beneath her by throwing in her lot with the weirdest clan this side of the Addams family . ""
The Indy also featured a column by Matthew Norman , who argued that we now face months of "" mawkish drivel from determined royalists and vinegary carping from committed republicans . ""
He added : "" For those of us stuck somewhere in the indifferent middle , it 's going to be hell on earth . ""
The Guardian 's front page article by Jonathan Freedland , a man of firm republican sympathies , also forecast an unending press obsession because "" the UK media remains as fixated on the royals as ever . ""
Quite right .
David Aaronovitch in The Times warned that we should be prepared for an avalanche of lovecouple porn .
It is n't the royal family 's fault , he wrote , "" but ours . ""
Ours meaning the people or the press ?
He did n't make that clear .
The coverage was all so very predictable .
As far as I could detect from a reading of the pop papers , there was only one digression from the slavish royal fawning .
Ros Wynne - Jones , in the Mirror , confessed that she was more excited at the return of Take That than another royal wedding .
Otherwise , it was an outpouring of delight from that bunch of people we thought had vanished forever - "" royal commentators . ""
Yes , the old squad are back - James Whitaker , Robert Jobson , Penny Junor , Ingrid Seward .
They and their ilk offered us loads of speculation ( another reminder of times past ) .
When will it happen ?
They do n't know .
What will she wear ?
They do n't know .
Where will they go on honeymoon ?
They do n't know .
What title will she have ?
They do n't know .
But the not - knowing is , in the business of royal - watching , a major plus .
The absence of facts allows for endless conjecture .
Oh yes , and another feature of royal reporting is guessing right "" first "" .
So the Mail carried a rag - out of its front page headline from 2 November , A royal wedding in their sights , as if the paper had been ahead of the game .
But they were trumped by the claims of The Sun 's "" former royal editor "" , Duncan Larcombe :
William "" told me "" more than five years ago that he planned to we
d at 28 .
One final note .
It was fun to see the Indy 's little sister ,
i , breaking ranks with its big sister 's convention to treat royalty with disdain by to running a full - length front page picture .
It also had the best punning headline of the day ""
Kate says : I Will . ""
Bet The Sun , Mirror and Mail would have run that if they had thought of it ."
2010-11-18,"Biographer Andrew Morton , who with Princess Diana 's covert assistance revealed the inside story of her marriage in the explosive book Diana :
Her True Story in 1992 , is to turn his attention to her son Prince William and his fiancee Kate Middleton .
Morton is "" already at work "" on the book with a team of researchers , according to a spokesperson for his publisher Michael O'Mara Books .
Michael O'Mara himself , who heads up the company , said Morton would "" of course "" be talking to the couple 's friends , and addressing issues such as William and Kate 's previous relationships .
William and Kate is set for publication within days of the couple 's wedding next year and is described as "" both a celebration and a memento "" of the event , incorporating photographs of the couple 's big day .
But unlike his mother , William may not welcome the attention of Morton , a former tabloid journalist whose gossipy studies have delved into the personal lives of celebrity subjects including Angelina Jolie , Madonna , Monica Lewinsky and David and Victoria Beckham .
O'Mara said the book would be not just a picture book , but a full - length biography , and would take "" a rounded , balance view "" of its subjects , adding that it was "" certainly not the idea to dig up dirty gossip "" .
Morton has been "" covering William 's life since the day he was born "" , he said .
Morton said the news of the royal wedding "" has certainly brought a bit of glamour and excitement to the country , and , indeed , the whole world "" , saying that working on the book was "" a hugely exciting prospect "" .
Diana :
Her True Story was originally published in 1992 , and proved to be dynamite , revealing the unhappiness of the princess 's marriage , and Prince Charles 's long - standing attachment to Camilla Parker - Bowles .
Diana 's own involvement as the secret source for the book was not revealed until after her death in 1997 .
The book was later revised and republished as Diana :
Her True Story â€ “
In Her Own Words .
But other recipients of Morton 's biographical scrutiny have been less keen on the attention .
In 2000 the Beckhams mounted a high court action against the alleged disclosure of private details in Morton 's book on them , before coming to a settlement with the author and his publisher .
In 2005 Kenya 's high court ordered Morton to pay the country 's chief justice 6 m shillings ( Â£45,700 ) for defaming him in his 1998 book about Daniel arap
Moi , Moi :
The Making of an African Statesman .
Diana :
Her True Story has sold over 1 m copies in the UK , and many millions worldwide .
Michael O'Mara said his first print run for William and Kate : A Royal Wedding would be half a million copies in eight or nine different languages .
"" The only thing we do n't yet know is the publication date , "" he added .
"" I 'm hoping it 's June .
June is a fantastic time for a wedding and a fantastic time to publish a book . ""
Clarence House declined to comment on news that the book was planned , other than to say it was "" not a book that has been endorsed "" ."
2010-11-18,"When David Cameron used today 's PMQs to offer "" warmest congratulations "" to newly engaged Prince William and Kate Middleton there was a rumble of approval from MPs .
But most of the noise came from the Conservative benches and old hands detected less enthusiasm than in 1981 when Prince Charles and Diana Spencer announced their own engagement .
That is hardly a shock .
More surprising is that a political class that talks constantly of the need for a classless society , meritocratic and multicultural , and for constitutional reform , almost never includes the monarchy in its discussions .
In Britain at least republicanism is one of those loves that dare not speak its name .
Apart from the occasional Hattersley or Benn that silence pervades weighty Labour circles .
It is a bit like private atheism , best not to say , or to make only occasional gestures , as a few non - Tory MPs do in staying behind when the majority troops off to the Lords to hear the Queen 's speech .
Once it was just Dennis Skinner and the late Willie Hamilton , famous as Scotland 's professional monarch - baiter .
More stay behind now .
"" Not an issue for me or my constituents , "" explain most quiescent opposition MPs in 2010 .
"" We 've still got Charles and Di mugs at home . ""
And "" my wife is a good socialist , but she stayed up last night to watch the royal stuff on TV "" .
Or "" most of us are republicans in our hearts , but not our heads "" .
Solid , personal respect remains for the Queen and unheroic acknowledgement that most constituents admire her too , as well as enjoying the royal soap opera .
"" Why replace her with a second - rate politician ? "" an ex - cabinet minister asks .
Few Conservatives take their free market logic to a republic either .
"" It 's irrational , it 's illogical , but it works .
It 's one reason why I 'm a Tory , "" says a brainy Cameroon .
The monarchy , like the military , goes with the Tory grain .
Yet it was Tories who turned HMSO into the privatised Stationery Office and will flog the Royal Mail .
Plenty has happened to encourage Britain 's republicans
â€ “ 10 million citizens , according to the Republic website
â€ “ that the end is finally in sight for the 1,000-year English monarchy .
Royal divorce and misconduct has destroyed mystique and created cynicism .
Secularism and internal schism has weakened the established Church of England of which the monarch is head .
Constitutional reform has all but severed the link between the legislature and the hereditary , landed aristocracy , traditionally a crucial buttress of the throne .
But polls routinely show support for retaining the monarchy at around 70 % , lower than a generation ago , but more solid than for most embattled institutions .
Adaptability may be the key to the monarchy 's survival .
The paradox is that voters do not expect it to survive .
But nor did Edward VII ."
2010-11-18,"Proof that the whole world really was talking about Prince William 's engagement to Kate Middleton â€
“
it even had them nattering about it on The Archers .
But how on earth did they find out about it in Ambridge ?
On the internet , obviously , as Helen Archer discussed the fabulous news with her grandmother Peggy Woolley .
"" I 'm afraid I 've become rather hooked , "" said granny Woolley .
"" I even played their interview back online . ""
Now that 's what we call a double win for the BBC â€
“ doffing their cap to the royals and encouraging a bit of digital takeup at the same time .
"" It 's such lovely news that we are sure fans will like to hear it on the programme , "" said the Archers editor , Vanessa Whitburn . ""
And when the world is talking about something , Ambridge tries to as well .
"" The script was later rewritten a second time to reflect the floods in Cornwall .
But shockingly , no mention of the really big story this week â€ “ Vince Cable 's turn on Strictly ."
2010-11-18,"David Cameron held out the prospect of an extra bank holiday next year to celebrate the marriage of Prince William and Kate Middleton .
The prime minister said there would need to be a debate , but indicated he was personally keen on "" a day of national celebration "" .
Speaking to MPs today , Cameron said it would be a "" very good idea "" to have a bank holiday if the wedding is held on a weekday â€ “ but still a "" great temptation "" if it was at the weekend .
The wedding of Prince William 's parents , Charles and Diana , in 1981 was also marked by a bank holiday .
Cameron told the Commons liaison committee this afternoon : "" There is a debate I think we ought to have â€ “ obviously not knowing what the date is yet â€ “ but whether there ought to be a bank holiday .
"" I think if it 's in the middle of the week it would be a very good idea to have a bank holiday . ""
And even if it 's at the weekend â€ “ this is entirely a decision for the royal family â€
“ even if it 's at a weekend
I think there would be a great temptation to have a bank holiday , a day of national celebration to mark what is happening . ""
Liberal Democrat MP Alan Beith , the committee 's chairman , said : "" That sounds like a decision . """
2010-11-18,"So , clearly , it is a very big deal that Prince William is marrying a commoner .
The Daily Mail thinks it is a "" huge step towards rekindling the love affair between crown and country "" .
And yes , the tabloids have started calling him "" Wills "" , in that over - familiar , quasi - maternal , lickspittle nostalgia for a time when we loved them so much that a Henry would automatically be a Hal .
This nicknaming is sort of ironic ( conveying ownership , when in fact , at the very most we rent him ) , and playfully paradoxical ( seeming to be chummy , but in fact betokening our humblest respect ) , but mainly it just makes me want to be sick .
Sorry , not him , just his nickname !
He 's getting married , and I could n't be happier .
It 's a stamp of royal approval for the middle class .
Alice Thomson in The Times called it a "" Boden breakthrough "" â€ “ a beautifully crafted insult , since to the Boden classes it is excitingly bitchy , yet Middleton is slightly too young to know what it means .
Love , it means zingy polka dots
you 're too old for , in shapes frumpy enough that you just about get away with .
Let 's define our terms : royal , we all comprehend . ""
Commoner "" is anybody who holds no title of nobility , so this is probably the least snobbish word to be applied to Middleton since it does n't even spell out that she 's not an aristocrat .
She 's solidly middle class â€ “ curving upwards in her education
( she went to Marlborough ) , and downwards in her family ( her grandfather drove lorries , her mother was once an air hostess ) .
There were rumours , when they split up , that unkind friends of the prince used to call Middleton "" doors - to - manual "" , referring to her mother 's former job .
It 's funny , is n't it , snobbery ?
You think it 'll have some caustic power , then you see it in finer detail and it 's witless .
But of course , this could all be rumour .
If anybody did say anything out loud , then it would definitely be untrue , since the defining feature of establishment displeasure is that it is never spoken .
They deal with interlopers using the silent threat of a humiliation to keep their brand undiluted .
Nobody 's talking about the dilution of our brand .
Nobody 's saying , where will the middle classes go from here ?
That 's because our brand is rubbish .
There 's a fiction among the middle classes that class no longer exists .
There 's a fiction among the upper classes that it does exist , but it 's all "" separate but equal "" ; we 're essentially the same , but our funny little ways are different .
It 's all dross : the class system is intact â€
“
the people at the top think they are the best , the people at the bottom think they 're the worst .
So while everybody raises high the roof beams to love 's young dream , this wedding deals a great blow to the royal family , so great that one wonders why they 've let it happen .
I think it 's for the sake of the gene pool â€ “
they 've lived with the consequences of their open - door policy on neurotics .
It would be foolish to turn away a sane ( or , as Wills has it , "" down - to - earth "" ) one .
Social advancement is a zero sum game , though â€ “ it has to be , otherwise we 'd all have got to the top by now , we 've had centuries .
If the middle classes have won , then the aristocracy has lost .
For more than 100 years it has been thought reasonable for a posho on hard times to marry a middle class person whose family is doing well , but royals â€ ¦ royals are like penguins ; a fleck of oil the size of a penny destroys their waterproof seal and they freeze to death .
Kate Middleton might look like just a fleck , a petite size eight of arriviste , but that 'll do it .
The furnace of William 's divine right has been put out , because the rights of kings and princes no longer come from God .
They come from a different kind of faith , a dogged conviction that breeding matters .
When even the thoroughbred at the top does n't buy it , maybe the structure wo n't collapse immediately , but its internal architecture starts to look a little bit experimental ( nobody tell Prince Charles ) .
This is brilliant : this is as socially reforming as any British prince has ever been ( without abdicating ) .
And it demonstrates two great boons of the modern condition .
First , it shows the power of a young person 's sex drive to overcome all kinds of nonsense .
I 'm not speculating on the current state of William and Kate 's sex life .
They 've been together for ages .
Probably they just do it once a week , after The X Factor , like everybody else .
But in 2001 , when they met , that 's what would have driven the revolutionary zeal of the young prince ; "" never mind that one day I will be king "" ( perhaps ) "" and her family just makes hats "" ( or do they sell hats ?
Wear hats wrongly ?
Something like that â€ ¦ ) â€ “ "" is n't she pretty ! ""
Second , university was , in this as in so many other cases , the crucible of social change .
Nobody really wants to be locked into their own class .
A lot of people would give up centuries of entrenched privilege just for a bit of fresh air .
But further education is the most , possibly the only , flexible space of a person 's life .
Schools are segregated rather strictly , and by the time your education is over , your circle is made .
It just remains to be said : republicans , will you stop going on about how much this wedding will cost ?
It 's a nail in the coffin of an obnoxious hierarchy .
Are you really going to carp about lending them your hammer ?"
2010-11-18,"The impending Royal Wedding of Kate Middleton and HRH Prince William will introduce a strong Yorkshire bloodline into the Royal Family once again at the highest level .
Kate , who met William in 2001 while they were studying at Fife 's St Andrews University , was raised in the Berkshire village of Bucklebury .
Her businessman father Michael , however , was born in Leeds on June 23 1949 at Chapel Allerton Nursing Home and the Middletons have a strong Yorkshire lineage .
Her great - grandmother Olive was a member of the Lupton family , who were active for generations in Leeds in commercial and municipal work .
Francis Martineau Lupton , was one of four Lupton brothers who in the 19th century held some of the most important positions in the city .
Alderman of Leeds council Francis was an alderman of Leeds council while brothers Charles and Hugh held the office of lord mayor .
The fourth brother , Arthur , was a pro - vice chancellor of Leeds University .
Kate 's paternal grandfather Peter Francis Middleton was born in 1920 , and became a pilot instructor marrying at the Parish Church , Adel , on 7 December 1946 .
Further back in the Middleton line , her great grandfather on her paternal side was a solicitor born in Far Headingley .
He lived in Roundhay .
Both of his fathers were solicitors with strong Leeds and Wakefield connections .
Her father Michael is descended from Sir Thomas Fairfax , a Parliamentarian general in the Civil War .
The family rose to prominence as wool merchants during the 18th century .
His great - great - grandfather Frank Lupton expanded the family firm , ­William Lupton and Co , buying an old cloth mill and a finishing plant .
He and his wife Fanny , who had five children , lived in a Victorian mansion in the village of Roundhay , seven miles north of Leeds , employing six servants .
When Frank died aged 70 , on May 20 , 1884 , he left his four sons – one died in childhood – £ 64,650 in his will – the equivalent of millions today .
It was Francis 's eldest daughter ­Olive –
Michael 's grandmother – who created the union between the ­Lupton and Middleton families .
She married Noel Middleton , who came from a long line of successful and affluent Leeds solicitors , in 1914 and they had four children , Christopher , Anthony , Peter and ­Margaret .
The rich Yorkshire heritage will introduce a northern strain into the Royal Family not seen for generations at the highest levels . '
Go back a long way to find Yorkshire connections with Royalty ' While the Duchess of Kent is from Yorkshire , and the Earl of Harewood and the Lascelles family have Yorkshire links , we have to go back a long way to find any Yorkshire connections at the highest pinnacle of the Royals .
Author and historian Peter Algar , from Leeds , says : "" Even if we go back to the War of the Roses in search of a strong Yorkshire link with our monarchs , we run into difficulties .
It is a popular misconception , but the House of York were all Southerners , to a man . ""
Richard III ( when he was Duke of Gloucester ) inherited some of the Neville lands at Middleham .
He was the only one that spent any time in the north . ""
The House of Lancaster were the northerners , John of Gaunt ( descendant of Edward III ) being the ruler of the Palatine of Lancaster , which covered large parts of Yorkshire .
This was home rule for the north and not under the king 's direct jurisdiction .
"" Our true ' Yorkshire ' kings and queens date back to Viking times , other than that the links are relatively tenuous . ""
Richard III was a Northerner by adoption .
He built up his northern landholdings when he was governor of the North , swapped Chirk Castle for Skipton Castle and could rely on the support of the soldiery from York and the Ainsty .
He was popular with a lot , but not all , of the men of the county . ""
After Elizabeth I died , I believe that one of the Yorkshire - based Clifford family had a strong claim to the throne , through their marriage links to the ' Nut - Brown Maid ' , Henry VII 's cousin .
"" There are not many precendents , if any of a princess - as Kate Middleton will become - with strong Yorkshire links going on to become queen . ""
There was a Middleton family in Ilkley , West Yorkshire in Medieval times .
They took on the name Middleton , as they owned that region of Ilkley .
There is an effigy of one of the Middleton family in Ilkley Parish Church , a knight , I believe , and if I 'm not mistaken their coat of arms is displayed in the church , along with other leading families of the town . ""
The Middletons were a big land - owning family in Ilkley and my ancestors , the Bollings used to rent a large tract of land from them known as Bolling farm , which is now the site of Ilkley Town Hall . ""
Unfortunately for the Middletons , they held onto the old Catholic faith , and lost land and privileges as a consequence .
It may well be that these people are distant ancestors of Kate 's family , due to the near proximity . ""
The Lupton side of her family from Leeds had definite Ilkley connections as I have a record of them visiting the Bolling family home at Wheatley Hall in Ben Rhydding as summer boarders in the late 1700 's ( from Ilkley Ancient and Modern , by the Reverend J Horsfall Turner ) .
Maybe that 's when the Luptons first met the Middleton 's ? ""
As for the last queen with Yorkshire blood , we probably have to go back to Queen Cartimandua all those years ago , in the first century , when she was queen of the Brigantes .
For Yorkshire folk , Kate is certainly of great significance . ""
* Yorkshire 's last major royal connection with a monarch is believed to have been in 1535 when Henry , the 11th Lord Clifford converted Skipton Castle into Royal Apartments for his son 's bride .
She was Lady Eleanor Brandon .
Her mother was Mary Tudor , daughter of Henry VII , sister of Henry VIII and widow of the French king Louis XII .

For a long time I dreaded the prospect of Prince William marrying Kate Middleton .
I do n't quite know why .
Perhaps I was put off by Kate 's Sloaney way of life , her regular nightclubbing .
There was an unhappy reminder here of the fun - loving Sarah Ferguson .
I was beginning to feel that a marriage between William and Kate really would mean the end of the British monarchy .
They seemed such a pointless couple that only a truly committed monarchist would want to take up the cudgels on their behalf .
But when I tried to imagine the ideal wife for a modern king of England , I found I could n't .
Foreign princesses used to be favoured because of their royal blood ; but a foreign princess today would be a big step backwards for a royal family that has spent the last century trying to make us forget its German origins , and she would also risk becoming a hate figure for Britain 's vociferous anti - Europeans .
But a British woman of aristocratic birth would also now be a bad choice .
The Queen Mother , whose father was the Earl of Strathmore , was a great success as queen , but she married King George VI at a time when the aristocracy still commanded respect .
By the time Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer in 1981 this was no longer the case .
Diana 's personal merits and her huge popularity do not alter the fact that their marriage was a disaster and did great harm to the standing of the monarchy .
Until the Diana catastrophe it had never occurred to the royal family that any woman raised outside its orbit would be able to cope with the peculiar pressures to which royalty is exposed .
Diana had seemed ideal on paper , but as it turned out , she found her role as Princess of Wales to be stifling and intolerable .
In her nine years as Prince William 's girlfriend , Kate Middleton , on the other hand , has already shown herself to be more controlled and more discreet than Diana ever was .
I suspect that the Queen 's reported enthusiasm for the match is quite genuine , for she must already sense that Kate will cause her far less trouble than either Fergie or Diana .
I now realise how misguided the royal family has been in its insistence on good breeding as a condition for marrying into it .
We like to think that we live in a meritocracy .
The idea that the institution of the monarchy should be accessible only to people of the right heredity feels quite unacceptable today .
And thanks to Diana , the old excuse that only royals or aristocrats have the necessary equipment to handle the job of a monarch 's spouse no longer carries any conviction .
Until this week we had never heard Kate Middleton speak in public , but her performance during Tom Bradby 's ITV interview with her and William was a revelation .
She looked far more at ease than Princess Diana ever did , and she spoke with confidence and fine judgment .
Only once did she stumble , and this was when Bradby asked her if she felt "" intimidated "" at the prospect of following in the footsteps of Diana .
This made her blabber incoherently until William chipped in to say that "" no one is trying to fill my mother 's shoes "" and that Kate would carve out her own future and do so brilliantly .
I found myself believing him .
Kate 's voice was pleasant , too , neither too posh nor too affectedly proletarian , like Samantha Cameron 's .
And somehow she made William seem more decent and more agreeable than I had imagined him to be .
In short , they seemed a very nice , ordinary middle - class couple .
Both of them have been socially mobile , though in opposite directions .
Too much may be made of Kate 's descent from coalminers – we probably all have coalminers among our forebears , just as we all have aristocrats among our distant relatives – but , with her public school and university education , she seems clearly higher up the social ladder than her parents , who themselves had climbed up many rungs before her .
Meanwhile , William has been climbing down from his standing as an Eton toff to that of a helicopter pilot with a blokey manner , calling children "" kids "" and his future parents - in - law "" Mike and Carole "" .
Kate and William are both , in effect , middle class in the way that most Britons feel themselves to be , and she is glossily pretty in the way that Britons wish of their celebrities .
It now seems quite obvious that royal princes should only look for brides among the middle class .
These are the people with whom Britons in general can identify and feel comfortable with .
This does n't necessarily mean an end to the mystery and magic of the monarchy .
I expect that in due course Kate will be mythologised as much as any previous queen .
There are risks , of course , that she may fall from favour .
The wedding may seem too showy and extravagant for these straitened times .
She may look too proud or too humble , utter some offensive opinion , or put her foot in it in some other way .
But my feeling now is that she is giving the monarchy a better chance of long - term survival than it had only a week ago .
Whether or not that is a good thing is a matter of opinion , but personally I have to confess to thinking it is ."
2010-11-19,"Will the war between palace and paparazzi break out all over again ?
Now that Kate Middleton is officially engaged to Prince William , are we going to see a re - run of the battles between his mother and photographers ?
The London Evening Standard explored that possibility yesterday and , as its headline suggests - Fair game or respect : paparazzi are at odds over pursuing Kate Middleton - there was no agreement within the photographic pack .
That 's hardly a surprise .
These guys ( and some girls ) are freelance operators , individuals out for a buck , and they do not adhere to any collective pact .
But the ones who want to sell their pictures to British newspapers and magazines do appear to be aware of the need to obey the editors ' code of practice .
Or , at least , a version of it .
One of the paps quoted - Jan Almasi who works for the Eroteme agency ( which I ca n't locate online ) - spoke of photographers needing to "" respect the 100-yard rule .
"" I 'm not quite certain about that .
The editors ' code does not spell out a required distance between photographer and subject .
But the key clause ( No . 4 ) , which was formulated following the death of Princess Diana , concerns harassment .
This outlaws the pursuit of people and states that photographers must stop snapping away "" once asked to desist . ""
A sub - clause states : "" Editors must ensure these principles are observed by those working for them and take care not to use non - compliant material from other sources .
"" There is a public interest exemption , however , that does allow for editors and/or photographers to justify harassment in certain circumstances .
( They would need to be very , very good ) .
Anyway , the important point for all to grasp is that the code is applied to all - princes and commoners , celebrities and so - called ordinary members of the public - without distinction .
Though the press ( and newspaper readers ) are more likely to be interested in princes and celebrities , there is equal treatment as far as the Press Complaints Commission is concerned when considering complaints .
The PCC is also able to circulate concerns that are raised by people about paparazzi behaviour to editors , enabling them to make informed decisions about the provenance of pictures they are offered .
About 60 so - called "" desist requests "" go out each year on behalf of celebrities and members of the public .
There could be a problem with freelance journalists working for international publications , but as long as British editors refuse to buy their material , this is unlikely to be a popular sport .
What has been striking about Middleton has been her eminently sensible response to having hordes of photographers around her .
She has walked purposefully past them , refusing to be goaded into doing anything silly ( hiding behind a handbag , lashing out , screaming , pulling faces ) .
If she managed that over the years without royal protection officers then surely she will find it easier still now that she is afforded security .
She did make one formal PCC complaint , in 2007 , after the Daily Mirror published a picture of her taken in controversial circumstances .
That was resolved when the paper issued a public statement and published an immediate apology .
In March this year , she received £ 5,000 in damages for a breach of privacy , plus legal costs from picture agency Rex Features , which distributed pictures of her on a tennis court in Cornwall .
The second incident is a reminder that the developing law on privacy - which did n't exist during Princess Diana 's lifetime - could be used against intrusive photographers in future .
I noted in the Standard article that a veteran pap , Max Cisotti of Xclusive Pix , said : "" It 's all fair game . ""
If we accept the word game , it 's the adjective that counts .
The press will need to be fair ."
2010-11-20,"Prince William and Kate Middleton 's engagement this week has already sent Chinese factories whirring into production knocking out souvenirs to mark the great event .
Asda was first to pay its respects , filling its shelves with a Â£5 commemorative mug .
Souvenir tea towels , plates , spoons and key rings will inevitably follow .
Even Prince Edward 's wedding to Sophie Rhys - Jones triggered 120 lines of merchandise .
But the vast majority of it will be worthless , says Eric Knowles , ceramics expert on BBC1 's Antiques Roadshow .
"" One of the most popular items brought to us is the mug produced to celebrate the coronation of Edward VIII in 1936 .
People always think that because he abdicated , the mugs will be worth something , but in truth they were produced in huge numbers and are worth just a few pounds . ""
The only ones valued by collectors are those that had the abdication date overprinted â€ “ but , even then , Knowles says they are unlikely to fetch much more than Â£70 .
Fergus Gambon , director of British ceramics at auctioneers Bonhams , says the vast majority of royal items presented for valuation are worth next to nothing .
He says buyers really need to go back as far as Queen Victoria 's coronation before items become truly valuable .
"" If you have a mug celebrating Queen Victoria 's coronation in 1838 , these are much more collectable and can make very good money
â€ “ anywhere between Â£400 and Â£600 , depending on condition , "" Eric Knowles suggests .
Queen Elizabeth 's own wedding , to Prince Philip in 1947 , was perhaps the last time when souvenirs were not produced in such vast numbers that it made them virtually worthless .
"" If you look at memorabilia dating back to the last time Britain had a royal wedding during a period of austerity , 1947 , that tends to be worth a bit more because there was less money around and less of the material was produced .
There 's a popular Minton vase produced to celebrate the royal wedding that is quite big .
These are now worth Â£300-Â£400 . ""
But if you are looking for something that really will prompt the gasps at the end of Antiques Roadshow â€ “ the bit when the expert advises you to insure it for a five - figure sum â€ “ you have to go back 300 years .
Next week Bonhams is to auction what is probably the most valuable piece of royal memorabilia on the market .
A Meissen teapot decorated with the coat of arms of Sophie of Hanover , the mother of King George I , which dates from 1713 - 14 , is considered the earliest surviving dateable piece of Meissen porcelain , and has an estimated value of Â£200,000-Â£300,000 .
Items made for use by the royal family themselves are where the big money is .
"" There is a famous dinner service that was commissioned for use at William IV 's coronation .
Sadly it took the Rockingham factory in Yorkshire so long to produce it that by the time it was delivered , he was dead .
Plates from this service are very collectable and would fetch Â£8,000 to Â£10,000 .
Pieces made for royal consumption are to be distinguished from those made as commemoratives , where values are usually lower , although items featuring portraits of monarchs in early English Delftware can sell for many thousands , "" says Gambon .
It 's not just about ceramics , though .
In 2008 , a pair of Queen Victoria 's bloomers sold for Â£4,500 at an auction in Derby , exceeding all expectations .
The monarch 's modest cotton drawers , monogrammed with a tiny VR ( for Victoria Regina ) , attracted bids from as far afield as Brazil , Russia , Hong Kong and New York .
The regal knickers , dating from the 1890s , have a waist measuring 50 inches ( 127 cm ) .
At the same auction , a chemise with an impressive 66-inch ( 168 cm ) bust was snapped up by a collector from London for Â£3,800 , while one of Queen Victoria 's nightdresses sold for Â£5,200 to an American collector .
Judith Miller , the woman behind the renowned Miller 's Antiques Guide , says that when it comes to royal items it 's all about rarity and condition .
"" The problem with post - Victorian royal memorabilia is that was generally mass - produced , and people tend to hang on to it , so there 's still a lot of it around . ""
But she says Princess Diana still sells well , particularly in the US where demand for British royal collectables remains strong and is the main driver for prices .
The ugly and the unusual sell better than more commonly - bought items .
"" Less attractive items tend to be that bit rarer .
Take the royal divorce mug , in which Charles and Diana are looking in opposite directions .
These sell well and now they make Â£20-Â£50 â€ “ much more than their conventional rivals . ""
Miller adds that twentieth century royal items designed for Wedgwood by Eric Ravilious are also collectable .
One sold last year for close to Â£2,000 â€ “ so not everything modern is worthless .
That said , sites such as eBay are groaning under the weight of royal tat - Charles and Di spoons , Queen Mother mugs , Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson wedding dishes and so on .
Sharon Gater from the Wedgwood Museum in Stoke - on - Trent , says : "" New production techniques have revolutionised the manufacture of commemorative ware , and these days it is so easy to take a photograph and slap it instantly on a mug or a plate . ""
Scroll down the eBay listings and you will see that many of the items have starting bids of 99p and , as yet , no bids , including some memorabilia ( medals , cups and saucers ) relating to Queen Victoria 's golden and diamond jubilees in 1887 and 1897 respectively .
But if you are in the market for some royal kitsch , how about a "" Charles and Diana commemorative brick "" or a Queen 's silver jubilee Quality Street tin ( empty ) from 1977 .
In both cases the starting bid at the time of writing was 99p , with no bids so far .
Specially - issued stamps are n't much better .
A 2 1/2d red 1953 coronation stamp sells , in mint condition , for just 20p .
A set of 1981 Charles and Diana wedding stamps , with a face value of 39p , can be bought for 70p or less . ""
A full set of Queen 's coronation stamps wo n't have fared too badly .
But the stamps made for her children have been pretty hopeless in terms of cash value , "" says Paul Dauwalder of Dauwalders stamp shop in Salisbury .
But for many royal fans it 's not about the money .
Margaret Tyler 's home in Wembley , north London , is bulging with around 10,000 royal items , from paintings and plastic bags to teapots and commemorative plates .
Her vast collection is insured for Â£40,000 , though it would clearly be almost impossible to put a value on her hoard and , anyway , she says it does n't matter to her what it is worth because she has no intention of selling .
Asked about her most valuable items , she replies that you only know what a piece is worth when you come to sell it .
"" I do n't think you should really collect it to make money out of it . ""
Meanwhile , Knowles says he hopes he is sitting on the next big thing .
"" When Charles and Camilla got married , I , along with many others , was sent a piece of their wedding cake in a special tin box .
"" I ate the cake but am holding on to the tin in the expectation it could be worth something one day .
Someone told me that one appeared on an internet site at Â£300 â€ “
I have no idea whether that is true . """
2010-11-20,"Prince William took in all the fun of the fair as Blackpool 's Premier League rollercoaster ride scaled another peak .
At the end of the week in which his betrothal to Kate Middleton was announced , this was a considerably more down - at - heel engagement , but one illuminated by one of the goals of the season .
The prince 's presence at Bloomfield Road was for a friend 's stag do and Luke Varney provided something else to celebrate inside three minutes , with a vicious volley that dipped under the crossbar from 25 yards out .
Receiving a raking 80-yard pass from centre - back Ian Evatt , the on - loan
Derby forward chested the ball off the left touchline and let fly .
"" It was an absolutely audacious effort and I have not seen a better goal for a long time , "" the Blackpool manager , Ian Holloway , said .
"" Marco Van Basten tried one like that once , did n't he ?
When the ball dropped , I thought : ' Oh no , Reg [ Varney ] ...
Oh , get in . '
"" Varney turned provider a minute before the break when he beat the Wolves goalkeeper , Marcus Hahnemann , in an aerial challenge to nod down for Marlon Harewood to score .
Two goals to the good , the day was getting better for Holloway , whose afternoon began with a humbling introduction .
"" I found out before the game the prince was coming and even had the privilege of meeting him .
I told him what a cracking lady his mum was and how proud she would have been of him and Harry , "" Holloway said . ""
But I also told him to be careful where he goes when out on our town . ""
Unlike previous home encounters , however , Blackpool lacked cohesion and intensity and were therefore forced to hang on against opponents suffering the archetypal sophomore slump .
Wolves , whose vulnerability from kick - off has led to their conceding inside three minutes for three successive matches , reshaped on the half - hour .
Then twice in the second period they laid siege to Richard Kingson 's goal , but without any luck .
Substitute Nenad Milijas 's drive just after the hour was turned on to the base of the post by the fingertips of Kingson , whose best of a selection of second - half stops was a reaction save from Sylvan Ebanks - Blake .
Indecision in advanced positions emphasised why Wolves sport the top flight 's worst away record and their consolation from Kevin Doyle – his first Premier League goal of the season converted with his head four minutes from the end – proved too little , too late .
Disturbingly , this was Wolves ' ninth defeat in their past 11 games and , with only nine points to date , the portents for survival are not good .
Last season Burnley and Hull had 17 and 15 respectively at the same stage of the season and both slipped through the trapdoor .
"" We went behind to a wonder strike , but we should never have allowed him to get that opportunity , "" Mick McCarthy said .
"" Although you will never accuse a team of mine of not trying , we lacked a little bit of quality . ""
Varney provided that for a first Blackpool win over Wolves in 42 years .
THE FANS '
PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT
JOHN WOODMAN ,
AVFTT.co.uk
This was one win we really needed .
Everyone has been going on all week about how big this game was .
We have got to beat the Wigans and West Broms to stay up in this division , so this result was fantastic .
I 'd probably say that Wolves dominated the possession as they controlled the midfield .
We changed our tactics and personnel for this game .
We played four attackers and two midfielders instead of three of each .
But we were quick on the break and caught them out at the back .
Luke Varney 's goal is a contender for goal of the season .
If we get to 22 points by Christmas , we 'll stay up .

For the third game running we 've conceded the opening goal early .
Then we are always playing catch - up .
This was one of the most one - sided games I have ever seen and we still lost .
In the first half we did n't create many chances
but we saw plenty of the ball .
Then as soon as they got possession of the ball they scored .
We used to have lapses of concentration at the end of games but now they come at the start .
Foley should have done better for the first goal , and Hahnemann let us down for the second .
McCarthy tried to change things at half - time and when Ebanks - Blake came on he did make a difference .
But not much .

2010-11-21,"Euphoria is not an easy thing to measure ; in the absence of electrodes connected to the pleasure centres of their brains , you had to take our leaders at their word as they professed lingering sensations of rapture upon hearing the news that Prince William is to marry his girlfriend of the past eight years .
From his flushed complexion and shining eyes , it was , at least , easy to believe in David Cameron 's condition when he reported his and his wife 's intense pleasure at this "" fantastically important and exciting "" news .
The constitutional reformer , Nick Clegg , who described feeling "" so thrilled "" by the engagement , showed no physical signs of faking it .
Given that he is not married to the mother of his two children , Ed Miliband 's ecstasies were surely the most striking .
"" I 'm delighted for Prince William and Kate Middleton , "" he told the BBC , breaking off from paternity leave to record a passion for matrimony so obviously sincere that , at some point , he might want to give it a go .
"" They 're a lovely couple and obviously this is a national occasion , but most of all it is about a couple who are very , very much in love . ""
Not just "" very "" in love or merely "" in love "" then ?
Where the non - fraternal variety is involved , the Labour leader is plainly a connoisseur .
Each of these romantics , having advertised his own delight , was quick to declare that his feelings would naturally be shared on this "" great day for our country "" ( David Cameron ) , by a nation "" united in delight and joy "" ( Nick Clegg ) , which would certainly want to show its respects : "" The whole country will be wishing them every happiness . ""
( Ed Miliband . )
At this point , some subjects may have been asking questions such as : what is wrong with me ?
Am I normal ?
Is my anhedonic response an early sign of clinical depression or have I just watched too much reality TV ?
It was hardly a comfort that the only public figure to appear similarly unmoved , or even mildly irritated by the news , was William 's father .
When asked about his feelings , Prince Charles replied , over his shoulder : "" Thrilled , obviously .
They 've been practising long enough . ""
Like , say , the life of Kenneth Williams , the conduct of the Prince of Wales has not , generally speaking , been such as to provide the most reliable guide to conventionally appropriate behaviour .
Perhaps we have underestimated him .
Newspapers indicated that the correct response in a commoner was , rather , to devour 10 pages minimum of adulatory engagement news , plus hagiographic pull - out , with the only possible downer being William 's choice of his dead mother 's engagement ring : touching memento or a sinister token of doom from beyond the grave ; have your say .
That this was not the moment for more lingering doubts , possibly relating to public investment in the couple 's future years , that wasteland of aimless , pointless , probably witless parasitism and unemployment for which Miss Middleton has so assiduously been practising , was resoundingly confirmed by the tone of their interview with ITV 's Tom Bradby .
You gathered that our national broadcaster , the one tasked with playing the national anthem each time a royal corgi dies , could not be trusted to provide the vat of sycophancy required by the modern and unstuffy young couple .
With questions such as : "" You evidently have a very close - knit family "" and : "" It has to be said , you both look incredibly happy and relaxed "" , Bradby certainly reminded the BBC how things were done before the late Willie Hamilton indulged his chippy obsession with civil lists and the "" expensive , extravagant irrelevance "" that was Princess Margaret .
To watch Bradby at work was to believe that "" Show us you care "" , the Butler trial , Dodi Fayed , Sarah Ferguson , the Diana interview , the Camilla - Charles tapes , Sophie 's sheikh , James Hewitt , It 's a Royal Knockout and the Queen 's annus horribilis had never subsequently combined , as some thought , to threaten the existence of the monarchy , having unquestionably relieved all royals but the Queen of any dignity . ""
Of all British institutions it now appears one of the sickliest , "" David Hare wrote in 1994 , in a Charter 88 paperback called The Power and the Throne .
Tom Nairn , author of The Enchanted Glass , had already diagnosed a "" creeping republicanism of both the right and left "" .
"" The tide of history is moving against the monarch , "" agreed Andrew Morton , once notorious as the author of Diana : Her True Story .
But for some reason , around the time of New Labour , the tide of history started going out again .
Counterfactualists still speculate on events had Princess Diana not been an object of consuming erotic fascination to Alastair Campbell and his master .
As it is , Morton has now started on a book about William and Kate whose engagement , he says , "" has certainly brought a bit of glamour and excitement to the country and indeed to the whole world "" .
There : even those whose names were once synonymous with the Windsors ' feuding and degradation can be redeemed by love .
Indeed , last week 's coverage featured tributes from so many great names from the 80s and 90s as to suggest that the job of royal watcher , if not actually the key to eternal life , is certainly up there , health - wise , with the Mediterranean diet .
Unless , that is , nobody young wants to be one .
Hello again Compton Miller , Ingrid Seward , Patrick Jephson , Penny Junor , Richard Kay , Tina Brown , Hugo Vickers , Arthur Edwards and James Whitaker , the latter once nicknamed by Diana the "" big red tomato "" .
"" My biggest concern for Kate , "" the tomato writes , "" is her relatively humble background .
"" Slower to surface have been veteran republicans , reformers and feminists who used , back in the day , to denounce hereditary heads of state , primogeniture , the royal prerogative , the funding of lushery by the poor , the martyrdom of Saint Diana .
"" The monarchy might be good for tourism , but it is bad for citizenship in the late 20th century , "" wrote Jack Straw , before he was famous .
In the early 21st century , he is not the only one warming to divine right .
Last week , the primary objection to a big royal wedding , even among campaigning republicans , was its expense .
Progressive websites have ignored it .
With the public mood diagnosed as one of rapturous , incipient hysteria , perhaps they and the Labour party are right to keep quiet .
On BBC message - boards , however , snarls of "" bored already "" and "" excuse me while I throw up "" seem to tell a more nuanced story .
And is it wrong to discern , in the absence of any crowds , a degree of public apathy that might one day be more troublesome for William than all the old ghouls and republicans put together ?
In 1981 , Charles 's engagement brought a crowd of thousands to Buckingham Palace , just as there had been for his mother 's .
This time , the only outward sign of collective approval was a run on Kate 's slithery , sapphire dress , which sold out within 24 hours .
Its designer , Daniella Helayel , subsequently described herself as "" thrilled with the engagement news "" .
In her case , this is almost certainly true ."
2010-11-22,"Has there been a better piece of transfer business this year than Blackpool 's loan capture of Luke Varney ?
Tottenham 's Rafael van der Vaart would be up there but forget all the millions sloshing around at the top end of the Premier League for a minute and consider the previously unheralded Derby striker 's true worth .
His fourth top - flight goal this season – the most regal of volleys , fittingly witnessed from the executive boxes by Prince William – set up Blackpool 's first win over Wolves in 42 years .
No wonder the stag - do revellers were reaching for the bunting because when Varney scores , it 's party time at the seaside .
So far his appearances on the scoresheet have translated into 10 points for everybody 's second favourite team , astounding value from a player rescued from Pride Park stiffs .
While Varney 's stock is rising rapidly , however , fortunately for Blackpool the same can not be said of his price tag .
Fingers burnt by experiences with previous loanees DJ Campbell and Stephen Dobbie , the Bloomfield Road club 's then chairman Karl Oyston insisted on a cut - price clause in this deal .
"" We are going to sign him in January .
He ca n't go anywhere else and we get him for £ 250,000 .
They ca n't change that , there 's nothing they can do about it .
Unlucky , "" beamed the manager Ian Holloway .
Varney , relegated to League One with Sheffield Wednesday in May and uncertain of his future until the Crewe manager Dario Gradi recommended him to Holloway in August , would have to agree to a pay cut to extend his stay beyond its current kiss - me - quick status .
However , he said : "" I would be delighted if something could be done because I 've never enjoyed my football so much .
The togetherness here is nothing like I have ever seen before . ""
That bond revealed itself when , with the Wolves goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann shaking his head having been beaten inside three minutes for the third match in a row , Varney bee - lined to embrace Holloway on the bench .
His next appreciation of a colleague 's position came a minute before the interval when he nodded down for Marlon Harewood to poke in the second .
Yet Blackpool were far from their fluent best and next - to - bottom Wolves rallied luckless .
With the first - choice goalkeeper Matt Gilks hors de combat , the Ghanaian Richard Kingson excelled on his home debut to thwart half - a - dozen efforts– a touch on to the base of an upright from a Nenad Milijas 's daisycutter and an instinctive block at the near - post to deny Sylvan Ebanks - Blake equal in quality – before Kevin Doyle got off the mark for the season with a header . ""
In the last two games if we 'd had another 15 minutes we 'd have been all right , "" said Hahnemann , after a ninth defeat in 11 games .
"" It 's diabolical the way things are going , and it feels terrible to keep conceding so early on . ""
Man of the Match Luke Varney ( Blackpool )"
2010-11-23,"It will be a wonder if anyone gets any work done next April – except for wedding caterers and political canvassers , that is .
Two successive four - day weekends , bookended by bank holidays , will signal first Easter and then the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton .
No sooner had the royal wedding venue ( Westminster Abbey ) and date ( Friday 29 April ) been announced yesterday than David Cameron declared the wedding day would be a public holiday .
With Good Friday falling on 22 April , Easter Sunday on the 24th , and Easter Monday bank holiday on the 25th , the nation will scarcely have a chance to return to work before the following Friday 's wedding day flows neatly into the spring bank holiday .
The TUC immediately called for the extra bank holiday , which will extend to all of England , Wales , Northern Ireland and Scotland , to be made permanent .
To add to the nation 's unconfined joy , the Thursday after the wedding , 5 May , will be local election day – on which the proposed voting reform referendum will also be held .
Yesterday Cameron said he was content that the distraction of the wedding should lie so close to such serious political business .
"" People are perfectly capable of seeing the difference between a royal wedding , a happy day and a day of celebration , and the referendum and local election campaign , "" he said .
The choice of date – happily the feast of St Catherine of Sienna – was somewhat constrained , however , because the Queen would not have been happy attending during Lent , and because of the social calendar becoming increasingly congested with the approach of high summer .
Yesterday the prince 's private secretary , Jamie Lowther - Pinkerton , said William and Kate were "" calling the shots "" on the wedding plans , but had a "" rather large supporting cast "" to help them .
"" We know that the world will be watching on 29 April , and the couple are very , very keen indeed that the spectacle should be a classic example of what Britain does best , "" he said .
The announcement of further details of the couple 's plans was greeted cheerily by church and political leaders , but not by the Rt Rev Pete Broadbent , evangelical Anglican bishop of Willesden and a former Islington Labour councillor , who was yesterday suspended from active ministry after publicly describing the wedding as "" nauseating tosh "" ."
2010-11-23,"The wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton will take place on Friday 29 April at Westminster Abbey , Clarence House announced today .
The princes ' private secretary , Jamie Lowther - Pinkerton , said the couple had chosen the venue for its "" staggering beauty "" and that they wanted the day to be a "" classic British occasion with good spring weather "" .
He said : "" They are very much in charge of the arrangements .
I have never seen two happier people .
They 're on cloud nine , like any other newly engaged couple . ""
The royal family and the Middletons will foot the bill for the ceremony between them , though the cost of security will be met by the taxpayer .
Downing Street confirmed the day would be a bank holiday .
It will mean two long weekends in a row for many , as the previous week is the Easter break and the Monday after the wedding is the first May bank holiday . ""
The wedding of Kate and William will be a happy and momentous occasion , "" David Cameron said today .
"" We want to mark the day as one of national celebration , a public holiday will ensure the most people possible will have a chance to celebrate on the day . ""
Meanwhile it was announced today that a Church of England bishop has been indefinitely suspended after his disparaging remarks on the royal engagement .
Pete Broadbent , a suffragan in Willesden , made a series of posts on Facebook saying the marriage of Kate Middleton and Prince William would last seven years and describing the wedding day as being surrounded by "" nauseating tosh "" .
His subsequent apology failed to appease his superior , the bishop of London , the Rt Rev Richard Chartres , who said he was "" appalled "" by Broadbent 's comments .
Speaking to reporters at St James 's Palace this morning , Lowther - Pinkerton said the couple had chosen Westminster Abbey for its beauty , 1,000-year royal history and intimacy , despite its size .
He told reporters : "" The venue has long associations with the royal family - it is in many ways the royal family 's church - and , of course , with Prince William personally .
For Miss Middleton , the associations she has with the abbey are quite simply the same as any British person would have for such a glorious and holy place . ""
"" They are now getting stuck into organising their wedding .
They are very much in charge of the arrangements for the big day .
They 're giving us and the household office very firm direction indeed . ""
By coincidence , 29 April is the feast of St Catherine of Siena .
The royal family and the Middletons will pay for the service , the dress , flowers reception and honeymoon , and all the other costs families normally bear at weddings , from the royal family and Middleton 's private funds .
But one of the costs the families will not pay for is security , a senior courtier said , adding : "" It has been stressed that the only service personnel involved are those already on ceremonial duty in London .
No one will come out of training or from combat duties .
"" Additional costs are still to be talked through with government .
The service is likely to be conducted by the archbishop of Canterbury .
A senior official said the couple and the royal family were acutely aware of the national economic situation and were keen to have a ceremonial wedding that was not especially lavish .
The wedding will take place the week before the referendum on the voting system .
The congruence of those dates has been discussed with the prime minister , who has said he is content with the dates .
The official added : "" William and Kate are very keen that it should be a classic British occasion with good spring weather : in sentiment , it 's going to be that sort of day . ""
Veteran royals watchers remarked that the marriages of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh and of her parents George VI and the Queen Mother , had also been celebrated at Westminster Abbey .
Though it was also the starting place of the ill - fated unions of Princess Margaret and Antony Armstrong - Jones , the Princess Royal and Captain Mark Phillips , and the Duke of York and Sarah Ferguson .
Those of a cynical bent noted that the newly - weds would share their wedding anniversary with Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun ."
2010-11-23,"A Church of England bishop has been suspended indefinitely following his disparaging remarks about the royal wedding .
Pete Broadbent , a suffragan bishop in Willesden , wrote a series of posts on Facebook , where he said the marriage of Kate Middleton and Prince William would last seven years and described the wedding day as being surrounded by "" nauseating tosh "" .
"" We need a party in Calais for all good republicans who ca n't stand the nauseating tosh that surrounds this event , "" he wrote .
His comments incurred the anger of politicians and fellow clergy , with the outcry forcing him to apologise for his language , which he described as "" deeply offensive "" .
But his apology failed to appease his superior , the bishop of London , the Right Rev Richard Chartres , who said he was "" appalled "" by Broadbent 's comments .
In a statement today he said : "" In common with most of the country I share the joy which the news of the engagement has brought .
"" I have now had an opportunity to discuss with Bishop Peter how his comments came to be made and I have noted his unreserved apology .
Nevertheless , I have asked him to withdraw from public ministry until further notice .
"" I have been in touch with St James ' Palace to express my own dismay on behalf of the church . ""
Broadbent was absent from this morning 's service at Westminster Abbey , marking the inauguration of the Church of England 's General Synod ."
2010-11-23,"It has been nearly 30 years since the last big royal wedding , so the announcement that Prince William is to marry his long - standing sweetheart Kate Middleton was Big News .
She will not only be his wife and his princess , but in the not so distant future she will be his queen .
Alongside all the usual guff about frocks and fol - de - rols , there has been some earnest discussion about morganatic marriage , for the future consort is a commoner .
When the royal father - in - law - to - be , Prince Charles , married Diana Spencer in 1981 , blue blood was considered essential in future queens .
Now it has become irrelevant .
That is not to say that we are at last reaching the nirvana of classlessness .
The coming wedding will almost certainly be muted by previous standards , given that even royals must accept that we live in austere times .
But for all that it will be a glittering affair , with gorgeous clothes and uniforms , carriages , cheering crowds and , as they used to say in the north , several kinds of cake .
Given the disastrous marital record of the royal family , there has been some speculation about how long the latest romance will last .
That seems distasteful as well as baseless .
The future king is to have a stunningly beautiful wife and they deserve joy of each other .
NHS is good for you Diehard lefties who can not take pleasure in the royal nuptials may instead turn for comfort to the latest survey by the US health thinktank the Commonwealth Fund .
It has found that Britain is the only one of 11 leading industrialised nations in which wealth does not determine the provision of high - quality healthcare .
The report 's starkest finding is that one - third of American adults "" went without recommended care , did not see a doctor when sick or failed to fill prescriptions because of costs "" .
The corresponding figure for the UK was 6 % .
What is more , the National Health Service ( NHS ) was found to be extremely cost - effective , with spending on health per person almost the lowest of any country surveyed .
None of this has much impressed government ministers , who are hell - bent on "" reforms "" to make the NHS more efficient .
This is a none - too - cryptic way of saying that they want it to spend less .
The grey - haired gang
We no longer much use the phrase "" lager louts "" to describe yobs and rowdies .
But now we have a new label for another section of the misbehaving public :
Saga louts , or pensioners who end up getting arrested and locked up .
The grey crimewave , as it is called , is increasing .
Statistics compiled by various police forces show that the number of pensioners being arrested is up by between 15 % and 25 % .
In Derbyshire , for instance , 260 over-65s were arrested for serious crimes in 2009 , compared with 88 the previous year .
In Scotland the number of over-65s charged with drug and weapons crimes has more than doubled in four years .
Experts are puzzled by the trend .
Some believe that elderly people on low pensions are turning to crime through necessity .
Others think the figures reflect an increasingly tough attitude in the courts .
Either way , the elderly are beginning to have an impact on the justice system and even on the prison service .
Kingston jail in Portsmouth has become the first in the country to have a special wing for the older criminal , with stairlifts and other aids .
Kind to Kinder Scout Kinder Scout is one of the most evocative place - names in England .
Almost 80 years ago , campaigners for the so - called right to roam gathered on the windswept plateau in the Derbyshire Pennines in defiance of local gamekeepers and police .
There were bloody skirmishes before the demonstration was broken up , but the mass trespass set in train the events that led to the creation of national parks – including the one that embraces Kinder Scout – and a much greater freedom for ramblers to enjoy the countryside .
But now Kinder Scout is in trouble .
Barely controlled sheep grazing and tens of thousands of walking enthusiasts , combined with air pollution from the surrounding cities and occasional catastrophic underground peat fires , have eroded the fragile surface of the bleak but beautiful Pennine moors .
Now the National Trust , which owns most of the plateau , has come up with a bold plan to put up sheep - proof fences , with access points for walkers , to encourage the regeneration of vital plants like cottongrass , heather and bilberry .
Kinder still to animals We are daily bombarded with food scares – salt kills , butter maims , fast food will wipe out civilisation ; that kind of thing – but not many of us take the doomsaying seriously .
A new EU - wide survey has found that concerns in the UK about pesticides , pollution , bird flu , mad cow disease , genetic modification , food additives and salmonella have all fallen significantly in the last five years .
But , true to British form , our concern for animal welfare is increasing .
More than two - thirds of Britons are worried about conditions for farm animals .
Awareness of the issue is thought to have been raised by high - profile campaigns by celebrity chefs , and by proposals for a super - dairy in Lincolnshire .
Slowly , it seems , we are becoming aware of the dominance of factory - farming and industrial food processing .
Still , though we might feel sorry for penned - in pigs and cooped - up chickens , we show no loss of appetite for shoving fast , packaged food down our necks .
Stonehenge revamp
In a troubled and austere world , it is good to report that the long - awaited new visitor centre at Stonehenge is looking much closer to reality .
No thanks to the government , of course , but because of a £ 10 m ( $ 16 m ) grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund .
There is now hope that the £ 27 m replacement for the existing drab , tatty facilities will be ready by 2012 , when the London Olympics are expected to bring a flood of tourists to Britain .
The Heritage Lottery Fund is also forking out £ 2 m for a comprehensive refurbishment of Charles Dickens 's only surviving London home , in Clerkenwell .
It , too , should be ready for 2012 .
A third beneficiary of non - government funds is the Royal Opera House , which is about to open a spanking new production workshop by the side of the Thames in Purfleet , Essex .
The bulk of the cost was met by Arts Council England .
The bouncing bill
It seemed a very ordinary slice of London life : a young , well - dressed couple enjoying an excellent dinner at the posh L'Autre Pied restaurant in Marylebone .
Each had three courses , with two bottles of champagne between them .
When , after the main course , they said they were going outside for a smoke , staff thought nothing of it , and even helped them on with their coats .
That was the last they saw of the smart young couple , who vanished into the night without paying .
A petty crime , you might think , except that there is very little petty about an unpaid bill of £ 572.74 .
What is even more astonishing is the reaction of the restaurant manager , Leonara Papaj : "" They looked like a very genuine , very lovely couple .
Their bill was an average spend .
Nothing was out of place or unusual . ""
So , next time you have a sausage roll for lunch , think of yourself as quite extraordinary .
Dairy was corrected for "" diary "" on 10 December ."
2010-11-24,"In one of the least unexpected announcements so far about next year 's royal wedding , it was revealed yesterday that Prince William will marry his fiancee Kate Middleton on Friday 29 April at Westminster Abbey .
Disclosing the news to journalists , Jamie Lowther - Pinkerton , the prince 's private secretary , took trouble to emphasise that , like most parents and in - laws , the royal family and the bride 's parents , Michael and Carole Middleton , wealthy in their own right , will meet the bulk of the costs , including those of the service , flowers , bride 's dress , catering and reception , and honeymoon .
Lowther - Pinkerton , normally a stern - faced former SAS officer , said with aplomb : "" The couple are completely over the moon .
I have never seen two happier people .
They are on cloud nine . ""
The two were said to be getting fully stuck into the arrangements , and imposing their views on staff in emails and calls from the couple 's cottage at RAF Valley on Anglesey , where William is working as a helicopter air sea rescue pilot .
The taxpayer will be expected to meet the cost of security and any service personnel on duty for the ceremonial , although officials said that any troops mustered would be drawn from those , such as the Household Cavalry , already assigned to ceremonial duties in London and would not be withdrawn from active service .
What were described as "" associated and consequential costs "" , such as those for ceremonials , have still to be talked through with the government .
Lowther - Pinkerton said : "" All parties involved in the wedding , not least Prince William and Miss Middleton , want to ensure that a balance is struck between enjoying the day and the current economic situation â€ ¦
The couple are mindful of the situation , and Prince William has already expressed a clear wish that any involvement by the armed forces should rely in great part on those servicemen and women already committed to public and ceremonial duties . ""
The wedding will be what was termed a "" semi - state "" occasion .
It is not yet known which if any members of foreign royal families may be invited .
Lowther - Pinkerton added : "" We know the world will be watching on 29 April , and they are very keen it should be a classic British occasion â€ ¦ a classic example of what Britain does best .
Prince William and Catherine made it very clear they wish everybody to be able to enjoy it with them , consequently it will be a proper celebration for the nation and the realm . ""
That means probably open carriages and a uniformed cavalry escort .
It is likely , though not yet fixed , the service will be conducted by Rowan Williams , Archbishop of Canterbury .
The date is the feast day of St Catherine of Sienna , though this was said to be incidental .
Westminster Abbey was chosen for its long associations with the royal family , "" a feeling almost of a parish church "" , said the private secretary .
News of the date would have come as a surprise , welcome or otherwise , to many couples who had already decided on the same day .
Claire Webber , 30 and Jaimi Mitchell , 37 , had set Friday 29 April 2011 as their special day soon after becoming engaged in March .
Yesterday they were astonished the royal couple had chosen the very same day .
"" I was really surprised , "" said Webber , 30 .
"" It 's still sinking in .
It 's strange , but I think it 's really nice
and it 's going to be very memorable .
"" You can only look at it in a positive way .
It 's a date everyone is going to remember , and people will be thinking about weddings anyway .
And because it 's now going to be a bank holiday , our guests wo n't have to take the day off . ""
Mitchell and Webber have chosen Parklands Quendon Hall , a 17th century mansion set in a deer park in Essex , for their ceremony and reception , and are inviting 85 guests .
The two have already paid for most of the wedding , including the bride - to - be 's dress and dresses for three bridesmaids and two flower girls , "" mainly because of the VAT
[ rise in January ] "" , Webber said .
The couple work in insurance , met at their loss adjuster in the City five years ago , and got together a year later ; he proposed on a boat trip in New Zealand .
She said she would , like many others , be keen to watch the royal wedding and will have the television on while getting ready for her big day .
"" We 're not getting married until the early afternoon , so if they get married in the morning I 'm sure everyone will watch .
I know I will . """

2010-11-25,"Responding to the news of the engagement of Prince William and his Kate , Camilla ( Duchess of Cornwall ) responded with delight : "" It 's wicked ! ""
she said .
Curiously – Jungians say synchronistically – I was at the same time as hearing this happy news , reading Anne Tyler 's The Tin Can Tree , which quotes a review by John Updike , opining that she is "" wickedly "" good .
I like being surrounded by all this wickedness , it reminds me of when my kids were younger , and "" wicked "" was their favourite term of approbation , meaning what my generation meant by "" cool ! ""
In fact the term rather infiltrated my vocabulary –
I dodged "" awesome ! ""
–
and I still use it occasionally , though it makes me slightly embarrassed , listening to myself .
Presumably inversion in the meaning of "" wicked "" ironically captures the delights that sinfulness can encompass .
It may be wicked to eat too much ice cream , or to seduce the farmer 's son or daughter , because it is so tempting , so delightful .
In this sense , wicked means dangerously pleasurable .
At the same time that this was happening – wait for it : how spooky is this ?
–
I was offered a rare book which , while well out of field for me , was extremely enticing .
It is a Bible , published in 1631 by Barker and Lucas , the royal printers , with one of the most famous misprints ( if it is that ) in the whole of literature .
In its citation of the Ten Commandments ( Exodus 20:14 ) we have as Number Seven : "" THOU SHALT COMMIT ADULTERY . ""
Given the number of the faithful who believe in a literal interpretation of the holy word , this new injunction was likely to cause the odd misunderstanding .
( "" I am not repentant , my dear , I am merely obeying God 's will . "" )
Though the mistake is frequently referred to as a compositor 's error , it appears unlikely to have been simply an oversight ; there seems something purposive about it .
Whether this was due to some radical naughtiness , or had a vengeful aspect , it would have to have been the work of some youthful and itinerant printer , who could set the offending type , and hightail it out of town .
( Do I feel a short story coming on ? ) .
King Charles I , apprised of the error by the Bishop of London , summoned the frightened and mortified printers to the Star Chamber , revoked their licence , and fined them £ 300 – some £ 35,000 in today 's money .
The Archbishop of Canterbury was scandalised and , in those Puritan times , unwilling or unable to conceive of the mistake as a hoax .
He blamed the whole sad affair on shoddy standards in the industry : "" I knew the tyme when great care was had about printing , the Bibles especially , good compositors and the best correctors were gotten being grave and learned men , the paper and the letter rare , and faire every way of the beste , but now the paper is nought , the composers boyes , and the correctors unlearned .
"" The book soon became known as The Wicked Bible .
All stocks ( a thousand were printed ) were destroyed , and sold copies that could be traced were recalled .
But months had passed since the Bible was first offered for sale , and the figure of "" eleven "" surviving copies cited on Wickedpedia is certainly too low .
What is clear is that , as assiduously as contemporary copies were hunted down for destruction , copies are now sought enthusiastically for preservation .
What my book 's owner wanted to know , of course , was how much it might be worth ?
He was greatly encouraged by an online reference to an antiquarian firm called Greatsite.com ( "" World 's Largest Dealer of Rare and Antique Bibles "" ) offering a copy of the book for $ 89,500 ( £ 55,000 ) .
Their description of the item is breathlessly excited : "" an unspeakably rare collector 's item ... only a handful escaped destruction , making them the rarest of the rare .
This is the only one for sale in the world . ""
When I emailed them , one John Lawton Jeffcoat III , who sounds more like an evangelist than a dealer , told me that their book had sold , and immediately been replaced by "" an even better , totally original "" copy , priced at $ 99,500 .
The rarest of the rare ?
How does one value such a book , given the ( relative ) scarcity of copies ?
A dealer 's first resource is the database of auction records , which locates five copies sold at auction since 1979 .
But such data is notoriously difficult to interpret , especially when you ca n't actually examine the individual copies .
The key criteria are these : is the copy complete ?
Is it in a binding of the period ?
Were the pages trimmed before binding ?
What else might it be bound with ( it was common to bind religious material such as Books of Common Prayer together with Bibles ) ?
Is it in good condition ?
Depending on the answers to these questions , the auctioned copies fell within a range of value from as low as $ 240 in 1979 ( another in 1991 at $ 380 ) – both in poor condition and lacking some pages – to a top price of $ 27,000 in 1996 , in a contemporary binding but lacking some of the ancillary genealogies and the map .
Well , that is some 15 years since the last copy at auction , and you can see where the Greatsite.com dealers are coming from .
But their price is high - end retail , and my collector 's copy , if in similar condition , is only likely to be worth , say , half that .
Unless , of course , you can locate a private buyer , and sell it to them more expensively .
Perhaps someone might wish to give it as a ... ?
No , too cruel .
Not a royal wedding present , though Prince William 's parents obeyed the commandment of the Wicked Bible faithfully enough .
The Prince of Wales is after all , our future king , and defender of the faith of the Church of England ( or as he revised the phrase , "" defender of faith "" ) and would not be amused .
He surely would n't wish to encourage wicked behaviour , whatever his Camilla might have meant ."
2010-11-26,"BBC coverage of Prince William 's marriage to Kate Middleton will not fall victim to funding cuts required by the freezing of the annual licence fee at Â£145.50 , according to a senior corporation executive .
Jana Bennett , BBC Vision director , warned of "" potential delays "" to planned series or events because of budget cuts , but said the royal wedding on 29 April will be given "" due prominence ... this will be a big - scale event "" .
She said that BBC1 will carry the main responsibility of bringing "" everybody together "" for the Westminster Abbey ceremony and accompanying celebrations .
But she added that other BBC channels could also play a part , looking at details such as the wedding dress .
"" I could see BBC3 doing something like that though they 've already got Do n't Tell the Bride , "" she said .
A meeting of broadcasters about covering the event will take place next week and Bennett predicted the wedding could boost the sales of high - definition TV sets in the same way the Queen 's coronations enticed people to buy their first television in 1953 .
Bennett admitted BBC TV series and events planned for 2012 onwards could be delayed as a result of the licence fee freeze .
She said the corporation will protect the "" scale "" of its London 2012 Olympics coverage but other major TV events are likely to suffer .
The BBC is facing a 16 % funding cut in real terms over six years from next April , as the licence fee is frozen at the annual current level of Â£145.50 , following the hastily negotiated and controversial deal with the government .
The licence fee brings in Â£3.6bn a year for the BBC .
The new settlement was announced by the chancellor , George Osborne , on 20 October as part of the government 's comprehensive spending review .
The BBC Trust announced in September that it would sacrifice an agreed 2 % licence fee rise and freeze it at Â£145.50 for the financial year from 1 April .
Budgets for BBC TV channels for the year from 1 April will be set by around next February and will take into account the reduction in funding , Bennett said .
She added that the BBC is looking at its finances across the board due to the impending funding cuts .
Speaking at a Broadcasting Press Guild lunch in London yesterday , Bennett said the freeze amounted to a loss of around Â£144 m , and comes on top of the deficit created by the projected Â£1.5bn pension black hole .
She added that the BBC is aiming for a "" zero balance sheet "" by the end off its charter period in 2017 , and executives are looking to see how this could be achieved .
More money could come from BBC Worldwide as it has had a good year and is looking to sell off a stake in its magazines business .
"" There 's a question of how much they are going to contribute , "" Bennett said .
But she was coy on speculation that she might be joining BBC Worldwide , saying "" people talk to me from time to time about jobs .
There 's absolutely nothing I can tell you now . ""
She also denied she has come under political pressure over Panorama 's forthcoming investigation into bids for the World Cup in 2018 .
Bennett said The One Show is "" in very good health "" in spite of presenter Jason Manford 's high - profile and sudden resignation , but no replacement is imminent .
"" People will be interested [ in applying ] because it 's a great show , "" she added .
She said that despite Manford departing under a cloud after tweeting explicit messages : "" Tweeting is n't banned .
The problem is it feels private
but it 's public .

2010-11-29,"The vision of a prime minister , a future king and England 's most recognised footballer prostrating themselves before Fifa 's pseudo - papal state was never going to be edifying .
days before the 2018 World Cup vote , the English bid is starting to feel like complicity in the supreme authority 's slavering pursuit of the game 's astronomical wealth , both over and underneath the counter .
Guilt by association is not a charge David Cameron , Prince William or David Beckham would answer to .
They would say the prize exceeds any compromise they might have to make by playing politics in Zurich .
But the reality is that all those on the catwalk in this parade are going along with the world governing body 's refusal to reform .
To see world leaders confer respectability on such a dubious private club is unendingly worrying .
The allegations of influence - peddling outlined by Panorama , which follow a Sunday Times exposé into alleged vote - selling by Fifa executive committee members , have rendered Thursday 's vote hollow , except that a verdict will be delivered anyway , and two bidders will fly away from the lakes counting the gains from being awarded the 2018 and 2022 tournaments .
Sepp Blatter 's dysfunctional "" football family "" will be left with a choice : become a transparent international parliament for the world 's favourite game or continue to provide a means for opportunists to sell power to would - be tournament hosts and private companies .
The modern Fifa is what happens when an administrative body mutates into a rampantly commercial animal .
No longer mere custodians of the game , they become deal - makers inflating the price of television contracts and fostering a what - have - you - done - for - me - lately culture .
Countries hoping to earn the ultimate honour of staging sport 's biggest event after the Olympics are encouraged to engage in a beauty contest which is so constructed to allow favours to be swapped , inducements to be laid out and – if the Sunday Times was correct – individual executive committee members to profit at the ballot box .
Do n't let them vote , it only encourages them .
Only a minor tweak of the old anarchist slogan is required to capture the feelings of many as the Zurich cabaret opens .
In a more idealistic world the 2018 and 2022 votes would be postponed indefinitely , or all the bidders would assert their displeasure by withdrawing their applications , leaving the lawns of Fifa HQ as the only viable venue until corruption is faced .
Temptation exists partly because Fifa is less busy than Uefa , the European equivalent , or the national associations who kneel at Blatter 's throne .
Fifa has fewer tournaments to organise and so less to bestow .
When the chance comes round , World Cup staging is instantly ensnared with inter - confederation politics and the ambitions of less wealthy countries hunting a greater share of the booty .
Many times the thought has arisen : are horsetrading and acquiescence a price worth paying for an event England have not won since 1966 ?
Here , international football is an afterthought to the global proselytising of the Premier League .
The mother country would have a hard time refuting the charge that the English just do n't take the international game seriously , however giddy St George turns every couple of years .
The stock defence will be that Panorama 's allegations are "" old "" .
Much was already known about Fifa 's relationship with the now defunct marketing firm International Sports and Leisure ( ISL ) from past revelations and a Swiss court case .
The payouts by ISL at the time were not a criminal offence in Switzerland but the alleged scale ( $ 100 m ) highlighted by Andrew Jennings and the BBC is undeniably shocking , even if Panorama succumbed to the usual silly cult of the presenter .
Among those accused are the heads of African , Brazilian and South American football ( Issa Hayatou , Ricardo Teixeira and Nicolás Léoz ) .
Jack Warner , a major powerbroker and intended lunch partner for Cameron , has been wooed nonstop by England 's bid leaders .
Fabio Capello 's team were even shipped out to Trinidad and Tobago for a game partly to please Warner , the Concacaf president , who faces fresh accusations that he "" used his position to try to help touts obtain tickets for the 2010 World Cup "" .
These allegations are being pinned not to minor functionaries but senior members of the politburo .
The long reach of the Panorama material – 10 years and more – increases rather than diminishes its seriousness .
It says long - term survival is possible at Fifa even after malpractice has been exposed .
Casual observers will see the same old faces presenting themselves for another chance to play God .
The four named by Panorama are in addition to the Exco members accused in the Sunday Times investigation , which means six of the 23 who were scheduled to vote on Thursday – two of whom have been suspended and will not take part – are the subject of suspicion .
In its urge to bring a World Cup final to Wembley for the first time in 52 years , the English bid called Panorama 's timing "" unpatriotic "" and talked of "" our friends "" on the committee .
Realpolitik , they would call it .
Desperation , others would say ."
2010-11-29,"England 's 2018 World Cup bid team will today launch a PR and lobbying offensive aimed at neutralising the effect of tonight 's BBC Panorama documentary on Fifa voters , amid fears that rivals could conspire to try to knock them out in the first round of voting .
Key members of the 2018 team arrived in Zurich last night before Thursday 's vote , with the prime minister , David Cameron , Prince William and David Beckham among a delegation of 30 due to join them .
They will today launch a film featuring Beckham , Steven Gerrard , Rio Ferdinand , Asamoah Gyan , Michael Essien and others aimed at emphasising the positives for football around the world if England should beat the bids from Russia and Spain / Portugal to host the 2018 tournament .
It will combine film of coaching sessions in the Caribbean , Asia and Africa with footage of overseas stars – including players such as Nani and Fernando Torres – playing in the Premier League .
England has promised to match Fifa 's existing investment in grass - roots football around the world , export Beckham 's coaching academy globally and reach one billion people through its "" Football United "" fund if it wins . ""
English football would aim to harness the country 's commercial and broadcast strength , its record of supporting good causes and its enthusiasm for and experience of major large scale fundraising initiatives .
Much of this is brought to life by the people involved in our film , "" said the 2018 chief executive , Andy Anson .
It is hoped that the push to emphasise the benefits for football globally will help neutralise the perceived negative effect of tonight 's Panorama on Fifa corruption , which will be broadcast as planned despite representations to the BBC .
The culture secretary , Jeremy Hunt , who is also travelling with the official delegation , admitted yesterday that England went into the vote as underdogs but drew an analogy with Tottenham Hotspur 's recent comeback against Arsenal as evidence they could win .
"" We are going into this week very upbeat .
I really think we can win this , "" he said .
Rumours have continued to circulate among those close to the bidding process that England 's rivals could persuade a handful of their supporters to vote for Holland and Belgium 's joint bid in order to eliminate them in the first round .
Spain / Portugal 's bid has expressed confidence that it has secured around eight of the 22 votes on offer in the first round .
The lowest - scoring bid will be knocked out in each round until a majority verdict is reached .
If England is to progress , the support of the three votes controlled by the Concacaf president , Jack Warner , is seen as crucial .
The controversial Warner has been vitriolic in his criticism of the BBC for pressing ahead with the Panorama film .
Hunt , who travelled to Kuala Lumpur with Anson last week as part of a final lobbying push , said yesterday he had been assured by Fifa executive committee members that it would have no impact on their deliberations .
He said he had spoken to almost half of the 22 voters .
"" I hope that is the case .
All the Fifa delegates I have spoken to have assured me that is the case , "" Hunt told the BBC . ""
In technical terms we have the best football infrastructure of any country anywhere in the world , commercially we have the biggest and best Premiership in the world .
"" There are more fans globally for Premiership teams than for any other country in the world .
That is why the 2018 World Cup would have a bigger reach than one hosted anywhere else .
That is the message we are trying to get across .
"" We want to win this because we genuinely , passionately believe we can offer the most to the game worldwide . """
2010-11-29,"Three of the Fifa executive committee members who will decide the fate of the 2018 World Cup were tonight accused of taking bribes in a corruption scandal involving around $ 100 m ( £ 64.2 m ) of secret payments .
The BBC 's Panorama documentary , the timing of which had been branded "" unpatriotic "" by bid executives before broadcast and "" frustrating "" by the prime minister , David Cameron , also contained fresh allegations against the Concacaf president , Jack Warner , concerning a ticketing scandal linked to the 2010 World Cup .
Warner and the three votes he controls are seen as key to England 's hopes of progressing beyond the first round and Prince William , David Beckham and Cameron – the bid 's "" three lions "" , as the chief executive , Andy Anson , called them – will be called upon to try to limit the damage .
Cameron will arrive in Zurich tomorrow and is expected to meet Warner , who has been scathing in his criticism of the BBC documentary .
Critics of the timing of the programme tonight insisted that the strength and topicality of the new allegations did not justify broadcasting it three days before the vote – particularly as the claims had nothing to do with the bidding process .
England 2018 also condemned the programme , calling it "" an embarrassment "" to the BBC .
They said in a statement : "" We stand by our previous position that the BBC 's Panorama did nothing more than rake over a series of historical allegations none of which are relevant to the current bidding process .
It should be seen as an embarrassment to the BBC . ""
Warner , embroiled in an earlier ticketing scandal at the 2006 World Cup , was tonight alleged to have ordered tickets costing $ 84,240 from the Fifa ticket office for the 2010 tournament , only for the deal to fall through .
On the back of the Sunday Times investigation that led to the suspension of six Fifa officials but created a climate of suspicion among the electorate , the Panorama allegations are likely to lead to further hostility against the British media .
The claims will lead to renewed calls for Fifa to answer outstanding questions over the International Sports and Leisure ( ISL ) affair , which triggered one of Switzerland 's biggest criminal fraud cases , and justify the continued presence of the individuals concerned on its executive committee .
One of the three , Cameroon 's Issa Hayatou , who has never been named before in connection with the affair , appears on a detailed list of 175 alleged secret payments , made betweeen 1989 and 1999 , from the defunct sports marketing company ISL , routed via a series of front companies in Liechtenstein to top Fifa officials .
Hayatou , once seen as a key target for England , was understood to have reacted furiously to the earlier Sunday Times investigation and the three‑year suspension handed down to Adamu and will be further angered by the latest allegations .
The Paraguayan head of the South American football federation , Nicolás Léoz , also on the list , was named in connection with two ISL payments totalling $ 130,000 during court proceedings in 2008 but Panorama alleged that he received three further payments of $ 200,000 each .
He was lobbied only last week by the England bid team .
The payments list shows that a Liechtenstein company , Sanud , received $ 9.5 m .
Ricardo Teixeira , head of the Brazilian Football Confederation , the third executive member named , was linked to Sanud by a 2001 Brazilian Senate investigation which found it had secretly channelled money to him .
Six ISL managers were tried in 2008 for misusing company money , but they were not tried for commercial bribery as it was not an offence in Switzerland until 2001 .
The Fifa president , Sepp Blatter , already under fire over the opaque bidding process , declined to comment on the three Fifa executives alleged to have taken bribes .
ISL was declared bankrupt in May 2001 but the fallout continued until last June , when the second of two Swiss court cases ended with an agreement to pay £ 3.5 m to settle the case anonymously .
At the time Fifa said : "" It is important to recall that the decision was made on matters which took place prior to the year 2000 and that there has been no court conviction against Fifa .
In addition , the Fifa president has been cleared of any wrongdoing in this matter . ""
Fifa refused to comment tonight .
BBC insiders said that there was a strong public interest rationale in showing the film before the vote took place and that they had been editing it right up until the last minute , having acquired the key document only in recent weeks .
Anson insisted that although England were "" underdogs "" he was confident that there was a credible "" path to victory "" as the last‑minute lobbying intensified .
He reiterated his concerns about Panorama . ""
Of course I 'm disappointed with the timing and it 's certainly not going to win any votes , "" said Anson , who said he would not be watching the programme .
"" It 's a reality , it 's a small group of 23 people ; in a way it 's a brotherhood of executive committee members .
If you hurt one of them , of course it has an impact on the others .
That 's just inevitable .
I do n't think that we are going to be derailed by it , we just have to be aware of the implications and act accordingly .
But we 'd be naïve if we though it would not have an impact.""Last night , the watchdog body Transparency International called on Fifa to postpone Thursday 's vote after the claims had "" cast such discredit on FIFA 's processes that a decision under these circumstances would only fan the controversy . ""
However , the Uefa president Michel Platini , one of the 23 voters , insisted last night : "" I do n't think it will have any effect on the voting , people took their decision a long time ago ...
it is not important . """
2010-12-01,"Tony Blair , urged by his culture secretary , Tessa Jowell , to support a London 2012 Olympic bid , asked her : "" Yes , but suppose we get beaten and , what 's worse , we get beaten by the French and I end up humiliated ?
"" If the bookies are right , mortification stalks David Cameron here in Zurich .
The prime minister zoomed in to woo the Fifa brotherhood with familiar Teflon bonhomie .
Unlike Blair , a creature of more transparent calculation , Cameron looked undaunted by the political machinations engulfing England 's wish to stage World Cup games in Plymouth , Bristol and Milton Keynes .
While Cameron set about emulating Blair 's victory of bringing the 2012 Games to Britain , David Beckham went on autopilot to a Zurich school to provide 200 local youngsters with a chance to scream and play fiveâ€‘aâ€‘side with the world 's most famous apprentice diplomat .
A presence in more children 's lives than Santa Claus , Beckham is fast running out of educational establishments to visit .
A curious conceit is at play in football 's Vatican .
The effort expended by Cameron , the former England captain and Prince William is meant to foster a belief that wavering Fifa executive committee members can still be swayed by power smiles and a boyish love for the game .
Beckham was equipped with a handy soundbite to drive home the boast that the English are the most passionate would - be hosts in the entire history of passion .
He said : "" We believe we are No1 to try and get the World Cup because we are a country where football runs through our DNA . ""
Thus genetics make their Fifa vote debut .
Beckham has played the iconic supplicant cleverly .
But after the Sunday Times and Panorama exposÃ © s â€ “ not to mention fierce lobbying by Russia and Spain / Portugal on behalf of their own bids
â€ “
it requires an actor 's stubbornness to go on grinning from the stage like this and belting out old lines .
If the English bid falls foul of self - interest , you can picture the team backstage scraping off make - up and having a good cry .
"" The fact the prime minister came over here so early sends out the right tone , "" Beckham said .
"" To have someone like the prime minister supporting what we are trying to do for the country is a hell of a statement . ""
But what kind of statement would that be ?
First , that Cameron is refreshingly oblivious to the stigma Blair dreaded : a measure of the PM 's born - to - rule self - assurance .
Or it may just be that he would go anywhere to escape a noisy student protest .
A sheen of evasive intent was painted across his features , though , as he was referred to the allegations of corruption now clawing away at Fifa 's credibility .
"" I 've only got one focus here and that 's trying to bring the World Cup home for England .
That 's going to be my focus , talking to the decision - makers and pressing them on the brilliance of English football and what we can bring for this bid , "" Cameron said .
"" That 's going to be my concern , nothing else . ""
This is the power of football and of Fifa .
In few other spheres could a prime minister dismiss questions about $ 100 m ( Â£62.4 m ) in alleged kick - backs and vote - selling in the very process he has given up three days to influence .
Beckham was more candid .
From the airport the England 2018 heavyweights set their co - ordinates for Sepp Blatter , the Fifa president , who soon raised the Panorama problem . ""
He brought it up within the talks and obviously it was not the easiest of things to talk about , "" Beckham admitted .
"" Trust me our media will be right behind a World Cup in our country and trust me everybody in our country wants a World Cup . ""
The passion mantra had been hammered into Fifa 's ears long before Russia surged to odds - on favouritism this week .
There is no choice but to repeat it in these final hours , unless you take the view that withdrawing the England bid on moral grounds would do more for football than pleading with 22 quasi - oligarchs who resist almost every form of scrutiny .
England have sent royalty , official ( Prince William ) and unofficial ( Beckham ) , as well as a new prime minister , in a delegation of 30 , but a bigger political beast may rise from the lake .
All the talk in Zurich was about what message would be transmitted should Vladimir Putin fail to materialise to support the Russian candidacy .
Some thought it would signify an acceptance of defeat but
other Kremlin - watchers said it would mean Putin had been advised his country has already won .
Russia 's prime minister ( how that title fails to convey his power ) is the most influential player but England 's "" three lions "" as Andy Anson , the chief executive called the PM , the prince and the billboard king , are a cheerier and more idealistic bunch , in a town that blurs the line between enthusiasm and hucksterism ."
2010-12-01,"Even the frenzy surrounding David Beckham , Prince William and David Cameron could not compete .
For all the frantic activity from the so - called "" three lions "" in their efforts to host the World Cup in England in 2018 , the most arresting announcement today was from a man who wo n't be in Zurich for the crucial vote .
The Russian prime minister , Vladimir Putin , said he would not be travelling to Switzerland for the vote tomorrow afternoon and , in an apparent attempt to reignite ill - feeling against England 's bid after British media revelations of Fifa corruption , he hit out against "" smears "" against those who will decide .
It has long been assumed that Putin , who made a decisive personal intervention to help Sochi win the winter Olympics for 2014 , would travel to Zurich for the vote only if he was sure of victory .
His decision not to travel was seen as a boost by an upbeat England bid team , who feel they are gaining momentum .
"" This is our time , "" declared Beckham today as he stuck to the English dictum of accentuating the positives – record profits , full stadiums and investment in global legacy projects – rather than dwelling on the reaction to British media exposés of Fifa corruption . ""
Today felt as if it had turned , the momentum was right behind us and we have the support of the country and many other countries , "" said Beckham .
"" To be able to bring the biggest sporting event to your country would be huge . ""
While still describing themselves as underdogs , the England bid team 's odds shortened today as they attempted to calibrate the myriad ways in which the 22 votes on offer might be distributed as candidate bids drop out of the running .
England 's strategy rests on getting enough votes to proceed through a tight first round , in which Holland / Belgium are expected to be knocked out , then getting past Russia and facing Spain / Portugal in a final shootout .
Spain and Portugal have eschewed England 's high - profile approach in favour of behind the scenes lobbying by their influential executive committee member , Angel Maria Villar Llona .
After a whistle - stop trip to Westminster for prime minister 's questions , Cameron flew back to join Prince William and Beckham ahead of the decision by Fifa 's executive committee .
His spokesman predicted the race would "" go to the wire "" .
The prime ministers of Holland , Belgium , South Korea , Portugal and Spain will all be represented , as well as the Emir of Qatar .
Other celebrities and political heavyweights present include Elle Macpherson , Bill Clinton and Morgan Freeman , alongside a string of famous footballers .
In a presentation ahead of the vote , England will deploy Cameron , Prince William and Beckham alongside their "" secret weapon "" – Eddie Afekafe , a 27-year - old community worker for Manchester City .
Three films will demonstrate the strength of England 's technical bid and its legacy credentials , featuring Premier League players and managers including Sir Alex Ferguson and Steven Gerrard .
Beckham kept up his lobbying effort today and Prince William met the Paraguayan executive committee member , Nicolas Leoz , one of four who faced corruption allegations in Monday night 's BBC Panorama programme , over breakfast . ""
Getting the Olympic Games to London was special but as a footballer , an England player , this would be really , really special , "" said Beckham , who had also been deployed to lobby executive committee members vital to England 's chances of progressing through the first round .
As Cameron flew back to Zurich to resume a lobbying frenzy expected to continue into the early hours , Putin attempted to call time on a tradition started by Tony Blair in 2005 when last - ditch lobbying helped secure the Olympics for London . ""
Given the situation I believe it better to refrain from going , particularly because I respect Fifa and Fifa executive committee members and want them to be able to make the decision objectively without any pressure from the outside .
Incidentally , I am calling on my foreign counterparts to do the same , "" he said .
For all England 's claimed momentum there is a danger that the high - profile final push might not be enough to compensate for a lack of political clout in Fifa 's corridors of power .
President Obama , enjoying his post - election honeymoon last year , made a last - ditch dash to Copenhagen to secure the Olympics for Chicago only to see it end in the first round of voting .
"" There is a lot read into this , whether there is political damage or not .
I think most people realise it 's the right thing for a political leader or head of state to do , "" said Lord Coe , the England 2018 board member who played a pivotal role in securing the London 2012 games ."
2010-12-01,"If England win The bid team If England is chosen by a majority of the 22 Fifa executive committee members left standing after corruption allegations , the FA 's bid team will argue that every means employed in the chase justified the end .
Led by the chief executive Andy Anson , chief of staff Simon Greenberg and international president David Dein , they will be celebrated for delivering the first World Cup finals for 52 years .
Euphoria will shower the prime minister David Cameron , Prince William and David Beckham with a burnish to their image .
The bid team will be much less likely to face critical questions about their tactics , from the personal lobbying of individual executive committee members to this week 's undignified attack on BBC Panorama .
Access to matches Fans ' dreams of a World Cup at home will lead rapidly to a focus on how affordable tickets will be for ordinary people who have been encouraged throughout to "" back the bid "" .
England 's central selling point to Fifa to Fifa has been to make huge money , with an explicit promise that more than one million tickets will be priced at an average US$ 95 ( about £ 60 ) .
At the same time , the bid has made a virtue of social and ethnic diversity , so the FA will come under pressure not to price out all but the middle - aged and wealthy .
Stadiums
The bid is based on the argument that the stadiums , transport and infrastructure are mostly ready now , but away from the major football cities this is not quite so .
The 12 provisionally selected venues can be whittled down to eight by Fifa , and there are questions over whether viable , modern 40,000-seat stadiums can be built in the cities of Milton Keynes , Plymouth and Nottingham , and whether Sheffield Wednesday 's Hillsborough can be got up to standard .
The England team There will soon be worries about how England will perform against the world 's great football nations on home turf .
By 2018 last summer 's flops will have retired , the next wave fielded in last month 's defeat to France has yet to convince , so the FA will pray that the under-17 players who won this year 's European Championship will come through .
There will be a renewed argument that Premier League clubs should give more first - team opportunities to young English players .
Reform of the FA
The World Cup will have been claimed by an FA whose chairman , Lord Triesman , was cast out after a Mail on Sunday sting , and with an acting chairman , Roger Burden , so far invisible to the football public .
Having a World Cup to organise will concentrate the authorities ' and government 's minds on the structure and leadership of the governing body .
Some believe a World Cup will help reformers to argue for more FA independence , while others fear the glory factor will enable the organisation to paper over its faults .
Dealing with Fifa
The England bid and prime minister may have made themselves hostages to fortune by evading , and in the bid team 's case attacking , Panorama 's allegations that three members of Fifa 's executive committee took bribes .
Hosting will bring Fifa much closer to the British public and media .
Despite Sepp Blatter 's insistence this week that "" the case is closed "" , the corruption questions have not been answered .
As the reality of meeting Fifa 's demands , including the tax - free status , and servicing its executive committee members , becomes clearer , scrutiny will deepen .
Seven and a half years is a long time for David Cameron to avoid the question about whether England should be so eagerly servicing an organisation that stands accused of taking $ 100 m in bribes .
If England lose The bid team Critical questions will be asked about the bid team 's tactics , from the personal lobbying of individual committee members to this week 's undignified attack on BBC 's Panorama programme , which alleged that three of the executive committee members took bribes .
All the issues that spiked controversy will return , principally whether the country , its prime minister and football custodians , should have kowtowed so completely to Fifa .
The media The messengers will come under attack , too .
Throughout , the bid team has apparently accepted that Fifa 's decision - makers could reject England 's bid because a small part of our free press has taken an investigative view of Fifa , not just cheered the bid along .
The bid team may seek to lay at least part of the blame on Panorama and the Sunday Times for their investigations into alleged corruption at the heart of Fifa .
Both can be expected to stand by their journalism and , in Panorama 's case , the timing of the programme , whose merits – making serious allegations of corruption – may become more appreciated over time .
Reform of the FA English football will return to the inward - looking process suspended by all in an agreed ceasefire , contemplating its structure and politics , and need for reform .
Attention will focus on the FA , rudderless since Triesman was felled , seeking a permanent chairman and some authority to govern the game .
Issues will include the FA 's independence from the all - powerful Premier League , the league 's governance including the relentless sale of clubs to a mishmash of overseas interests , a failure to develop young players for a successful national team , ticket prices , as well as the quality of the game 's , and the government 's , approach to football 's grass roots .
Reform of Fifa
The bidding process , whatever the outcome , has exposed the shortcomings of world football 's governing body , and its lack of a modern culture of transparency , more than ever before .
Two executive committee members , Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii , are suspended from voting having been exposed in a basic undercover sting by the Sunday Times .
Panorama 's allegations , that $ 100 m of bribes have been paid to Fifa members , including the three named , can not be waved away and left unanswered for ever .
When next ?
Cruelly for the generation not born at the time or not old enough in 1966 to bask in Alf Ramsey and his team 's triumph , failure will mean England can not host a World Cup until 2030 at the earliest .
If the FA was to bid for it , and if successful finally , it would be 64 years since England hosted its last one – truly a lifetime .

The rapper is promoting his new single by proposing it for Prince William 's stag do .

2010-12-02,"In 2006 Eddie Afekafe was just another directionless young man from Manchester 's Moss Side , who was terrified his life was being sucked into a vortex of long - term unemployment or crime – or worse .
At around 10 am this morning in Zurich the 26-year - old was presented as the trump card in England 's bid to win the 2018 World Cup from Fifa .
Before Prince William and David Beckham were allowed the stage to tell Sepp Blatter , the Fifa president , and the 22 executive committee members , precisely why they should vote to bring the tournament here in eight years ' time , Afekafe stole the 30-minute show by offering up his story of redemption - by - football as the defining reason why England should host the festival .
With its modern stadia and thriving Premier League the FA 's bid apparently lacked any legacy value .
That was before Afekafe started speaking .
After revealing that he had been unemployed for four years and that he had friends in gangs and prison , Afekafe said : "" What I got , what they did n't get , was an opportunity .
And that opportunity came through football . ""
A World Cup here "" could change the lives of millions of people like me "" .
Afekafe 's big chance came at Moss Side 's Jobcentre when he learned of the Team programme , organised by Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service , a part of the the Prince 's Trust Football Initiative – a partnership with the Premier League and the PFA Football Foundation .
Team took him to Manchester City and after a development award from the Prince 's Trust Football Initiative he took an FA level two coaching qualification and landed a job at Eastlands , working first as the club 's play and adventure co - ordinator before becoming a social inclusion manager .
That role has him encouraging and inspiring the next raft of young and potentially directionless people he had once been among before football intervened .
Afekafe 's performance before Blatter , the 22 exco members , and a global audience of millions was flawless , with no hints of the woodenness displayed by England 's future king and Beckham .
Afekafe 's mother , Elizabeth , witnessed her son 's star turn from the family home in Ardwick .
She said : "" We watched him on TV and the phone has n't stopped ringing since he appeared .
I 'm very proud . ""
Afekafe will be hoping millions of football lovers echo that and herald him as the bid 's X factor ."
2010-12-02,"England 's 2018 World Cup bid ended in crushing failure yesterday , as a team led by David Cameron , David Beckham and Prince William crashed out in the first round of voting in Zurich after securing just two votes from Fifa 's delegates .
Afterwards , shellshocked bid executives blamed voters who had "" looked us in the eye and lied "" .
Executive committee members said a backlash against the British media over their investigations into alleged Fifa corruption may have been a factor in the England bid 's woeful performance .
Russia , long - time favourites who had promised to "" make history "" , comprehensively defeated combined bids by Spain and Portugal and Holland and Belgium in the second round of voting .
The late intervention of Cameron and the prince , and a well - received final presentation in which 27-year - old Manchester City community worker Eddie Afekafe played a starring role , had raised hopes .
But the ashen faces of a bid delegation that also included Gary Lineker and Boris Johnson told their own story as they filed into the Zurich Messe for the announcement .
Afterwards , they expressed shock and disbelief as Johnson declared : "" Fifa ca n't last in its current form . ""
A huge inquest is likely to follow into a campaign that cost £ 15 m , amid further scrutiny of Fifa and its processes .
The England team went into yesterday 's ceremony believing it had secured enough votes to make it through the first round and could see "" a path to victory "" .
But as so often on the pitch , England 's team had raised hope of an unlikely victory before being comprehensively outmanoeuvred by the opposition and left shell - shocked by the result .
Vladimir Putin , the Russian prime minister , who launched a broadside against the British media yesterday but raised hopes among the English team when he said he would not travel to Zurich , arrived in the Swiss city last night for a triumphant press conference .
Fifa 's cash cow will also go to the Middle East for the first time after the oil - rich emirate of Qatar , which started the bidding race as a rank outsider but defeated the United States by 14 votes to eight in the concluding round , won the race to host the 2022 tournament .
The opaque bidding process was marked not only by a series of internal difficulties for the English bid but a string of allegations of corruption and collusion among those who would decide its fate .
A Sunday Times investigation that led to six senior officials being suspended and a BBC Panorama documentary that implicated four more led to a backlash against the British media among some Fifa executives .
Chuck Blazer , the USA Fifa executive committee member , said : "" It did n't create a positive environment for the England bid
but it 's difficult to get into the minds of other people and know if it really was a factor .
"" England 's representative , Geoff Thompson , counted for one vote , while Japan 's Junji Ogura may have provided the other . ""
For me the biggest disappointment is that we clearly had the best technical bid , the best economic evaluation , everyone has told me we had the best presentation , "" said the 2018 chief executive , Andy Anson , afterwards .
He said that voters who had looked into his eyes and shaken hands on a pledge to support England had changed their minds .
Cameron , who spent two spells in Zurich punctuated by a trip home for prime minister 's questions and lobbied late into the night in an attempt to replicate Tony Blair 's role in securing the London Olympics , said : "" In the end it turns out having the best technical bid , the best commercial bid , a passion for football , that 's not enough .
It 's desperately sad . ""
Other contributory factors may have included the fact that England lack a dynamic political operator at the top level of the world game and lost a year to internal infighting at the beginning of the bid .
Beckham , who had earlier delivered a moving contribution to a slick presentation that concentrated on the contribution an English World Cup could make to global football , said he was devastated .
"" We did n't expect it to happen .
We all felt we had put ourselves in a strong position to get the World Cup in our country in 2018 , "" he said .
Others suggested that Fifa 's philosophy of taking football to new territories and the emphasis on legacy building had informed the decision and left England facing an uphill struggle from the start .
But few expected England to lose in such humiliating fashion .
Lord Mawhinney , who sat on the 2018 advisory board , said : "" That may be the explanation , or a hint at policy , in which case we will have to think about things . """
2010-12-02,"For the second time in six months England were crushed by the World Cup .
After the humiliation of a 4 - 1 defeat to Germany in South Africa came another resounding rejection for the mother country .
Shuttle diplomacy of David Cameron , Prince William and David Beckham yesterday only succeeded in exposing the English bid as out of touch with the brutal realities of Fifa 's politics ; Vladimir Putin scored a victory over his British counterpart without even being in Zurich for the ballot .
Instead , Russia 's prime minister swept in last night recounting tales of the bombardment of Leningrad in the second world war and how football had helped Russians endure "" tragic "" deprivation .
He told the Fifa executive committee , after they had awarded England only two votes out of a possible 22 : "" We 're honoured by your decision .
From the bottom of my heart , thank you . ""
So much for the English late charm offensive .
Fifa treated their bid with contempt .
From No 10 downward the leaders of England 's bid mis - read the signals and frittered £ 15 m on a campaign that failed to leave a dent in Russia 's quest to use football to force through infrastructure change .
Putin 's greater mission in the hours before the vote had been to deny on CNN 's Larry King Live and in other media outlets that Russia was a "" mafia state "" as alleged via WikiLeaks .
From out of this morass , he was able to pull a PR coup that sums up Fifa 's manic commercialism .
Russia won 13 of the 22 votes in round two to achieve an absolute majority , while Qatar beat the US 14 - 8 in the fourth round of polling for 2022 .
In the pain of defeat , Richard Scudamore , the Premier League chief executive , doubted whether England would ever stage another global gathering .
"" It almost feels they 've got us on standby for when someone suddenly ca n't host it .
But on that basis we might never get it . ""
The sun - buttered summer of 1966 , when Bobby Moore raised the former Jules Rimet trophy at Wembley , recedes to vanishing point .
With a better bid than in 2006 , England regressed in the affections of Fifa members .
Five votes last time became two in this ballot 's opening round .
One came from Geoff Thompson , England 's representative at the world governing body , known fondly as "" Uncle Albert "" for his resemblance to the Only Fools and Horses character .
So the vision of World Cup matches at Plymouth , Bristol and Milton Keynes attracted only one neutral , with 20 votes blanking out Cameron and Beckham .
As the throng shuffled into a conference hall in Zurich to hear Sepp Blatter , the Fifa president , declare , "" We go to new lands , "" Alan Shearer and Gary Lineker , two England legends , wore expressions as grim as any they came off the field with after penalty shoot - out defeats .
In those instants of crushing rejection we saw the romanticism of the English candidacy collide with Fifa 's urge to open goldmines in post - Soviet republics and in the Gulf oil states . ""
Never has the World Cup been in Russia and eastern Europe , and the Middle East and Arabic world have been waiting for a long time ,
so I 'm a happy president when we talk about the development of football , "" said Blatter .
Also at work was antipathy to the English game , with its globally dominant Premier League , lavish bid proposals , and inquisitive media –
the latter having alleged vote - selling by two Fifa executive committee members ( Sunday Times ) and the sharing out of $ 100 m in kick - backs ( the BBC 's Panorama ) .
Asked whether fear of journalistic scrutiny played a part , Scudamore said : "" It has n't helped . ""
"" In football we also learn to lose , "" Blatter said , piously .
England are doing plenty of that this year .
A World Cup in 2018 might have redressed the imbalance between Premier League power and the international game .
Instead Fifa 's talent for political chicanery has caused England to appear naive .
As Russia took the prize , one of the first to his feet was Roman Abramovich , Chelsea 's owner , a close ally of Putin . ""
Thank you for believing in change , "" said Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al - Thani , emir of Qatar .
Shearer said : If we could n't get this World Cup then will we [ ever ] get one ?
I have n't seen one in England in my lifetime .
The last one was 1966 , and I was dearly hoping for this one .
It 's like coming off the football pitch when you say ' I could n't have done any more ' ; we could n't have done any more . ""
Bitterness was suppressed .
Only Boris Johnson , London mayor , spoke of the need for reform at Fifa .
Scudamore , though , urged English fans to seek refuge at Chelsea , Arsenal and Manchester United . ""
The fundamentals of English football do n't alter , do they ?
People will still be shouting on Saturday , people will still be playing , "" he said .
"" The game will continue on the trajectory it 's on in England . ""
In Bloemfontein and Zurich , though , the "" fundamentals "" were farcical and haunting ."
2010-12-02,"A World Cup bid campaign that began amid acrimonious infighting ended tonight with England 's team united in shock and anger at a result that was below even their worst expectations .
For all the false confidence engendered by the late lobbying push from Prince William , David Cameron and David Beckham and an inspirational presentation fronted by a 27-year - old Manchester City community worker , the desperately disappointing denouement was perhaps apt for a rollercoaster process that has continually endured more downs than ups .
In the end , the analogy was not with Tony Blair 's charismatic intervention in Singapore to win the Olympics for London but with Copenhagen last year , when the US president , Barack Obama , came to lobby for his home city of Chicago and rescue a troubled campaign but suffered a humiliating first‑round exit .
Even before the campaign was launched at Wembley in April , England 's bid team were battling against events .
The bid was born against a backdrop of acrimony , with complaints about too many political appointees at the expense of "" football people "" and a divisive row with the Premier League .
The former bid chairman Lord Triesman , against the backdrop of an incendiary but ultimately prescient speech about debt levels in the Premier League , was on a war footing with his top‑flight partners , who were considered the English game 's biggest calling card abroad .
That was eventually smoothed over by Andy Anson , the bid 's chief executive , but perhaps more problematic was the fact that Geoff Thompson , criticised for his low‑key manner but England 's only member of the executive committees at Fifa and Uefa , had been ostracised by Lord Triesman when he succeeded him as chairman of the Football Association .
If set‑piece events being undermined by rows over ultimately petty matters was a recurring theme , so too was the presence of one man in the doomed narrative .
Jack Warner – the Concacaf president who has held England 's chances in his hands throughout the process and ultimately stabbed them in the back by taking his three votes to Russia – criticised the presence of a British National Party councillor at that Wembley launch .
That autumn , England 2018 was caught in a storm when Warner cautioned that the "" lightweight "" bid was "" creeping along when it should be galloping "" .
Another row at the Leaders in Football conference did not help .
The sense of crisis deepened , with noises off all round and a constant drip , drip of damaging leaks as English football 's parochial concerns were played out using the bid as a canvas .
A year was essentially lost as the bid team , led by the capable Anson , struggled to construct a coherent message and instead were forced to deal with the fallout from internal rows .
Led by advice from the board members Lord Coe and Sir Keith Mills , veterans of the London 2012 Olympics race , the board was successfully streamlined .
Even that was not the end of the strife as the Premier League chairman , Sir Dave Richards , flounced out over a perceived slight and overshadowed the submission of the various bids from stadiums around the country .
It was another key moment undermined .
But Anson eventually successfully calmed the warring tribes and the recruitment of David Dein as international president appeared to signal a new determination to calibrate the fine margins required to navigate the apparently calm but ultimately cut - throat waters of international football politics .
As the result ultimately proved , even Dein – a seasoned fixture on the world football circuit – was perhaps out of his depth .
Anson insisted tonight that they were "" not naive "" but when it came to the crunch , as in the vote for the 2006 World Cup , England simply could not play the international politics .
In April , there was the hammer blow of Triesman 's resignation following a Mail on Sunday sting that still provokes fierce debate questioning its morality .
Yet there are those on the bid who believe his departure galvanised the team and liberated it from some of the tensions that had dogged it from the start .
England then appeared to enjoy a more successful period , as they repeated their trick from the World Cup draw in December and successfully parachuted Beckham and Princes William and Harry into Johannesburg to schmooze executive committee members before the tournament began .
A well - received successful inspection visit followed in August , but if the result shows anything it highlights the extent to which those visits – the bid books , the technical reports that followed , the economic assessment and even the final presentations – were ultimately window dressing .
All came second to deal - making and old prejudices .
The three‑dimensional chess involved in constructing alliances and securing votes in a flawed parallel bidding process also worked against England .
Anson admitted the £ 3 m spent on the bid book was ultimately "" wasted "" – money that could have been spent on grassroots football projects of the kind that Fifa is so keen to foster .
Another factor in England 's defeat were the so - called media "" smears "" that its rivals so successfully turned against it .
Despite the Sunday Times investigation leading to six Fifa officials being suspended and the BBC 's Panorama apparently implicating four more ( including Warner ) , sending Fifa into a tailspin , a furious backlash coalesced against England 's bid .
In recent days , the bid team thought that the charm of a prince , a prime minister and former England captain had helped to placate them .
They were wrong .
A shell - shocked Anson paid tribute to his team but was candid in his belief that England would have to rethink its relationship with international football if it was ever to win the beauty parade .
"" We do n't have a [ Michel ] Platini and we do n't have a [ Franz ] Beckenbauer , but we also do n't integrate ourselves into the international community well , "" he said .
"" That has been a problem all along .
Geoff Thompson has done a good job and he is a solid guy but he is stuck out there in Fifa and Uefa on his own ; he 's not really integrated into the FA and the Premier League .
"" What the past week and to an extent the past six months have done is largely insulate the bid team from criticism .
The late lobbying effort has masked their earlier failings .
The questions now will run deeper than whether England should have handed out carrier bags at a football conference and focus on the structural failings of English football and Fifa .
As the shaken team looked for answers amid the wreckage of the failed bid , there was also a sense that Fifa 's philosophy to take the World Cup to drive into new territories for commercial and philosophical reasons meant that they were always fighting an uphill battle .
There was a lingering feeling throughout the race that with English football 's riches and global reach , it just did not need Fifa 's greatest prize and main cash cow enough .
The backlash against the media gave those looking for an excuse not to back England the perfect opportunity .
"" What was interesting was what the president said at the end about taking the World Cup to two new territories and , in Qatar 's case , mentioning Arab countries .
That was the driver .
They have decided to take the World Cups to developing areas , "" said the Premier League chief executive , Richard Scudamore , who belatedly came on board and backed the bid .
"" What 's gone against us is not having to build 20 new stadia .
It almost feels as if we are on standby for when somebody ca n't host it .
That 's all very well but on that basis we will never get it . """

2010-12-09,"He may be being made redundant but there is some consolation – apart from the hefty payoff , of course – for outgoing BBC deputy director general Mark Byford .
Monkey hears he has been leading the BBC 's planning for its royal wedding coverage , along with legendary BBC events boss Nick Vaughan - Barratt .
A meeting was held between all the main UK broadcasters and Buckingham Palace last Wednesday to talk about how they will cover the marriage of Prince William and Kate Middleton on 29 April next year .
The BBC has yet to finalise its main presenter , though it is expected to be David Dimbleby , while Sky is still planning to film it in 3D and may broadcast it in cinemas and pubs .
Hopefully viewers wo n't get their 3D glasses and beer goggles mixed up ."
2010-12-13,"The BBC confirmed today that the veteran broadcaster David Dimbleby was to play no part in its coverage of the royal wedding next year .
The corporation said the BBC 's news anchor Huw Edwards would lead its coverage , on radio and television , of Prince William 's marriage to Kate Middleton at Westminster Abbey on 29 April . ""
Huw is the BBC 's go - to man for the big state occasions now , "" a spokesman said .
The decision not to hand the BBC 's Question Time presenter a role ends an association between Dimbleby 's family , the BBC and the royals that began more than 50 years ago .
It also prompted speculation about Dimbleby 's position at the BBC , where he has long been entrusted with leading coverage of big national events .
David 's father , Richard Dimbleby , a senior BBC journalist , anchored the corporation 's coverage of the funeral of King George VI in 1952 , and of Queen Elizabeth 's coronation the next year .
In 1997 the BBC adopted the hereditary principle and placed the younger Dimbleby at the head of its coverage of the funeral of Princess Diana .
David was also the anchor for the Queen Mother 's funeral in 2002 and the Queen 's golden jubilee celebrations the same year .
Dimbleby has also fronted every general election night since 1979 for the BBC .
However , BBC executives have been grooming Edwards , the BBC1 10 pm news bulletin presenter , to take on Dimbleby 's role as the nation 's unofficial master of ceremonies .
Edwards commentated on the Pope 's visit to Britain in September and also led the coverage of the state opening of parliament and the remembrance festival this autumn .
He also headed up the reporting of the Beijing Olympics ceremonies in 2008 .
The move led to speculation within the BBC that Dimbleby could be paying the price for its lacklustre coverage of the US presidential election in 2008 .
He was criticised for an unsteady performance and an apparent lack of preparation .
He failed to identify key political figures , including the senator and former vice - presidential candidate Joe Lieberman .
"" I think that might have been his undoing , "" a senior BBC source said .
The Question Times host One of the most memorable moments came when an irritated Gore Vidal , the American author , took Dimbleby to task for his line of questioning and told him : "" I do n't know who you are . ""
The exchange , which ended when a blushing Dimbleby brought it to an abrupt conclusion , became an instant YouTube hit .
However , Dimbleby was widely praised for his work anchoring the BBC 's general election coverage in May , when he put in a marathon shift from Thursday evening until the following afternoon , with only a short break on the Friday morning .
BBC sources said Dimbleby would continue to be the face of its political coverage .
Dimbleby 's younger brother , Jonathan , who presents Radio 4 's weekend political panel show Any Questions , is also part of of the family media dynasty .
The brothers often compete on election nights , with David leading the BBC 's coverage and Jonathan anchoring ITV 's output .
Edwards will continue to combine his new duties with his role as presenter of BBC1 's flagship 10 pm bulletin , a high profile position he has filled since 2003 .
That will disappoint some senior news figures at the corporation , who had hoped Edwards , 49 , would relinquish his newsreading role as he concentrated on bigger one - off state occasions .
"" Some of the second - string newsreaders hoped [ BBC1 6 pm bulletin anchor ] George [ Alagiah ] would replace Huw and that would create a vacancy at the ' six ' "" , said the BBC source .
The BBC will announce other members of its royal wedding reporting team in January.ends â€¢
This article was amended on 14 December 2010 .
The original said that King George VI 's funeral was in 1953 and Queen Elizabeth 's coronation was the same year .
This has been corrected ."
2010-12-13,"The news that Prince William and Kate Middleton are to be advised on their forthcoming marriage by the bishop of London has drawn a lot of sour comment .
But marriage preparation is part of the job of any priest , rabbi , imam : almost all societies recognise that marriage is a state that people must be educated into .
As the prayer book says : "" It is not by any to be enterprised , nor taken in hand , unadvisedly , lightly , or wantonly , to satisfy men 's carnal lusts and appetites . ""
No one could nowadays say those words to a stranger with the expectation of being understood , but their message is still true .
So how is it got across ?
This week we are asking people from widely different religious and irreligious traditions what advice they give to people who come to them and ask to be married .
And , while we 're at it , we 're asking you .
If you were asked to perform a ceremony , what would you ask to make sure that they were ready , and properly serious ?
Or is it nobody else 's business
but the couple 's ?
Monday 's response Rosie Harper :
A superficial marriage pep talk sells people short .
As Christians we must express our beliefs and engage with our spiritual side Thursday 's response Rupert Morris : Those seeking a humanist wedding want to celebrate their love with the people , ideas and things they care about most Friday 's response Edward Clare : The church needs to build on young couples ' positive vision of their marriage , not offer preparation that presents it as a gamble"

2010-12-19,"It 's probably fair to say the prime motivation for Prince William 's decision to study at St Andrews was n't financial , but he still saved his father a few quid by coming north .
Although non - Scottish students from the rest of the UK pay to attend Scottish universities , the charge is substantially less than that levied by institutions south of the border and a fraction of the proposed maximum of £ 9,000 outlined by Vince Cable 's progressive funding package for England .
Unlikely as it may seem , William may – as king – have rather fewer subjects to reign over because of dramatic changes in the fees structure for students following in his footsteps .
University funding is bringing into sharp focus the deficiencies in the financial relationship between Edinburgh and London – and the consequences could be constitutional as well as educational .
When he outlined his plans for English universities the business secretary made a point of warning the Scottish government not to reject Westminster 's lead on fees , saying Scotland risked becoming an intellectual backwater .
The Holyrood education secretary , Mike Russell , responded by reasserting the traditional Scottish view that a university education confers general as well as individual benefits , and said any form of graduate contribution for Scottish students would only be considered as a last resort .
In fact , Scottish students have not had to pay tuition fees for 10 years – after a deal brokered by a coalition government in which the Lib Dems were the junior partner .
How times change .
Now the proposals have prompted fears that Scottish students may soon be crowded out of local universities by fee refugees from England .
This , in turn has led the SNP to propose a substantial increase in fees charged to English , Welsh and Northern Irish students considering studying in Scotland .
The original abolition of fees in Scotland prompted a spurious "" land of milk and honey "" argument – the idea that Scots were enjoying significant extra benefits , largely on the backs of English taxpayers .
This argument seems set to intensify if Scottish students continue to study for free .
But those fulminating against the apparent injustice should be directing their fire at the coalition government and not the SNP , struggling to maintain the principle of free education .
The real difficulty comes from the way public spending is distributed in the different countries of the UK .
Because money for public services in Scotland is determined by changes to budgets in English services , the huge cut in public funding for English university teaching will be passed on to the Scottish government .
Ministers in Edinburgh could choose to spare Scottish universities , but would then have to make equivalent cuts elsewhere .
Most politicians in Scotland now accept that this straitjacket approach is no longer acceptable .
Labour , the Conservatives and the Lib Dems are all backing limited plans to give the Scottish parliament more power to set income tax rates .
The SNP is bound to cite university funding as another reason why a much more comprehensive and simpler system is needed – one in which Scotland raises and keeps all its revenue , without any messy cross - border transfers and all the accompanying rancour .
Indeed , the first minister , Alex Salmond , has already pledged to make university funding and financial independence key themes of the next Scottish elections , in May.
Cable may have predicted decline for Scotland 's universities , but he may have given a helping hand to those who would rather see the end of a more outdated institution – the political union between England and Scotland ."
2010-12-19,"He may already be the nation 's most popular newsreader , but Huw Edwards , the Welshman who presents the BBC 's 10 O'clock News , has now been given the royal seal of approval .
The 49-year - old from Bridgend will be anchoring the BBC 's coverage of Prince William 's marriage to Kate Middleton in the spring , a national celebration that will demand the deftest of presentational performances .
The role confirms Edwards 's status as one of the brightest , and most respected , stars at the BBC .
It is also a signal perhaps that he has been installed as the nation 's new master of ceremonies , the baton passing to him from David Dimbleby .
Certainly , BBC executives believe that Edwards is a man able to judge the public mood ; not one to make a gaffe that would live long in the memory .
There is a theory advanced by his detractors – although it has to be said there are not too many of them – that Edwards is a safe pair of hands rather than a presenter of rare talent , a man who has risen to the top of his profession by adopting a safety - first approach to the job . ""
He is conservative with a small ' c ' , "" says one senior BBC presenter .
"" He got where he is by not taking any chances … if you think of [ Jeremy ] Paxman or [ John ] Humphrys or [ Brian ] Redhead , there is , or was , something characterful about them . ""
BBC executives respond to that charge by pointing out it would n't sit well with the public to place a journalistic rottweiler in charge of its coverage of a royal wedding .
The role has to be filled by a presenter who can ensure the spotlight remains on the bride and groom .
It should also be noted that Edwards made his name as a newscaster only after forging a reputation as a first - rate reporter .
After a stint at commercial radio station Swansea Sound , he joined the BBC as a trainee in 1984 and subsequently spent more than a decade reporting on Westminster for regional and national TV and radio .
He was attached to Radio 4 's The World at One during the 1992 election , but moved to television towards the end of his stint , covering politics as chief political correspondent in the early 1990s , a role that confined him mainly to the BBC 's rolling news channel .
At the time , the channel , in its infancy , was dogged by technical difficulties and Edwards 's assured performance in challenging circumstances won him an audience of admirers within the organisation .
His big break came when he was given the opportunity to host the Six O'Clock News , using that position to stake a claim for the even more prestigious main bulletin later in the evening .
Roger Mosey , who is in charge of the BBC 's coverage of the 2012 London Olympics but was head of BBC Television News when Edwards was promoted to "" the Six "" , is unstinting in his praise .
"" I like him hugely , "" he says .
"" If you 're a news presenter , you are not known as a stand - up comedian or someone who brings the house down [ but ] he 's very funny , quite gossipy and a witty guy to be with . ""
Mosey adds : "" He has made the 10 O'Clock News the programme that it now is .
Everyone thought we 'd be hammered when we went up against News at 10 . ""
Shifting the news to a later slot so that is clashed with ITV 's nightly programme was a gamble that ultimately paid off and so too has the decision to appoint Edwards to anchor it .
BBC insiders concede he had to battle a powerful minority of viewers who felt that it was inappropriate to have a presenter with a strong Welsh accent fronting the main bulletin .
"" It was quite a significant move , "" says one .
"" There was a lot of push - back [ among audiences ] about regionality .
Now he is incredibly respected and it 's not an issue . ""
"" I think that when I started 20 years ago it was n't a great deal of help , "" says Edwards .
"" I took a decision not to change it though because I felt it was an important part of my identity .
Thankfully today , accents of all kinds are , quite rightly , more acceptable . ""
Edwards played a part in a similar ratings victory when executives at the corporation 's news channel decided to introduce a 5 pm news hour on BBC News , which he presented .
Sky News had established a market - leading position at 5 pm with a show anchored by its award - winning presenter Jeremy Thompson ; now it is the BBC that wins that slot .
But it is only in recent years that Edwards has been groomed for a bigger stage , presenting events which demand a more solemn countenance , including the Festival of Remembrance , the death of Pope John Paul II and the 60th anniversary of D - Day .
Mosey says those roles are difficult to get right . ""
People underestimate things like the Festival of Remembrance , which is live from the Royal Albert Hall in front of the Queen , the entire political establishment and 6 or 7 million viewers . ""
Edwards is valued because BBC executives believe he brings the same serious but accessible demeanour to those occasions as he does to the news and has a good common touch .
He lives a comfortable life in Dulwich , south London with his wife , Vicky Flind , who works on This Week , the BBC 's late - night political show hosted by Andrew Neil . ""
He is very family - oriented , "" says an acquaintance .
"" He does have that sense of ' self - madeness ' that you would have from this background but he 's not chippy at all . ""
Mosey points out : "" On ' the 10 ' , you go from the death of the pope to the final eviction on Big Brother – when you do get the tone wrong it is noticeable . ""
The fact that he rarely turns down work also helps , of course .
"" It 's the same with most presenters , "" says a BBC executive , who recalls asking Edwards why he 'd got up at 5.30am to go to Wolverhampton to film Songs of Praise when he was presenting the news that night .
By choosing him over David Dimbleby , who has commentated on many a national occasion , including Prince Diana 's funeral , some believe the BBC is signalling that Edwards is the "" new Dimbleby "" .
Dimbleby inherited the nation 's MC position from his father , Richard .
However , the passing of that baton from father to son demonstrated it is not just the royal family which adheres to the hereditary principle and the counter - view is that Dimbleby , though now 72 , may yet stake a claim to the next state funeral .
( Dimbleby , though gracious in his response to the Edwards "" appointment "" , suggested funerals might be more his thing . )
Weddings , some point out , are slightly different occasions which tend to be more showbiz than serious news .
However , a BBC spokesman sounded unequivocal last week : "" Huw is the BBC 's go - to man for the big state occasions now "" and the fact that he has also presented the state opening of Parliament suggests Edwards may have his eyes on a bigger prize .
There are some within the BBC who wonder if Edwards may also succeed Dimbleby as the main presenter of the corporation 's election night coverage .
Dimbleby 's views on that prospect – denied by the BBC – have not been recorded , but it safe to assume he would be appalled at the prospect .
Edwards has made very few enemies , but some prominent figures in BBC News were secretly disheartened to learn last week that he would not be relinquishing his 10 o'clock role after taking on further responsibilities . ""
He 's very aware that lots of people have been hoping he 'd be moved because he 's been there for a while , "" according to the BBC spokesman .
Colleagues speak of a professional rivalry with George Alagiah , who presents the 6 pm bulletin and is waiting patiently to land the bigger job , just as Prince Charles is waiting to ascend to the throne .
Edwards is not yet 50 and colleagues joke that Alagiah may be waiting almost as long .
In the meantime , Edwards is likely to be subjected to even greater public scrutiny , while some BBC insiders point out that he might relish being the most prominent Welshman at the wedding of Prince William of Wales .
The BBC spokesman says : "" He 's certainly up there to be knocked down in a way he wo n't have been before . ""
History suggests Edwards will react to that in typically unflappable fashion and perhaps even with a touch of royal disdain ."
2010-12-23,"Kate Middleton has experienced the first harsh reality of her looming royal status – having to endure the unflattering likeness .
As the Royal Mint unveiled its official commemorative £ 5 coin to mark Prince William 's engagement , his bride - to - be may well have wondered who would be walking up the aisleof Westminster Abbey in April .
Rather than a fresh , slim , chisel - nosed Middleton , it seems a heavier , older interloper with the flattened features of a pugilist would be stepping into her bridal shoes .
For while William 's profile bears a slight likeness , his fiancee is nigh - on unrecognisable .
The inspiration for the design came , apparently , from photographs of the couple at a sporting event , and had been approved by the Queen and William .
It 's long been the Queen 's fate to suffer the worst excesses of artistic licence with dignity .
Witness her silence at Lucian Freud 's robust depiction of her with – to paraphrase one critic – a chin sporting a six - o'clock shadow and a neck like a rugby prop forward .
Prince Philip , predictably , was less diplomatic over the efforts of portrait painter Stuart Pearson Wright , showing him bare - chested , with a bluebottle on one shoulder and seedlings growing out of his index finger . ""
Gadzooks ! ""
he exclaimed before demanding , "" why have you given me a great schonk ? ""
Justifying the portrayal of Middleton , a Royal Mint spokesman insisted the design had been through a "" rigorous approval process "" .
The discouraging news for Middleton is it 's just the first of many .
Meanwhile , in her Christmas Day speech tomorrow , the Queen extols the role of sports in building communities , developing social skills and "" providing a different perspective on life "" . ""
In the parks of towns and cities and on village greens up and down the country , countless thousands of people every week give up their time to participate in sport and exercise of all sorts , or simply encourage others to do so , "" she says in an excerpt released by Buckingham Palace ."
2010-12-31,"Could Abba reunite for Prince William and Kate Middleton 's wedding ?
Rumours are swirling after singer Agnetha Fältskog said the group "" could consider "" getting together for a one - off concert next year , with bookmakers posting new odds for a royal wedding performance .
"" It would be fun to get together , "" Fältskog said .
"" It is just a feeling I have . ""
For a long time , an Abba reunion has seemed an impossibility .
"" We will never appear on stage again , "" Björn Ulvaeus told the Sunday Telegraph in 2008 .
"" We would like people to remember us as we were : young , exuberant , full of energy and ambition . ""
But the first sign of changing minds came in September , when singer Anni - Frid Lyngstad , said "" it would be great to do something "" with her former bandmates .
"" It would be hard to avoid all the pressure because of Abba , "" she complained .
"" It could never be low - key . ""
Now , Fältskog seems to be entertaining a full - blown re - formation – at least for one night .
"" We would not reunite for a tour like the Rolling Stones and other old bands do now , "" she reportedly told M magazine . ""
However , I could see us doing something together in the future . ""
Although the Swedish group have not performed together since the 1980s – and have hardly even appeared together in public – Fältskog seems to think the sexagenarians still have it . ""
A reunion , an occasional opportunity , maybe in connection with a charity event , "" she said , "" I believe we could consider it . ""
Ladbrokes has posted odds of 66 - 1 odds for Abba to perform at Prince William and Kate Middleton 's wedding in April – the same odds as for Abba to have a US no 1 in 2011 , or for Mexico to win the 2014 World Cup .
They 're offering rather shorter odds on a handful of other acts : 9 - 4 for Sir Paul McCartney to play , the same odds as Dizzee Rascal .
Why not book all three ?"
2011-01-05,"Clarence House has revealed further details of April 's royal wedding between Prince William and Kate Middleton .
It was not entirely unexpected news – the couple having already ruled out a beach party , a country hotel or a register office – that Middleton will be driven by car to Westminster Abbey along the traditional processional route of the Mall , Horse Guards Parade , Whitehall and Parliament Square .
The service , at 11 am on 29 April , will be conducted by the dean of the abbey , the Very Rev John Hall .
The archbishop of Canterbury , Rowan Williams , will marry the couple and the Right Rev Richard Chartres , the bishop of London and a longstanding friend of the royal family , will give the address .
The couple will return along the same route , but this time in a carriage procession .
The Queen , who has a larger pad than the Middletons , is laying on a reception for the couple 's "" official and private "" guests .
In the evening , when the VIPs have gone and granny and grandad have retired to bed , Prince Charles will host a private dinner followed by dancing for close friends and family .
The reception is being funded by the royal family with the Middletons , who are wealthy from their business in children 's party accessories , chipping in .
The state will bear the cost of security and the troops on parade will be drawn from detachments already on duty in London .

2011-01-06,"January The News of the World 's royal editor , Clive Goodman , is jailed for four months after admitting he intercepted mobile phone messages with the help of a private investigator , Glenn Mulcaire .
The case concerned stories from 2005 involving Prince William that contained information known to few people , raising suspicions in the royal household .
Later the same day , the paper 's editor , Andy Coulson , resigns .
May The Press Complaints Commission ( PCC ) rules after an investigation that there is "" no evidence "" anyone else at the News of the World was aware of Goodman 's activities .
Later in the month Coulson is appointed as the Conservative party 's head of communications .
July A Guardian investigation finds evidence that phone tapping was widespread at the News of the World and that its parent company paid more than £ 1 m to settle legal cases connected to the practice , including £ 400,000 in damages to Gordon Taylor , the chief executive of the Professional Footballers ' Association .
The following week Coulson is questioned by the Commons culture and media select committee , saying that while "" things went badly wrong "" under his editorship he could not have known about the phone hacking .
The Guardian 's Nick Davies shows the committee evidence that other reporters at the paper were involved .
September Giving evidence to the same committee , the former News International chairman Les Hinton denies that the News of the World bought the silence of Goodman .
The reporter sued the paper for unfair dismissal when he was sacked while in prison , but agreed a settlement .
Two months later the PCC sticks to its verdict that phone hacking was not widespread at the News of the World , saying it has found no evidence that it had been "" materially misled "" by the paper .
February
The Commons committee issues a damning report accusing the News of the World of carrying out phone hacking "" on a near industrial scale "" , saying it was inconceivable that senior executives did not know that the practice was taking place .
It is similarly critical of the police , saying Scotland Yard should have broadened its original investigation and not just focused on Goodman .
September The New York Times alleges that Coulson regularly discussed phone hacking while he was News of the World editor .
The US paper says it has spoken to a dozen former reporters and editors who said phone hacking was "" pervasive "" in Coulson 's newsroom .
One unnamed senior reporter said : "" Everyone knew .
The office cat knew . ""
Later , a former senior journalist goes public to make similar allegations .
In November , Coulson is interviewed as a witness by police ; prosecutors later say he will not face charges .
January It emerges that the News of the World 's assistant editor , Ian Edmondson , was suspended before Christmas following a "" serious allegation "" that he was involved with phone hacking – thought to relate to the actor Sienna Miller – when the paper was edited by Coulson .

2011-01-12,"Prince William lobbied David Cameron over plans to cut the number of coastguard stations , the prime minister indicated today .
The second in line to the throne , a rescue helicopter pilot with the RAF , used the occasion of the pair being in Zurich in support of England 's doomed football world cup bid to press for the coastguard to be spared the cuts .
The government is consulting on whether it can cut the number of coastguard stations from 18 to 8 .
"" I have been lobbied extensively about air - sea rescue , including by people from all walks of life , if I can put it that way , "" Cameron told the Commons when pressed on coastguard cuts .
Later the prime minister 's official spokesman did not deny the pair may have spoken about the future of the service .
"" I do n't think we would ever comment on discussions between the prime minister and a member of the royal family , "" he said .
"" They were certainly both in Zurich . ""
A Church of England bishop who was suspended for making disparaging remarks about Prince William 's engagement to Kate Middleton has returned to public duties after spending less than two months in enforced exile .
The Facebook tirade from Pete Broadbent "" appalled "" his immediate superior , the bishop of London , the Right Rev Richard Chartres , who is a close friend of the Prince of Wales .
He promptly announced that Broadbent , bishop of Willesden , was withdrawing from public ministry until further notice , and said he had contacted St James Palace to "" express his dismay "" on behalf of the church .
But Chartres â€ “ who is to give an address at the royal wedding service on 29 April at Westminster Abbey â€ “ has reinstated the cleric less than two months after publicly rebuking him .
One of Broadbent 's critics , Alison Ruoff , who sits on the Church of England 's governing body with him , welcomed his return .
She said : "" I think two months is very sensible .
He deserved what he got .
It was a very silly thing to do , but it is right to reinstate him . ""
In a note circulated to all his diocesan clergy , Chartres said : "" Bishop Peter stands by his full and frank apology for the comments he made about the forthcoming royal wedding .
He is fully focused on the mission of the diocese of London and I welcome his return . ""

2011-01-12,"George VI 's wartime newsreel appearances , we 're told , were regularly interrupted by applause from cinema audiences â€ “ a phenomenon no more common now , at least for British filmgoers , than it was at the time .
All the more peculiar , then , that The King 's Speech â€ “ the box - office smash starring Colin Firth as the same monarch struggling to overcome his debilitating stutter
â€ “ is getting the same reception .
When I saw it at the Odeon Camden on Friday , there was a spontaneous ovation at the end .
A quick straw poll of friends and a click around Google makes clear that this is happening at many screenings .
So what 's going on ?
The most straightforward answer is that it 's a very good film , telling the well - filmed , well - acted story of a sympathetic character overcoming a daunting challenge .
But other films match or better this accomplishment without stirring such a visceral response .
My guess is that The King 's Speech taps into something more deeply , resonantly British , something that speaks to culturally ingrained notions of shared adversity and earned deference around the royal family .
The current period of economic hardship had barely begun before comparisons were being made to the spirit of the Blitz and stiff - upper - lip perseverance .
The outstanding example is probably the revival of the second world war "" Keep Calm and Carry On "" "" poster , of which much of the publicity for The King 's Speech is strongly reminiscent .
And cannily so : the folk memory of the king and queen staying in London throughout the war remains the benchmark of respectful popular affection for the house of Windsor .
Of course , 70 years ago there was no question that such affection was conditional on vicarious intimacy with the royals themselves .
Diana and celebrity culture changed all that , and The King 's Speech lets us get to know the private Bertie rather than the public George â€ “ and crucially to feel his pain , to see the emotional struggle behind the stiffest upper lip in history .
Like Helen Mirren 's Elizabeth , not to mention Diana 's entire public life , Firth 's Bertie opens up an imaginative space in which royalty is something that happens to human beings .
However successful such enterprises might be in fostering good feeling , they do not , of course , offer actual access to the royals .
Applause is how the faceless crowd communicates with them .
When it applauded George VI after his speech at the outbreak of war , it was confirming they had struck the right tone .
When it applauded Earl Spencer 's eulogy for his sister in 1997 , it was telling them they had n't .
What does the applause for The King 's Speech signify ?
Perhaps you 've heard it yourself and have an idea .
I wonder if it expresses an appetite for leadership â€ “ for a figurehead able to convince us that he or she is a sympathetic human being who feels our pain and will offer principled guidance in times of adversity .
Take this alongside the extraordinary popular excitement that the engagement of Prince William and Kate Middleton is already generating and you 'd be excused for thinking the Windsor PR machine is looking at an open goal .
It is presumably aware of the potency of the memory of the royals in times of hardship and austerity .
( Is it coincidence that the Royal Collection referred to "" austere times "" in its announcement that it would absorb the VAT rise on wedding memorabilia ? )
The current climate seems to have stoked affection rather than resentment towards the royals â€ “ perhaps because they offer reassuring consistency at a time of upheaval , when the government is disappointing even its own supporters and the opposition is all but invisible .
Quite an opportunity , then .
Wills and Kate currently have next to no public identity and a minimal public role .
We have little idea of their personalities â€ “ especially compared to that of Wills 's parents at the same age .
It 's hardly surprising that they have no appetite to cultivate the kind of celebrity persona associated with Diana .
But the response to their engagement suggests huge reservoirs of public interest in the royal family , and the response to The King 's Speech suggests a readiness to root for and salute them if they are seen to be ready to do their duty as national figureheads , willing to make sacrifices and able to rally the nation .
If Wills and Kate can convince enough of us they are helping to make people 's lives better ( through charitable work , perhaps ? )
, the royal family might earn itself a generation of ovations ."
2011-01-13,"They are more than 700 years old , and built to pacify the unruly – but the castles of Wales could soon be letting down the drawbridge for thousands of foreign tourists , particularly from Poland , Russia , Italy and Germany if a poll of more than 10,000 potential overseas visitors proves correct .
A combination of Prince William being based in north Wales and what may be an untapped market for the remains of Edward
I 's "" iron ring "" of fortresses is raising prospects of a tourist invasion in an area that currently attracts only a miniscule proportion of visitors to the UK .
The castles surprisingly pipped Buckingham Palace as the most popular place to visit in a survey for tourist body VisitBritain published today .
Third most attractive choice was a night in a Scottish castle followed by catching the sunrise at Stonehenge and watching a Premier League football match .
People in 20 countries were asked choose what they would most like to do if they visited the UK from 18 options including the Glastonbury music festival , looking for the Loch Ness monster or visiting Harry Potter film locations .
Prince Charles was invested as Prince of Wales at Caernarfon castle in 1969 , but tourism officials were amazed the castles trumped other attractions "" despite the fact that knowledge of what Wales has to offer is relatively limited around the world "" .
Foreign visitors were twice as keen on them than Brits offered the same menu for a staycation , 34 % to 17 % .
The research was conducted before Prince William and Kate Middleton announced plans to we d in Westminster Abbey in April , but overseas media had already started to introduce audiences to Anglesey , where the newly marrieds will live because of William 's RAF posting .
North Wales , home to most castles , attracts about 290,000 overseas visitors a year , 1 % of the UK total .
Most keen on the medieval fortifications were Poles ( 49 % ) , Russians ( 48 % ) , Italians ( 46 % ) and Germans ( 44 % ) .
Least interested were South Koreans ( 8 % ) and Swedes ( 25 % ) .
But Swedes loved the idea of Scottish castles , perhaps because they were also most taken by a trip round a whisky distillery .
Russians might have murdered their last monarch but were most attracted by Buckingham Palace , beating Japanese , Chinese , Polish and Indian respondents .
They were also top Stonehenge lovers .
Egyptians favoured a football match and going to Harrods , while sharing with Brazilians the most liking for a spell on the ice rink outside London 's Natural History Museum ."
2011-01-16,"St James 's Palace feared that the Prince of Wales would be attacked by members of the public on the way to Diana 's funeral in September 1997 unless his sons accompanied him as he walked behind her coffin , Alastair Campbell writes in his diaries serialised in the Guardian .
In one of the most detailed accounts of events following the death of Diana , Princess of Wales , Campbell says a senior official was despatched from St James 's Palace to Balmoral to warn Prince William .
The fears about Prince Charles 's safety appear in today 's final extracts from Power and the People – which also disclose that : • William had a "" total hatred "" of the media after the relentless press harassment of his mother .
•
Tony Blair believed Charles briefed against Downing Street on other matters in the years after the funeral .
Campbell writes : "" TB felt his relationship with the Queen was good , but he felt Charles had people spreading stuff against us a fair bit of the time . ""
•
Amid a public backlash against the royal family , who were criticised for an unfeeling response to the death of Diana , Blair advised the Queen to show her vulnerable side .
• Buckingham Palace thought that William Hague , then leader of the Conservative party , was "" pathetic "" after he accused Blair of hijacking Diana 's legacy .
•
Margaret Thatcher warned Blair soon after his election landslide in 1997 that Gordon Brown was "" arrogant and insensitive "" in his treatment of the late Bank of England governor , Eddie George .
•
Campbell admits he was the inspiration for the explosive claim in January 1998 that Gordon Brown had "" psychological flaws "" .
Blair complained to Campbell that the problem with the description , reported by Observer columnist Andrew Rawnsley , was that it amounted to the brutal truth .
•
Peter Mandelson 's memoirs , published last year , were an "" insufferably self - indulgent account "" .
Fresh details about the turbulent week after the death of Diana dominate the final extracts of Campbell 's diaries .
Blair 's former communications director writes that fears for the Prince of Wales 's safety became clear during a conference call on 4 September 1997 with courtiers who were with the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh at Balmoral .
These included Sandy Henney , then press secretary to the Prince of Wales , who was sent to Balmoral to advise Prince William that his mother would have wanted him to follow her coffin .
Campbell writes : "" Sandy Henney had been sent up to try to explain why he might do it .
She [ Henney ] was obviously saying it was what his mother would have wanted whilst there was also the fact it would avoid the risk of Charles being publicly attacked . ""
The conference call involved Sir Robin Janvrin , then the Queen 's deputy private secretary , who was with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at Balmoral .
Campbell was at Buckingham Palace with Sir Robert Fellowes , the Queen 's private secretary .
Campbell writes that the courtiers were divided as to whether the Prince of Wales should walk behind the coffin with his two sons . ""
Robin said if William did not do it then Charles could n't ' for obvious and understandable reasons ' .
So he was back to proposing cars for the princes but Charles S[pencer ] was against that .
""
They realised that if William does n't go behind the coffin , they have a real problem because Charles would have to go behind the coffin with Charles Spencer .
There is no way he can do this without the boys , he said .
When I said to Fellowes it was possible to sell the idea of the boys going behind by car if they left from Kensington Palace , he said they were just against cars full stop .
He said they had to keep pushing for it . ""
William believed the plan was designed to appeal to the media .
Campbell writes : "" William was refusing to speak to anyone and he was consumed by a total hatred of the media ...
I sensed the boys were holding firm , and they seemed to feel it was being done for the media and the public , not for their mother . ""
Campbell , who listened to Blair 's call with the Queen after the death of Diana , wrote : "" It was the first time I 'd heard him [ TB ] one on one with the Queen and he really did the ma'am stuff pretty well , but was also clear and firm too .
He said he felt she had to show that she was vulnerable and they really were feeling it .
He said : ' I really do feel for you .
There can be nothing more miserable than feeling as you do and having your motives questioned ' .
"" The diaries also include new details of the tensions between Blair and Brown .
Campbell writes that Blair was given an early warning about his chancellor by Margaret Thatcher at their first meeting in Downing Street a few weeks after Labour 's landslide victory .
Thatcher was angered by Brown 's behaviour towards Eddie George , the late governor of the Bank of England .
The bank had been granted independence but stripped of its powers of regulation over the City .
Campbell writes : "" Thatcher had said to TB she thought GB was arrogant and insensitive , that you could not treat a Bank Governor with anything but respect and that was not coming over . ""
The former Downing Street communications director also owns up to being the inspiration behind the claim in 1998 that Brown had "" psychological flaws "" .
Campbell writes that Sue Nye , a senior member of the Brown circle , regarded the comments as a declaration of war . ""
Sue said as far as GB was concerned , this was a deliberate AC / Peter M[andelson ] operation , authorised by TB and it was therefore ' war ' , "" Campbell writes . ""
Sue said the ' psychological flaw ' headline was like a bullet . ""
Blair complained because Campbell had delivered a home truth . ""
TB said the problem with ' psychological flaws ' was its brutal truth , which is why it hurt him so much .
Then he said ' But I 'm worried , Ali . '
He was the one person who called me Ali when he was being serious . """

They are giggling and swooning and as each woman takes her turn to slip her finger through the replica of Kate Middleton 's gargantuan sapphire - and - diamond ring , her face lights up .
Just 10 minutes earlier , the artist Jennifer Rubell had talked about how there is "" a magical quality , it 's emotional "" , when people do this .

Rubell created this piece , Engagement , after seeing photographs of the couple at their announcement .
"" I had this fantasy : ' What would it be like to get engaged to a prince ? '
It 's like a fairytale .
The piece started to evolve from there , with the ring being the point of connection between the viewer and the artwork .
"" Is n't it a bit anti - feminist , the idea that happiness lies in marrying a prince ? ""

2011-02-11,"The yes campaign in the referendum on introducing the alternative vote for Westminster elections is planning to capitalise on the royal wedding , six days earlier , by arguing that it is "" a time to be optimistic and say yes "" .
Campaigners for change have been struggling with the impact of Prince William 's wedding to Kate Middleton on 29 April , before the referendum on 5 May. That week also includes a bank holiday .
But now they think they have a solution : proclaim it the season for saying yes .
"" We will put all the arguments , but around the wedding it will be a coming - into - summer , more optimistic , more of a yes mood , "" a campaign source said .
"" The no camp will throw everything at us â€ “ that is the nature of a no campaign , it will be ' if in doubt vote no ' . ""
Both campaigns recognise media obsession with the wedding will leave them struggling to capture voters ' attention .
Some estimates suggest turnout will be as low as 35 % .
A spokesman for the yes campaign last night said it would not seek to exploit the royal wedding in any way .
A spokesman for the no campaign said : "" We 're amazed at the yes to
AV campaign 's clumsy attempt to politicise the royal wedding .
"" Most people will be looking forward to a couple of days of not being assaulted by politics .
The yes campaign have to realise the world does not revolve around them and their campaign . ""
The referendum will ask voters whether they want to change from a first - past - the - post system to one where candidates are marked in order of preference .
Yes campaigners say it is a modest but important upgrade of our electoral system that will make MPs more accountable and hard- working and end the damaging culture of safe seats .
Private polling undertaken for the yes campaign by ICM in November showed 59%-41 % support for AV among those expressing an intention to vote .
The poll covered nearly 8,500 people , one of the largest in Britain , and showed support strong across all age groups except those aged over 65 .
Support was strongest among AB higher income voters .
A YouGov tracker poll this week saw the two camps neck and neck : 39 % said they would vote to keep FPTP , and 38 % would vote to switch to AV .
Last September , YouGov was showing a consistent lead for the no campaign as large as nine points .
The decline in the no vote may reflect the recent slide in the Conservatives ' poll rating within the coalition .
It is expected that Nick Clegg and David Cameron will set out the respective cases for and against AV very soon after the bill introducing the referendum gains royal assent , probably next Wednesday .
Cameron and the Conservatives want to keep FPTP , but Clegg and the Liberal Democrats will back AV .
The two men are trying to ensure that the contest does not fracture the coalition .
Faced by four substantial amendments to the bill imposed by peers , Clegg has cancelled a planned visit to South America next week to ensure the bill reaches the statute book by the Wednesday deadline ."
2011-02-11,"With Britain mired in economic gloom , the announcement of the engagement of Prince William and Kate Middleton promised a glimmer of hope .
Foreign visitors would pour in , ran the government 's theory , and David Cameron endorsed a Â£50 m plan to use the event to sell Britain "" as the perfect tourist destination "" alongside the Queen 's diamond jubilee and the London Olympics in 2012 .
But far from the event being a guaranteed money - spinner , a senior tourism official has privately warned that the evidence points to foreign visitors steering clear of the UK around the 29 April wedding .
Internal correspondence obtained from Visit Britain , the government 's tourism agency , has revealed that visitor numbers are expected to fall despite official claims that it would deliver "" an enormous boost for the British tourism industry "" .
Sandie Dawe , Visit Britain 's chief executive , promised that the royal wedding would deliver "" a welcome boost not just to the tourism industry in London , but across Britain "" .
It would create a "" halo effect "" that would carry over into 2012 .
"" Britain 's monarch generates well over Â£500 m a year directly and indirectly from overseas tourists , but the benefit of a royal wedding is likely to outstrip that . ""
But two days after the engagement was announced , Visit Britain 's head of research and forecasting , David Edwards , emailed colleagues with what he described as "" more actual ' evidence ' "" .
"" If we look at the marriage of Andrew and Sarah in July 1986 we find that across the year as a whole there were 4 % fewer visitors to Britain than in 1985 , but that in July [ 1986 ] there were 8 % fewer than in July of 1985 , "" he said .
"" While this and the results relating to 1981 are inconclusive , such as it is , the evidence points to royal weddings having a negative impact on inbound tourism . ""
Foreign visits in July 1981 , when Charles and Diana married , were down 15 % on the average for the same period from 1980 to 1985 , according to the Office for National Statistics .
The alternative internal view emerged from emails obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by Republic , the campaign for a directly elected head of state .
The group is concerned that Visit Britain , a non - departmental public body funded by the Department for Culture , Media and Sport , has made unsubstantiated claims .
Amid deep public spending cuts , the government is under pressure to justify wedding expenses which include a security bill likely to run into tens of millions of pounds .
Ivan Lewis , the shadow culture secretary , accused Cameron of trying to exploit the wedding for political gain by predicting a boom for the struggling tourism sector . ""
He is fully aware of the evidence that demonstrates this event is likely to have the opposite effect on the UK tourist industry , "" said Lewis .
Asked about the apparent discrepancy between its public statements and the internal advice , Visit Britain said it believed the biggest effect would come in the longer term , with more visitors planning trips after seeing the wedding on TV .
Dawe said she believed , contrary to the evidence from previous royal nuptials , that London would benefit considerably from visitors for the wedding and there might be some positive effect in other parts of the country .
She said the bulk of new visitors attracted to the UK would not come for months or even years after the wedding . ""
It acts as a showcase for Britain that will turn into visitors in subsequent years , "" she said .
But Republic 's Graham Smith has accused the body of unfounded promotion of the monarchy . ""
Visit Britain is supposed to be an independent and credible tourism body , yet it has apparently flatly contradicted its own internal evidence so it can play along with this fiction that the monarchy â€ “ and specifically the wedding â€ “ is a boost for the tourism industry , "" he said .
Many Britons are already considering leaving the country to make the most of an 11-day break achieved by taking three days ' leave linking the Easter , wedding and May Day public holidays .
Thomson Holidays and Thomas Cook this week reported a 35 % rise in bookings on the same time last year and Ryanair reported a 65 % surge .
Retail analysts remain hopeful that those who stay at home will increase their spending .
Neil Saunders , consulting director of Verdict , has estimated wedding - related merchandise sales could easily top Â£26 m in the UK , while food and grocery retailers could take in an extra Â£360 m .
The British Hospitality Association said that many of the capital 's best hotels are already close to fully booked for the period and are busier than in a normal year , though it is not known how many of those rooms have been taken by the estimated 2,000 guests and their entourages . ""
Tourists might take the view this is not a great time to visit the UK because everything is geared to the wedding , "" said Saunders .
""
If they want to go to London as part of a wider trip they will find prices are elevated .
"" The US department of homeland security has issued a travel alert about the high level of terrorist threat in the UK that is due to stay in place until after the wedding .
Last June 's royal wedding in Sweden , between Crown Princess Victoria and Daniel Westling , failed to spark expected tourist interest .
Three days before the wedding , the director of the city 's five - star Hilton hotel told local radio that bookings were as on a normal June weekend , with the wedding reportedly drawing fewer visitors than the Stockholm marathon .
The Swedish rail company SJ also had to cancel two of three special "" wedding trains "" to Stockholm , owing to a lack of interest .

2011-02-14,"In possibly the least unexpected announcement in advance of April 's royal wedding , Clarence House has announced that Prince Harry is to be the best man at his older brother Prince William 's marriage service and Kate Middleton has asked her younger sister Philippa - known to her family as Pippa - to be her maid of honour .
The couple have also asked young relatives , assorted godchildren and friends ' offspring to be bridesmaids and page boys for the ceremony at Westminster Abbey on 29 April .
They are : Lady Louise Windsor , the seven - year - old daughter of Prince Edward and the Countess of Wessex ; the Hon Margarita Armstrong - Jones , eight , daughter of Viscount and Viscountess Linley ; Grace van Cutsem , three - year - old daughter of Hugh and Rose van Cutsem , friends of the couple ; Eliza Lopes , also three , the Duchess of Cornwall 's granddaughter ; Billy Lowther - Pinkerton , the 10-year - old son of Jamie Lowther - Pinkerton , the former SAS officer who is William and Harry 's private secretary ; and eight - year - old Tom Pettifer , son of William 's former nanny , Tiggy Legge - Bourke .
Grace van Cutsem and Tom Pettifer are godchildren of Prince William .
Bridegrooms in royal weddings traditionally chose a "" supporter "" instead of a best man .
The Prince of Wales chose his brother Prince Andrew to be his supporter when he married Diana at St Paul 's Cathedral in 1981 .
Prince William has opted to call his brother his "" best man "" , rather than a supporter .
Prince Harry had welcomed the couple 's engagement .
In a statement following the announcement , Harry said : "" I am delighted that my brother has popped the question !
It means I get a sister , which I have always wanted .
"" Harry , who is training to fly Apache attack helicopters , will have the role of planning William 's stag do ."
2011-02-16,"The first official overseas tour by Prince William and Kate Middleton following their marriage will be to Canada at the end of June , Clarence House has announced .
As the Queen is Canada 's head of state , the prince is also a prince of the country .
The couple will spend a week crossing from Quebec and Ottawa to Alberta and the Arctic northwest territories .
The itinerary is likely to include the usual set pieces of official banquets , welcoming ceremonies involving guards of honour , and walkabouts .
It is thought the couple will take part in Canada Day celebrations in Ottawa on 1 July .
A spokesman for St James 's Palace said : "" Prince William was pleased to accept an invitation on his and Miss Middleton 's behalf from the government of Canada . ""
Prince William was keen to be able to visit Canada for himself as an adult , and to be able to show his wife a country that is close to his family 's heart . ""
William visited the Commonwealth country in 1998 aged 15 , touring Vancouver with his father the Prince of Wales and brother Prince Harry .
Meanwhile , it is thought that the couple have chosen photographer Hugo Burnand to take their official photographs .
Burnand , who previous sitters have included Michael Jackson , Lucian Freud and Lady Thatcher , took the photographs at Prince Charles 's wedding to Camilla , the Duchess of Cornwall , in 2005 ."
2011-02-23,"Under the drizzling rain in Canton , neighbours came out of their houses to join a traditional street party table – set up to promote a community event .
Launching this year 's Big Lunch , residents of Denton Road will hold their third annual street party and today urged others to do the same .
But a number of street parties in Cardiff are already planned for this year – to celebrate the marriage of Prince William and Kate Middleton on the date of their royal wedding in April .
Big Lunch promoters are hoping the street party vibe will continue throughout Cardiff until June – when residents across the UK will take part in the third event of its kind .
Mandy Fegan , 51 , of Denton Road , has been helping organise the street party since her daughter Sophie , 24 , saw an advert for the Big Lunch on TV .
Sophie , a final year arts student at Edinburgh university , now helps set up the event from afar while Mandy and her husband Clancy are busy leafleting and getting neighbours and businesses involved .
She said : "" Everything kicks off from our house – there 's a little bit of work involved but all the families bring sandwiches or a bowl of food and the local businesses donate prizes for the competitions we have such as the children 's treasure hunt and the window displays .
It shows that if we all put a bit of effort in , it makes it a nicer place to live . ""
Mandy , who has lived on the street for 23 years , said the street party has brought together neighbours as friends – which was crucial in this winter 's heavy snowfall . ""
Community is so important to have – some people in this road have lived here for years .
Doing the lunches has increased community spirit –
we did n't used to know two thirds of the street
but now everybody comes together and neighbours are not afraid to ask to borrow things –
and when the snow was here we were out helping each other . ""
But Mandy is n't deterred by the other street parties taking place in Cardiff – particularly a big street party planned just up the road for Severn Grove in Riverside for the royal wedding .
"" I think it 's a really good idea for any reason really , if it 's something that helps bring the community together .
Sometimes it 's just nice to have good things happen , "" she said .
The Big Lunch is led by the Eden project and funded by the Big Lottery Fund with the aim of getting 61 million people in the UK together at the same time for a few hours of community .
Oswyn Hughes from the Big Lottery Fund launching this year 's event said : "" The aim is to get people together to get to know each other better and a bit of community spirit . ""
Last year there were 80 big lunches in Wales and this will be something that will continue in the future , especially in the time of austerity which we live in
, it 's more important than ever that people come together . ""
Derek Brockway , the BBC Wales weatherman was also out in the rain to support the event –
but he said he hoped the weather would n't be so dismal on the day :
"" I 'm sorry about the rain today , but I can say it will clear up later in the year –
it 's a bit too early to say what the weather will be
but hopefully it will be barbecue weather !
""
The Big Lunch will take place on 5 June and you can find out more on the Big Lunch website here ."
2011-02-24,"Kate Middleton was introduced to the staples of lifelong royal employment when she launched her first boat and undertook her first walkabout .
Aides may have chosen a deliberately low - key venue for her initiation : an RNLI station on Anglesey , north Wales , where she and Prince William live in a secluded rented farmhouse .
But the 2,000-strong crowd gathered in a chill wind at Trearddur Bay for the couple 's first official joint engagement since their wedding was announced , it demonstrated what she can expect as a full - time member of "" The Firm "" .
She smiled ; they cheered .
She sang the Welsh national anthem in Welsh ; they shouted their approval .
She poured champagne on the bow of the new lifeboat Hereford Endeavour ; they cheered .
She shook hands , accepted posies , cards , drawings , framed photographs and numerous congratulations on her forthcoming wedding ; they shivered but continued to clamour for more . ""
She 's fallen into it well , "" said David Frost , on holiday from Bolton with his wife and their six - year - old grandson , Cameron .
All in all , royal advisers will undoubtedly agree , it was a triumph .
In planning Middleton 's induction , aides have been anxious not to repeat past mistakes .
Diana 's introduction to Wales was an arduous three - day official tour on the royal train after her honeymoon , an ordeal which , though she smiled throughout publicly , reduced her to tears in private and pleas to her husband she could not face another crowd .
Charles 's arrival for a nine - week stint at the University of Wales , before his 1969 investiture as prince of Wales at Caernarvon , was greeted with Welsh and Scottish nationalists clamouring for "" home rule "" and waving placards in Welsh reading ""
Go Home Charlie "" .
But Middleton has been living part of each week on the island since William 's stationing at nearby RAF Valley as a search and rescue pilot .
"" She is a local now .
We 've heard she was in Argos the other day , "" said Megan Dixon , 10 , from the Trearddur Bay village , who with her mother Liz , and friend Nathan Morris , 13 , waited for more than four hours for the couple .
"" Is he the ginger prince ? "" inquired Nathan . ""
Oh , no .
I know the one , "" he added .
"" He 's often in the burger bar at Valley . ""
After bidding the crowd "" prynhawn da "" – good afternoon –
William introduced his fiancee in a brief speech as "" someone who is not only about to join the family , but is also about to become an "" Anglesonian "" .
This elicited more cheers , but bemusement for some members of the crowd unfamiliar with the term . ""
No such word , absolutely not , "" insisted Dafydd Thomas , in the crowd .
""
Never heard of it , "" said Kalleen Gulliford , another islander .
"" Mind you , lovely they both sang the anthem in Welsh .
Just lovely .
I said to her ' Croeso i Sir Fon '
[ Welcome to Anglesey ] .
But I do n't think she understood .
She just smiled . ""
It seemed most of the 2,000-strong village had turned out , with the event also attracting veteran royal watchers from all over Britain .
There was Colin Edwards , 70 , a familiar face during Diana 's engagements , who gave Middleton a framed photograph of the late princess with a young William and Harry taken in 1989 , with the boys wearing green short trousers . ""
Oh my goodness .
Look at his knees .
Fantastic , "" said Middleton as Edwards , from Denbighshire , stooped to kiss her hand .
Winning over Wales has long been a major issue for royalty ever since Edward I invested his son as the first British monarchy 's Prince of Wales in 1301 .
Eager to cement the relationship , Middleton , who may on Charles 's accession become Princess of Wales , wore a Welch Fusiliers badge in the designer beret she chose for the occasion .
After watching the launch of the Atlantic 85 lifeboat , supping tea and tucking into bara brith fruitcake supplied by the local Ladies ' Guild , she stopped to show it to the crowd .
Welsh nationalists may refer to Middleton as a "" future Queen of England "" , but the nearest the vast media pack got to any dissent was when local resident Wyn Roberts admitted he did not know the royal couple were coming , and , what 's more he did n't much care .
It 's the start of long journey for Middleton .
William and his fiancee next return to St Andrews University where they met , and where the prince will launch the University 's 600th anniversary appeal .
It was 10 years ago that William arrived as an awkward freshman , awed by the large media presence .
"" I 'm only going to university .
It 's not like I 'm getting married , though that is what it feels like sometimes , "" he said at the time .
Royal walkabouts Walkabouts are the bread and butter of modern royal life , performed to a formula gradually perfected since they were first routinely introduced in the 1970s to allow more of the masses to meet "" The Firm "" .
It is estimated the Queen 's gloved right hand has lightly shaken at least 3 million other hands during her reign .
According to seasoned royal watchers the rules of engagement are : • Walk steadily down line of well - wishers with inscrutable smile in place .
Accept posies , smile for camera phones and initiate small talk .
•
Limit questions to : "" How nice to meet you "" ; "" Have you come far ? "" ; and "" Are those for me ? ""
– ignoring the fact that flowers are unlikely to be for anyone else .
•
Keep exchanges to five seconds – 10 at absolute maximum .
Utter comfortable platitudes that require little or no response then move on .
•
Do .
Take off gloves to press the flesh ( as Diana did ) .
•
Do n't .
Overshadow grumpy hubby by attracting greater crowd adulation than him ( as Diana did ) .
•
By no means encourage "" a conversation "" ."
2011-02-25,"Prince William and his fiancee , Kate Middleton , have returned to the Scottish university where they first met to launch its 600th anniversary celebrations .
The event at the University of St Andrews was the couple 's first official engagement in Scotland and followed a visit on Thursday to Anglesey , north Wales .
Their romance blossomed when they were students there between 2001 and 2005 .
To mark their wedding the university announced it would establish a £ 70,000 scholarship open to applicants of all nationalities .
A flypast by three aircraft from RAF Leuchars and a choir performance helped mark the institution 's 600th anniversary .
Prince William and Middleton met staff and students before unveiling a plaque .
They also viewed the Papal Bull , a historic document issued by Pope Benedict XIII to found the university in the 15th century .
Prince William addressed 600 students and staff as patron of the university 's 600th anniversary appeal .
Later , the couple spent half an hour speaking to members of the public .
Abigail Pearson , a 22-year - old student from Staffordshire said she had offered her best wishes to Middleton for her wedding . ""
She [ Kate ] replied ' Thank you so much , it does feel a little weird coming back here but it is very nice ' , "" she said .
Alice Dow , 75 , who was born in St Andrews , stood for several hours in cold , blustery conditions to see the royal visitors .
She said the town was proud to have a link with them .
In a speech , Louise Richardson , principal and vice - chancellor of St Andrews , said the university wished them "" a life of love , health and happiness together "" ."
2011-03-02,""" Splitting the difference "" is a phrase that in American politics has unfortunate connotations of awkward compromises and dissatisfaction .
But across the ocean , a new generation of royals see it as the way forward , possibly because it is unlikely one learns too much about the mistakes of President Lyndon Johnson on the Eton syllabus .
Throughout their engagement , Prince William and Catherine - the - artist - formerly - known - as - Kate have attempted to , if not quite split the difference , then at least have it halfway both ways : the formal and the informal portrait photos by Mario Testino ; the designer dress at the announcement and the high street dress in the photos ; long - term relationship but girlfriend still remaining as silent as a chattel .
Now we come to the next stage on the happy couple 's path to the bliss of kinda modern marriage , the launch of their website , which is a little reading Hello ! magazine on an iPad :
the vessel is modern but the content is defiantly retro .
If your computer screen has been thirsting for blog updates on the official royal wedding china , it will thirst no more .
Amazingly , more than 3000 have already expressed a Facebook "" Like "" for the opportunity to look at more photos of Kate and Wills standing next to various ships , although it is not clear how many of those likes came from outside the gates of Clarence House .
And speaking of , should one wish to read more about "" Background "" , you will be directed to the frankly adorable Twitter page for Clarence House
which – and there 's no way of putting this respectfully – sounds like the voice of Clarence House 's former resident , the Queen Mother , speaking from beyond the grave : "" Signs of Spring are starting to show in Green Park .
Happy St David 's Day ! ""
a tweet trills .
Truly , we are on the cutting edge here ."
2011-03-03,"I would like to congratulate Royal Strathclyde Blindcraft Industries ( RSBI ) in Glasgow for securing a Â£2 million order from Glasgow City Council and also Glencraft in Aberdeen for making the headlines in one of our national newspapers for the donation of one of their beds to Prince William and his bride - toâ€“be Kate Middleton .
All of the above clearly indicates what can be done if sheltered workshops are given the proper support mechanisms from local authorities and social enterprises , comparing the events of what is happening at the Glasgow RSBI and Edinburgh Blindcraft clearly highlights the gulf in the support levels available through the councils governing these two cities .
RSBI has a superb infrastructure in place which allows them to diversify at the drop of a hat , whilst Blindcraft has lumbered along from one crisis to another with nobody willing to dedicate the time and effort in trying to equal the success that RSBI have richly deserved , there does not seem to be the same political will in the City of Edinburgh Council to make this happen .
The way ahead for these workshops must surely be to work together rather than in opposition , there needs to be a more centralised management structure in place which will allow for procurement on materials , transport , sales etc , more energy must also be invested in Article 19 which allows public organisations to reserve contracts for supported businesses , Community Union have always stressed that there are other alternatives than closure .
If , as expected , Edinburgh Council allow Blindcraft to close after giving employment to disabled people for 218 years then this will bring shame on Scotland 's capital and will only serve in creating a domino effect up and down the country as other local authorities see an opportunity to save money by dumping disabled people on the scrapheap .
With this in mind , We would call on the City of Edinburgh Council to reconsider their decision and to look at viable ways to secure and enhance the future of disabled people employed at Edinburgh Blindcraft .
The council was offered the chance to respond to this guest post but declined .
Fraser Queen is the Community Union branch secretary at BlindCraft in Edinburgh ."
2011-03-03,"The unveiling of the royal wedding website may seem to represent an incursion of modernity into the realm of true , regal love .
But the truth is the launch of a dedicated portal for stoking the coals of hot anticipation of the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton is actually quite old - fashioned in internet terms .
Many of my fellow Americans have been documenting their wedding plans on the web for more than a decade .
The Knot– America 's biggest wedding portal – launched in the late 90s , included a template for personalised wedding websites that many couples took up with enthusiasm .
In 2005 , a couple of Stanford students programmed Wedding Towne , a database that catalogued thousands of them .
Alas , many of the domains are now expired , leaving the fate of top - ranked couple Karla and Mario frustratingly unclear to readers who were once engaged in their engagement .
But then , perhaps that does n't matter : the point of a wedding website is to capture a couple at their best , not to share the often - challenging realities of a marriage .
They exemplify the lack of self - awareness that befalls many engaged couples : the failure to understand that most of us find it a struggle to maintain interest in other people 's love stories unless they are going a bit wrong .
The structure of a wedding website rarely deviates far from The Knot 's classic model .
Multiple tabs lead visitors to detailed information about the bride and groom 's hobbies ( shopping and golf ) , the wedding party ( the bride and the maid of honour really bonded on their spring break trip Cancun ) , and the order of activities on the great day ( ceremony , speeches , dinner , dancing , bride 's uncle hustled off dance floor , flanked by bouncers ) .
Most important of all , however , are the sections about how the couple met and how the proposal was presented .
No excruciating detail of these once most - private moments is spared .
In the years I 've been browsing wedding websites – an occasional guilty pleasure , thanks to the mild frisson of disgust produced by their inherent smugness –
I 've concluded that their main function is not to inform the bride and groom 's nearest and dearest about their romance and the details of the greatest event of their lives , though that 's the purported intent of having your own youandme.com .
If you 're among the intimates of a couple getting married , then chances are , you are already aware of the complexities of their courtship that have been elided from the official version .
Rather , wedding websites make it apparent that many couples feel a need to PR their relationships , to gloss the story for an imagined constituency of distant acquaintances , embittered teenage sweethearts and curious strangers .
Perhaps it 's because , like Will and Kate , these days we 're far more likely to be entering marriage as nearly middle - aged adults with mottled pasts .
Or perhaps it 's because we 've still failed to rise above the belief that for some , marriage remains life 's greatest accomplishment .
Thus , wedding websites have become an important trappings of the kind of elaborate nuptials where not travelling with a horse and carriage is a decision .
They 're another key tool in the project towards the never - stated , but important goal of many modern weddings : for couples to project the public performance of love beyond the confines of people they really care about .
In other words , a not - different aim from the one which the royal wedding seems designed : to persuade us that the cementing of a relationship between a man and a woman who seem nice enough , but who we do n't know , should bring us the kind of joy that will inspire us to take to the streets with our traditional street party bits .
In this respect , our future king and queen are very common people ."
2011-03-08,"The world has had every chance to see photographs of Prince William growing up .
Since the time he was born he has had his picture taken by the most famous photographers in the world .
And now Clarence House has evened the score slightly by the release of five photographs of Kate Middleton , his bride - to - be , as a child , culled from the obscurity of the Middleton family 's picture albums .
The images show the little girl who would grow up to marry the second in line to the throne in the sort of snaps that grace thousands of middle - class books .
There is Kate , in bunches and a stripy pullover , clambering on a rock during a family holiday in the Lake District at the age of three and a half â€ “ the earliest photograph so far published of her â€ “ and four - year - old Kate with her father and younger sister Pippa at the Roman ruins at Jerash in Jordan , where the family lived for two years in the mid-1980s .
A photograph of the little girl as a five - year - old tomboy has also been released , as have two of her 20 years later on her graduation day at St Andrews University in 2005 .
One shows her with her arms round the waist of Prince William , who graduated on the same day .
The pair had shared student accommodation and then houses for two years by that stage , though were only dimly publicly known to be a couple .
Both had graduated with second - class honours : she in history of art , he in geography .
And they had both just heard the vice - chancellor , Dr Brian Lang , tell the assembled graduates : "" You may have met your future husband or wife . """
2011-03-16,"Prince William and his fiancee , Kate Middleton , have asked people wishing to give them wedding presents to donate instead to a fund for 26 charities , many supporting disadvantaged inner - city children .
A statement issued by Clarence House said : "" Having been touched by the goodwill shown them since the announcement of their engagement , Prince William and Miss Middleton have asked that anyone who might wish to give them a wedding gift consider giving instead to a charitable fund . ""
Many of the charities are little known , without existing royal patronage , and undertake excellent work within specific communities .
They are charities that have a particular resonance with Prince William and Miss Middleton and reflect issues in which the couple have been particularly interested in their lives to date .
"" The announcement may stop some of the lavish gifts bestowed on Prince Charles and Princess Diana at their wedding in 1981 , such as a jewel - encrusted dhow from the Emir of Bahrain which ended up being sold by a royal servant to a West End jeweller , and the charities concerned expressed delight at the couple 's gesture .
Michael de Giorgio , chief executive of Greenhouse Schools , which provides sporting activities for London children , said the decision to include the charity on the list represented a royal endorsement : "" The royal couple have shown the level of social entrepreneurism that will be required to tackle the most pressing social problems . ""
Among the charities are Peace Players , which promotes cross - community cohesion by teaching children basketball in Northern Ireland ; Oily Cart , a children 's theatre group working specially with disabled groups ; Into University , which encourages teenagers to apply for higher education ; Beat Bullying ; Combat Stress and Cruse Bereavement Care for the children of military casualties .
Charities working in Australia , New Zealand and Canada will also benefit .
The prince is on his way to New Zealand to meet those involved in the Christchurch earthquake and the Pike River mine disaster last November , before heading to Queensland to visit the site of the January floods there .
The charities are grouped depending on their work and donations can be earmarked for particular groups : changing lives through arts and sport ; children fulfilling their potential ; help and care at home ; support for service personnel and their families ; and conservation for future generations .
Donations can be made through the www.royalweddingcharityfund.org website .
They will be held in a dedicated account by the Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry and grants will be distributed in partnership with the charities to ensure maximum impact .

Victoria 's Albert gave his wife a sapphire brooch in 1840 , to accompany the first white royal wedding .
More recently , royal wedding gifts have tended towards the prosaic .
When the Queen married Prince Philip in November 1947 , at the height of postwar austerity , the gifts included 131 pairs of nylon stockings , 500 cases of tinned pineapples from Queensland , a sewing machine , a bath sponge , and a potato peeler , and a Sèvres dinner service from the French government , which is still in use 63 years later .

2011-03-17,"As if determined to demonstrate that Christchurch had not lost its sense of humour , one well - wisher held aloft a handmade sign as Prince William arrived at the city 's airport on Thursday . ""
Thank you for dropping by , "" it read . ""
Sorry about the mess . ""
A few of the stock cliches were witnessed â€ “ at one point the prince stopped to hold a baby , and later signed a fire officer 's helmet â€ “ but his whistlestop tour of disaster - hit parts of New Zealand and Australia is no normal bunting - and - barbecues royal visit .
Escorted through the central part of New Zealand 's second - biggest city , Prince William said he was stunned to see the damage caused by last month 's magnitude 6.3 earthquake , which killed at least 166 people and paralysed the central business district and many suburbs . ""
The scale of it is unbelievable .
It really does bring it home to you to see a building like that , it 's just so sad , "" he said , looking up at the 26-storey Hotel Grand Chancellor , which remains slumped dramatically towards the earth .
The prince had earlier spent almost an hour talking to rescue workers at the city 's art gallery , repurposed as a makeshift emergency response headquarters .
One worker in the building said the prince 's visit "" definitely lifted spirits "" .
More than three weeks after Christchurch was rocked by its second massive earthquake in five months , morale is under considerable strain .
On Wednesday the New Zealand government and the International Rugby Board confirmed that Christchurch would no longer host its seven allotted games in the Rugby World Cup , because of damage to the stadium and accommodation .
On Thursday afternoon William flew across New Zealand 's South Island to the west coast to meet the families of the 29 men who died in the Pike River mine explosion .
Welcoming the royal at the Miners ' Hall in Shantytown , near Greymouth , the Grey District mayor , Tony Kokshoorn , said : "" We look at you and we know that you , also , have had tragic times in your past . ""
One of those who met Prince William in a private gathering was Kath Monk , mother of one of the miners killed in November 's explosion .
"" We were so touched , to think that William would travel halfway round the world so close to his wedding , "" Monk said .
"" For the people in Christchurch , and likewise for the Pike River families , it 's given us all a lift .
It really did mean a lot . ""
The meeting with the prince was very informal , Monk said .
"" William spoke to every person from all the families .
He seems a very genuine person who shows real compassion .
He spoke briefly about his mother â€ “ how [ bereavement ] felt as a 15-year - old â€ “ he really could relate . ""
And he displayed "" a good sense of humour "" , she added , evidence that "" he 's his mother 's son "" .
The prime minister , John Key , who met the royal in Shantytown , said the visit was "" hugely appreciated by New Zealanders "" .
He welcomed the inclusion of the Christchurch earthquake appeal on the royal wedding charity gift fund , a gesture which "" reflects the couple 's close ties to and affection for New Zealand "" .
The royal visit , which led New Zealand news bulletins , was not , however , welcomed by everyone .
Keri Hulme , patron of the Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand ( Aotearoa is the Maori name for the country ) , said the tour appeared to be a "" designed to enhance politicians ' profiles "" .
The prince probably meant well , said West Coast resident Hulme , who won the 1984 Booker prize for her novel The Bone People , "" but he 's here today and gone by Saturday .
And in the meantime , and for years and years coming , it 's Aotearoa New Zealanders and their friends
( we will not forget the massive outpouring of support from around the world , and we especially are thinking of the Japanese rescue teams at the moment ) who will be the ones slowly rebuilding places . ""
The prince 's presence was an anachronism , she said .
"" We are making our own customs of memorialisation , our own ways of comforting each other .
And the sheer secularity of the archipelago means that older practices become irrelevant .
"" Writing in the Christchurch Press , Vicki Anderson questioned the timing of the memorial service , which is expected to be attended by more than 10,000 people , including Prince William and politicians from New Zealand and Australia , in Christchurch 's Hagley Park on Friday .
The event , Anderson wrote , amounted to "" a grandiose , empty gesture starring so - called VIPs "" .
For locals , she said , "" life is still too raw here for us to have a memorial .
With a memorial comes some form of closure
â€
“
we 're just not in that place yet .
To the rest of New Zealand and visiting dignitaries the earthquake might be old news
but it 's not to us , the ones living through it . ""
She added : "" Looking on the bright side , I guess the homeless , sorry , displaced , will be able to go to Hagley Park to finally get to use a toilet .
Some affected colonials might even get a glimpse of Prince William 's rapidly decreasing hairline . ""
On Saturday William is scheduled to depart for Australia , where he will visit parts of Queensland and Victoria recovering from flooding and cyclones .
He will leave New Zealand with an enhanced vocabulary .
Bob Parker was good enough to explain to the prince the meaning of "" munted "" , a slice of Kiwi slang the mayor has repeatedly used to describe the state of much of Christchurch . ""
It means totally destroyed , which suits with what 's going on around here , "" Parker said ."
2011-03-17,"A diaphanous dress that helped spark Prince William 's interest in his bride - to - be Kate Middleton when they were at university has been sold at auction for £ 65,000 .
The see - through knitted gown , worn by Middleton at a University of St Andrews charity fashion show attended by the prince in 2002 , sold for more than six times the price £ 8,000-£10,000 estimated by Kerry Taylor auctions .
The total price , including 20 % buyer 's premium , was £ 78,000 .
A man at the back of the salesroom in Dulwich , south - east London , who would not give his name , bought it for an individual he would only name as Nick from Jersey Questioned about the buyer , the man said : "" He thinks it 's an iconic piece and is very happy with the purchase . ""
Bidding began at £ 20,000 and within minutes had reached around £ 50,000 .
Fashion graduate Charlotte Todd designed the piece as a skirt , but organisers decided Middleton should wear it as a dress .
As she strutted down the runway , few onlookers could have imagined it was the first and probably last time that they would see the future queen in her underwear .
William paid £ 200 for a front row seat at the charity event and is said to have approached Middleton after the show .
Todd , a textiles graduate of the University of the West of England , who was the seller , said : "" I never imagined as I sat knitting this piece it would be so important . ""
Middleton , the only person to have worn the dress , is expected to walk down the aisle at Westminster Abbey on 29 April wearing something rather more demure .
The auction house , in Dulwich , south - east London , has previously sold dresses belonging to Diana , Princess of Wales and Audrey Hepburn ."
2011-03-17,"I have written a letter to Prince William and Kate Middleton calling on them to remove the king of Bahrain and other vile men from their wedding invitation list .
The king , who has reportedly received a personal invitation to the wedding from the Queen , has violently crushed the pro - democracy movement in his country .
I reminded the couple of this country 's duty to support the oppressed and the democrats over the despots and oppressors , and warned that it would send an "" appalling message to the world were any dictators of the Middle East – royal or otherwise – seen enjoying the hospitality of your family and rubbing shoulders with Hollywood stars and politicians at your wedding "" .
The inclusion of these dictators on a wedding invitation list that excludes democratic leaders from Europe and the US speaks volumes about the world view of the Windsor family .
These are people who favour status over principle and "" royalty "" over legitimacy .
The relationship between our royal family and those of the Middle East has a long history .
It is a very deep and very personal one – as we saw when Prince Charles used his connections with the Qatari princes to pull the plug on the Chelsea barracks developer at the cost of thousands of jobs .
Yet why do they choose these dictators over others ?
The family connections were never so strong with the houses of Saddam Hussein or Hosni Mubarak , yet in practice the differences are only a matter of degrees .
It would seem that if a dictator has the foresight to call himself "" king "" , the Windsor family will seek out his friendship and speak favourably of him in diplomatic circles .
Perhaps this is why the "" royal "" dictators have received a more muted response to their atrocities from the British government .
No doubt if Kim Jong - il of North Korea – a monarchy in all but name – were to crown himself King Jong - il
he too would discover new friends in Clarence House and Buckingham Palace .
He may even get an invitation to Kate and Wills 's big day .
I would ask the Windsors to spare a thought for those protesters who have been shot , arrested , tortured and killed .
Think of the families whose loved ones have gone missing or who have had the lifeless bodies of their brothers and sons returned to them by the savage security services who prop up these so - called royal families .
And my question to the Windsors is a simple one : can you look those people in the eye and justify the invitation you have extended to their oppressors , can you justify your cosy relationships with these brutal men ?
The inclusion of these people on the guest list of the royal wedding sends an appalling message to the world , particularly at this time , and it reflects very badly on the Windsor family .
It shows the sort of principles and priorities the family has and only adds to the long list of reasons why our shabby and nepotistic monarchy should be abolished in favour of an open , accountable and representative republic .

2011-03-18,"With street parties being set up all over Cardiff , a royal wedding coin being produced and Cardiff council lining the Hayes with bunting , you could say the city has gone all out to celebrate the marriage of Prince William and Kate Middleton .
But one Cardiff vintage store is planning to create royal wedding memorabilia with a twist to mark the big day .
Milkwood Gallery on Lochaber Street in Roath , which stocks commemorative china from previous royal weddings through the ages , will sell souvenir Wills and Kate tea sets ahead of 29 April .
But while memorabilia manufacturer 's are scrabbling to capitalise on this year 's royal wedding , with some companies getting it shockingly wrong , co - owner of the gallery Gail Howard intends to do something a little more unique for the occasion .
"" We want to do a mug for civil partnerships and maybe an old couple celebrating their 50th anniversary . "" I 'd like to put together a tea set which has William and Kate on it , but also maybe has a few other memorable events for ordinary people . ""
Howard opened Milkwood Gallery with Helen Gubb in 2008 – and the shop sells all sorts of vintage goods including clothes , jewellery , homeware , tea sets and china , as well as artwork and sewing kits .
In Howard 's opinion , the appeal of royal wedding memorabilia is more than just the possibility of it increasing in value – and many people who buy the items are die - hard collectors . ""
For people there 's always the possibility it 's accumulating value , but probably the more important thing is the whole nostalgia which comes with the object .
"" It 's a record of a particular time .
People remember where they were when Kennedy was killed .
I can remember watching Princess Anne getting married on my Auntie 's colour tele –
it 's being able to place yourself in a historical context . ""
Milkwood Gallery has three royal wedding mugs – one commemorating Mary and George 's silver jubilee , made by J&amp;G Meakin , as well as mugs of Prince of Wales and Diana and George and Elizabeth
I 's wedding .
One of the mugs was found at Splott market and another at a charity shop
– there 's also a souvenir handkerchief and a commemorative Charles and Di envelope found in a house clearance .
Howard says she 's had little interest from customers in finding William and Kate Middleton collectables , but is planning on creating something for the occasion , as well as bunting and decorations for the many street parties taking place in the city .
"" I would like to make something for it .
I think people like the street parties and they may not necessarily be into the monarchy –
but it 's more about the community .
It 's exciting and a reason to have a bit of a knees up .
"" You do n't have to be a monarchist to be interested – I 'm quite fascinated by them .
Everyone can relate to them and it 's like a living soap opera .

2011-03-19,"Prince William has visited two towns in far north Queensland devastated by cyclone
Yasi last month .
Hundreds of wellwishers cheered and waved as his Blackhawk helicopter touched down in the small coastal community of Cardwell , 200 km ( 125 miles ) south of Cairns , where many properties are still without roofs .
"" I ca n't believe we watched him grow up and here he is , "" one excited onlooker told local media .
In stifling 30-degree heat and with no hat , the prince shook hands as sweat poured off his brow .
"" I 'm suffering with my English pasty white skin , "" he is reported to have told the crowd .
Inside the Cardwell community hall , the prince had lunch with emergency service personnel and volunteers .
He spent several minutes chatting to 102-year - old Betty Evans as she sat in her wheelchair clutching a card from the Queen for her 100th birthday .
Queensland premier Anna Bligh , who was travelling with Prince William , thanked him for his visit to the state .
"" It 's clear that the prince is a real people person , "" she said .
"" He has plenty of compassion and you ca n't get too much of that here right now .
I 've never seen smiles like this since the cyclone came through . ""
Before the visit , Bligh had said she hoped the occasion would be a signal that Queensland was open for business .
The tourism industry in particular has been hard hit since cyclone
Yasi and January 's devastating floods .
The prince also visited the nearby town of Tully where half the population of 5,000 turned out to greet him .
"" This is a very small town and for a prince to come here and show his concern will give us a tremendous lift , "" said police sergeant Mike Baily .
On Saturday night , Prince William attended an invitation - only dinner in Cairns with community members and volunteers .
On Sunday , he will visit flood - affected areas in south - east Queensland , including Toowoomba and Grantham which were both hit by what police described at the time as an "" inland tsunami "" .
On Monday , he will be in the state of Victoria to visit more flood - affected areas ."

Ms Bennett should also have warned Ms Middleton that her future husband might well be staring unemployment in the face because of budget cuts introduced by his grandmother 's government .
There is the possibility of someone from the top brass reassuring the junior officer in the RAF that it 's safe to go ahead with the wedding as his job is secure .
Ms Middleton should make sure of this as , after all , one day there will be a mortgage to pay if he can convince his bank or building society that he is a good bet with sound prospects .
M John Jones Delabole Cornwall Let 's keep calm over copyright
In "" Internet piracy ' threatening future of UK film industry ' "" ( News ) , you give Â£500 m as the estimated annual losses to the film industry in the UK .
You should ask how this figure was arrived at and if it is supported by independent analyses .
Plenty of credible , independent evidence , which paints a very different picture from industry surveys , is repeatedly ignored in this debate .
This matters .
The media discourse around copyright , when it overstates and mischaracterises the problem , is a contributing factor in the harmful policy mistakes made by our politicians .
Those mistakes include legislating to punish innocent people , creating legal hazard for public Wi - Fi providers , denying people the right to sample , parody or reference the culture around them and the pursuit of unworkable and dangerous web - blocking initiatives .
They add up to a policy environment designed for copyright lobbyists rather than creators , consumers and citizens .

With due respect , he and the others are the ones who not only look stupid , but also appear to be hypocrites eager to kick a man when he is down .
Do these leading human rights organisations really expect anybody to believe that they were unaware of the Duke of York 's dealings with corrupt and dictatorial regimes until now ?
They are right to urge the UK government to promote British business in a manner that is consistent with its stated principles .
But they should let Prince Andrew carry on doing what he does best : holding a mirror up to the British society .
Sylvie Aboa - Bradwell Gillingham , Kent We will protect the arts The suggestions that cuts to arts budgets are ideological , or that there is an attempt to run British theatre as an entirely commercial operation , are completely wrong ( "" Regional theatre cuts attacked by cast of British stars "" , News ) .
With changes we have made to increase the amount of National Lottery money going to the arts , the budget of Arts Council England will reduce by only 11 % over the next four years .
This is a remarkably good settlement in the current economic climate .
This government is wholly committed to arts and culture and I will do everything I can to make sure they do not just survive this difficult period , but continue to thrive .
But protecting arts funding while cutting services in other areas is simply not an option .
In your article , the case is made that we can not rely on an endless supply of good actors and directors with no investment .
Add to that list dancers , singers , musicians , visual artists , writers and poets and that is absolutely correct , which is why we will continue to subsidise and support them to the tune of more than Â£2.2bn over the next four years , down only fractionally from Â£2.3bn over the previous four .

2011-03-24,"Move over Lady Gaga and the Black Eyed Peas .
Prince William and Kate Middleton have announced they will be releasing their wedding vows on iTunes in an unlikely assault on the download charts .
The "" iVows "" , which will be live recorded and made available just hours after the ceremony for as little as 79p , have been tipped by record companies to reach number one .
They will be available as part of an hour - long album of the ceremony set to take place in Westminster Abbey next month .
It will be recorded by classical label Decca and released within six days of the wedding .
Gennaro Castaldo , a spokesman for HMV , said : "" We 're expecting huge demand for what , no doubt , will prove a highly collectable recording and piece of royal memorabilia . ""
If enough people start to download their favourite parts of the service then the royal couple could find themselves at the top of the singles charts as well as reaching number one in the album charts .
That would be unprecedented , but it 's worth watching out for . ""
The album is set to include the full service from the Archbishop of Canterbury interspersed with sermons and music from the London Chamber Orchestra , the Fanfare Team from the Central Band of the RAF and the Abbey 's own choir .
Rumours that Elton John and Paul McCartney would be performing were denied by St James 's Palace .
Decca was also responsible for recording Princess Diana 's wedding to Prince Charles and her funeral , but this is the first time that a royal ceremony will be available for near instantaneous download .
Decca has assured those without internet access that the royal wedding album will also be available on CD , vinyl and cassette .
But proposals to record the wedding in 3D have been turned down by the palace , much to the disappointment of Sky who filmed a mock wedding in 3D using stand - ins earlier this year .
One of the world 's leading classical producers , Anna Barry , will be in charge of the recording . ""
This is a great honour and an enormous responsibility , "" she said .
"" The wedding means so much to millions of people all over the world – we have to capture every note and every nuance perfectly and have the recording ready within minutes of the end of the ceremony . """
2011-03-26,"Radio 1 DJs Fearne Cotton and Edith Bowman will be among the BBC presenters joining Huw Edwards for the corporation 's coverage of the royal wedding across two TV channels and four national radio stations .
Edwards was confirmed last year as the main anchor for BBC1 and BBC News Channel coverage of the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton at Westminster Abbey on 29 April – leaving no room for David Dimbleby , who has fronted the corporation 's coverage of most major state events for more than a decade .
The BBC1 10 pm news presenter will be based at Buckingham Palace , with fellow newsreaders Fiona Bruce and Sophie Raworth also based at key central London locations .
Cotton and Bowman will be part of the BBC team providing coverage from across London , along with sports presenter Jake Humphrey , BBC Breakfast 's Chris Hollins and The One Show 's Alex Jones and Anita Rani .
Royal wedding coverage on Radio 4 will be led by Edward Stourton and James Naughtie , while over on Radio 5 Live Victoria Derbyshire and Richard Bacon will be the main presenters .
Vernon Kay and Scott Mills will be covering the wedding for Radio 1 , with Chris Evans and Ken Bruce performing the same duties for Radio 2 .
Buckingham Palace has ruled out 3D TV coverage of the 29 April event , despite BSkyB going to great lengths to try to persuade the royal family of the possibilities afforded by the new technology .
Sky even filmed a mock wedding with the two leads played by stand - ins at a church in Eastbourne , Sussex , earlier this year , and followed up with a 3D demonstration at the Guards Chapel in Windsor .
However , the palace decided against 3D coverage , largely on logistical grounds , in consultation with the royal couple , William 's private secretary Jamie Lowther - Pinkerton and Westminster Abbey officials .

2011-03-28,"The cul - de - sacs of Kent are set to be Britain 's hottest street party zone during next month 's royal wedding , but if you want to kick back beneath the bunting steer clear of Middlesbrough , Bradford and Hull .
Not a single person in the three northern towns has applied to close down a street to celebrate the nuptials of Prince William and Kate Middleton , while 54 have done so in Kent , according to a survey of applications for street party licences .
The audit , conducted by Republic , the campaign for an elected head of state , provides a snapshot of local enthusiasm for the wedding on 29 April and reveals that a third of local authorities have had no applications from residents at all .
Declining to deck the streets and raise a cream - tea toast to the future king and queen are the residents of Barrow , Bury and Gosport , while even the residents of the Scilly Isles , many of whom are tenants of the Duchy of Cornwall , have so far spurned the opportunity to take to the streets to celebrate the biggest royal wedding since Charles and Diana in 1981 .
There is a distinct north - south divide to Britain 's party plans so far with the five southern councils of Kent , Cambridgeshire , Milton Keynes , South Gloucestershire and Bromley reporting 160 applications between them , while swaths of the north have no applications at all .
Of the northern towns , Scarborough in North Yorkshire is most enthusiastic with 18 applications so far while Lincolnshire county council has had 17 bids .
In London , despite David and Samantha Cameron apparently planning a party in Downing Street , many have greeted the prospect of a royal street bash with a collective shrug .
The boroughs of Waltham Forest and Sutton are planning 14 parties but no licences have been requested in Haringey and the City of London while there is only one application in Islington and four in Harrow .
The patchy levels of enthusiasm revealed by Republic 's freedom of information requests which they made on 14 March was interpreted by its director , Graham Smith , as "" terrible news for the palace press office , who have been desperately trying to whip up enthusiasm for the wedding "" .
He added : "" They predicted thousands of street parties up and down the country , but the reality is that only a tiny minority of zealous monarchists are interested .
Despite the relentless hype the British public just are n't excited by the wedding or the royals . ""
With a couple of weeks still remaining to apply for licences it may be too early to judge and the data only covers 112 councils .
Tracey Murphy , 40 , a part - time accounts assistant who is helping to organise a party for up to 150 locals in her cul - de - sac in Dartford , Kent , confirmed their event was "" more about pulling the community together than the royal wedding "" .
"" We are going to do tea and cakes , barbecue , face - painting for the kids , music and there will be a presentation to Norah , our oldest resident at 93 , "" she said .
"" We thought that would be nice .
We 've bought bunting and royal wedding flags with William and Catherine 's face on them and little waving flags for the kids .
There 's a snooker table , a table tennis table and someone 's gone out and bought a big Jenga . ""
Kay McLoughlin , 43 , a volunteer events co - ordinator from Folkestone
who is helping plan a party for the residents of 30 homes in the Kent town , said she was inspired by her respect for William and was planning to lay on a traditional party .
"" We thought let 's go for it and it will be a real memory for the children in 20 years ' time . """
2011-04-01,"A Greater Manchester town once gripped by Royal street party fever less than a decade ago has received just four requests to hold celebratory community events for Prince William 's forthcoming nuptials .
Bolton held 90 street parties – more than anywhere outside London – to celebrate the his grandmother 's Golden Jubilee in 2002 .
Birmingham was the next city in the street party stakes with 70 events .
In 1977 , for the Queen 's Silver Jubilee , a staggering 427 street parties were held across the borough , which probably represented the height of Bolton 's royal flag waving and groaning trestle tables of sandwiches and fairy cakes .
And there were more than 100 when the prince 's parents , Prince Charles and Diana , married in 1981 .
But the Bolton News revealed that town hall officials say they 've received only four applications this time , and none has - so far - been approved .
It is a picture reflected nationally , with a relatively small number of applications for street parties on April 29 .
Earlier this year , Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced the government had agreed to scrap the usual guidelines for road closures and Transport Secretary Philip Hammond wrote to all councils asking them to use their discretion and ensure that they did not impose unnecessary burdens .
The relaxing of the rules was expected to open the floodgates for applications , with Bolton Council reporting last month it had received a number of inquiries .
But last night , a spokesman for Bolton Council said : "" We have had four applications so far from members of the public wanting to hold street parties for the Royal Wedding .
None of these applications have yet been approved . ""
The Prime Minister is amongst those to have applied for a street party licence , from Westminster City Council .
David Cameron , and his wife Samantha , will both attend the wedding ceremony at Westminster Abbey and a lunchtime reception at Buckingham Palace before returning to Downing Street for a party in front of their famous residence .
There is still time to organise a party and the Department for Communities and Local Government has produced a special guide for organisers .
The guide says that many street parties would not need to be licensed , as long as residents do not intend to sell alcohol or use music to attract people .
It remains to be seen if Bolton 's population will suddenly have a surge in applications for street parties ."
2011-04-01,"What with so much else going on today , you may have missed a potentially significant moment in the history of the kingdom .
No , not the latest defection among courtiers of the dusky despot of Tripoli , nor even Prince William 's upper - class decision not to wear ( is this one actually the Daily Mail 's 1 April spoof ? )
a wedding ring .
What caught my eye was Scotland 's switch to free prescriptions for all its patients , on the very day when England 's rate goes up 20p to £ 7.40 a pop .
Wales and Northern Ireland have already gone free , so the contrast within the British NHS family is now a sharp one .
Does it matter on a day when Julian Glover is exploring separatist Catalonia 's latest spat with the central Spanish power in Madrid and the happily independent Irish are being clobbered ( again ) by the European Union ?
In one sense , no .
If you have a devolved system of government that reflects ancient historic patterns – and Belfast was a self - governing province for most of the 20th century , Scotland a separate kingdom until 1707 – then elected reps are going to make different decisions .
Good .
In time , the rest of us benefit from seeing whether other people 's experiments and choices work better than our own .
For that reason , America 's 50 states are sometimes called laboratories of democracy .
And competition between Europe 's warring states through most of the modern era is widely thought to be a major factor in giving Europe the edge over more homogenous entities such as imperial China .
On the other hand , is it smart to bribe the Scottish middle class with its own money – a consistent feature of Scottish National party policy since it took power in Holyrood in the May 2007 elections ?
And does it help to improve health outcomes in the three Celtic regions ?
With the latest Scottish elections due on 5 May – Scots voters ' chance to weigh up Alex Salmond 's four - year rule and the alternatives – both those questions are more problematical .
In England , as the BBC reminded us this morning , 90 % of scrips are free too because children , the unemployed and the over-60s ( me included ) do n't pay – and they are the ones who take the most pills .
I take five a day to treat hereditary high blood pressure ( hypertension ) and related symptoms .
They work very well .
So far .
But about half the population in England do pay the £ 7.40 for their penicillin – or buy a quarterly or annual pre - paid certificate ( PPC ) for about £ 100 if the sums make sense for them – a policy that raises about £ 400 m a year for the NHS ( did I hear "" pays for 15,000 nurses "" ? ) as well as dampens demand a bit , as pricing policies are designed to do .
This is known as co - payment and exists across an ever - increasing range of public services in most advanced industrial ( do I mean post - industrial ? ) countries .
In Australia , they charge to see the GP .
In some places , patients pay "" hotel charges "" to cover hospital costs .
In Britain , co - payments cover more and more of the cost of higher education instead of letting the taxpayer carry most of the strain .
And , though no one describes it in these terms , all the rackets councils now use to sting motorists are a form of user co - payment , from parking tickets and residents ' permits to aggressive fines for minor breaches of road practice .
You do n't have a car ?
Then you do n't pay .
The Scottish executive – whoops ,
I mean government – has produced all sorts of interesting paperwork to suggest that free scrips contribute to health and wellbeing because they encourage people to go to the doc and get their medicine – better than becoming seriously ill .
I acknowledge that the Celts have got several important health policies right .
The Welsh did not invest in big private finance initiative hospital schemes , opting instead to rely on nearby English ones for the trickier stuff and to combine it with moaning about waiting times and unfairness .
The Scots seem to have a better system for rationing and/or approving medicines more quickly than England 's National Institute for Clinical Excellence ( Nice ) , which Andrew Lansley is currently messing up .
And so on .
But the awkward fact is that England 's unloved NHS targets and its more mixed - market regime does seem to be delivering better results , in both waiting times and outcomes , though I would be delighted to be told otherwise by Scots .
That 's not my point here .
My point is : do free Scots scrips generate more pressure for separatism and , if so , will the pressure come from north or south of the border ?
I do n't claim to have the answer , and never underestimate the wily Salmond .
But the English are in a grumpy mood .
Reading Glover 's piece about growing separatism in Spain 's richest region , the ancient cross - border kingdom of Catalonia , I am troubled by the prospect that Spain might eventually break up .
By extension , I am troubled by the fear that England and Scotland might part company via a similar process because the English are fed up with subsidising Scotland 's none - too - healthy NHS ( it gets more cash per head ) and the Scots reply : "" It 's our oil . ""
Or was .
It 's not that we would all be doomed if it happened .
It 's more the worry that small - state romanticism is fine , but larger - state unity is probably better – in the UK of Spain and in the British UK , too .
It 's OK to disagree , as many do .
But I ca n't help recalling that a major impetus for the union of 1707 was the big Scottish banking crash after the failure of the Darien scheme , a colonial venture which went wrong in Panama .
And even Salmond has had to shelve his independence referendum in the wake of the Irish , Icelandic and , dare I add , RBS and HBOS financial disasters .
Ireland is bleeding again today .
Little Portugal , where I was this week , nice country that it is , suffers too .
Belgium ?
Do n't ask .
But we all live in interesting times ."
2011-04-05,"Prince William 's forthcoming marriage to Kate Middleton is unlikely to be beset by any legal confusion .
But future Windsor weddings could easily be mired in controversy unless there are changes to the law , according to Professor Rebecca Probert from Warwick University , an expert on marriage law .
Probert argues that laws need to be unravelled which , for example , give the royals exemptions that do n't apply to the rest of us , while others saddle the royal family with archaic restrictions that contravene their human rights .
The forthcoming royal wedding seemed a good impetus to convert 10 years of research into a book , The Rights and Wrongs of Royal Marriage : How the Law Has Led to Heartbreak , Farce and Confusion , and Why It Must Be Changed .
Probert points out that , as the law stands , any future heir could succeed to the throne if he or she married a Muslim or a Hindu , but not a Catholic .
And in fact , marrying a scientologist or a Satanist would still put him or her in the clear .
"" There 's nothing stopping them under current legislation , "" she says .
"" The Act of Settlement says only that you drop out of the succession if you marry a Catholic .
Any other religion , it 's fine .
Of course , it 's absurd by 21st century standards .
But it 's a consequence of 18th century law designed to secure a Protestant succession .
It 's ridiculous that it has never been repealed .
"" It 's even more ridiculous , perhaps , when heirs are allowed to cohabit with Catholics or enter into same - sex relationships with them without forfeiting their place in the succession .
Also there is nothing to stop the wife or husband of a royal from converting to Catholicism after the wedding .
The issue of royal consent is just as baffling .
Anyone who can trace his or her ancestry back to George II may require the Queen 's consent before marrying .
Otherwise the marriage could be declared technically void under UK law .
Extensive research in the National Archives has led Probert to conclude that while successive governments have been aware of the "" absurdities "" of royal marriage law , they have done nothing about it .
"" They do n't want to be seen to be legislating during a crisis , such as Princess Margaret 's plan to marry [ the divorcee ] Group Captain Peter Townsend in 1955 .
And when there is n't a crisis , there are always more pressing problems .
"" The issue came to a head , she feels , 50 years on from Princess Margaret being pressed into breaking off her engagement .
The build - up to Prince Charles 's marriage to Camilla Parker - Bowles in 2005 brought about judicial contortions from the Lord Chancellor of the day .
Lord Falconer struggled to balance laws that were forged in the 18th century to bolster the hereditary monarchy with a Human Rights Act passed in 1998 making equality before the law a fundamental principle .
Result : farce . ""
The initial announcement that the civil marriage was to take place at Windsor Castle had to be hastily revised , "" Probert recalls .
"" It was shifted to Windsor Guildhall , which was registered for civil marriages . ""
And why did it have to be a civil ceremony for the man who was first in line to the throne and head of the Church or England ?
Because he was a divorcee , and so was his bride .
Attitudes had changed in 50 years , and the Queen felt able to give the consent to her son 's marriage that she had been advised not to give to her sister 's .
Crucial to the Queen 's decision was Lord Falconer 's judgment that the Human Rights Act meant that nobody , including the Prince of Wales , could be discriminated against on grounds of birth .
"" All we had was a statement in parliament and a decision by the registrar general to grant a certificate of marriage , "" says Probert .
"" The Lord Chancellor never went into detail about how the Act might apply to other members of the royal family .
Can any of them now get married in a civil ceremony ?
And , if they choose to marry in church , do they have to go through the same formalities as everyone else ? ""
Royal privilege , it seems , has hitherto exempted them from certain requirements enshrined in the Marriage Act of 1753 , including the need to get a licence and sign the appropriate parish or civil register .
If Probert has her way , even the Archbishop of Canterbury could face a fine of £ 1,000 if he failed to ensure that this was done .
Why ?
Because claiming rights on the basis of non - discrimination must inevitably mean forfeiting privileges enjoyed since the 18th century , she argues .
"" The time to legislate is now while there is a groundswell of enthusiasm for the forthcoming wedding . ""
But surely the government has more pressing problems to deal with ?
""
Successive governments have been saying that since the 1950s and ducking the issue . ""
But why does it matter ?
"" For the general population , it does n't matter too much these days whether or not their parents are married .
But unmarried royals ca n't pass on titles to their heirs .
So as long as we have a royal family , we need to have clear laws that ensure that their marriages are free from challenge as to whether or not they 're valid . ""

The Royal Collection , which normally deals in exhibitions , has broken new ground by releasing the first royal app , telling the story of nuptials in the monarchy through the ages , or at least since Queen Victoria 's marriage to Prince Albert in 1840 .
The monarchy already has a website for this month 's wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton , not to mention Flickr and Facebook accounts , both introduced last year , a Twitter site launched in 2009 , and the Royal channel , which has been on YouTube since 2007 .
Clearly speaking figuratively , Jemima Rellie , the collection 's director of publishing , said : "" Apps enable us to place works from the Royal Collection in the hands of a worldwide audience . ""
The app , which includes pictures of royal wedding dresses , jewellery and gifts , will be available in eight languages .
It is the first of a royal series , with forthcoming apps to include changing the guard and state banquets ."
2011-04-07,"The prime minister , the home secretary and the mayor of London have all vowed that the ramshackle tented peace encampment yards from Westminster Abbey in Parliament Square will not become a backdrop to the perfect royal wedding tableau in on 29 April .
But the sound and fury emanating from the politicians belies an embarrassing powerlessness , the Guardian can reveal .
Despite numerous legal attempts , no one – from No 10 down – has been able to come up with any legal power to move the ragtag band of peaceniks , campaigners and eccentrics from the pavement between the Houses of Parliament and the abbey , where Prince William and Kate Middleton will marry on 29 April .
As the countdown to the wedding begins , Tory politicians are venting their fury at Scotland Yard , piling the pressure on senior officers to do something .
The mayor of London , Boris Johnson , is understood to have made it clear in private to the Metropolitan police that he does not want anything – not a tin of paint , a placard or a tent flap – to spoil the wedding day .
David Cameron told the Commons that he could not understand why demonstrators were being allowed to sleep in the square , and stressed at prime minister 's question time that he wanted the peace camp removed before the wedding .
The home secretary , Theresa May , even created an amendment to the police reform and social responsibility bill , which outlaws the erection in Parliament Square of "" any tent , or any other structure that is designed , or adapted ... for the purpose of facilitating sleeping or staying in "" .
The legislation is about to enter its second reading in the House of Lords and will not be law in time for the big day .
At Scotland Yard , there have been high - level meetings to scour legislation and identify a clause that would give police the power to act .
Given the level of political pressure , there have been conversations about the possibility of using emergency powers but , after a meeting at the Yard this week , it was concluded that there was nothing the Met could do .
A senior police source said : "" They are putting us under huge pressure , but …
They made the laws and to date there does n't seem to be one we can act on .
If there was we would have done it by now . ""
Hopes had been resting on attempts by the Greater London Authority and Westminster council to remove the inhabitants of the camp , their 14 tents , placards , montage pictures of war victims and two home - made police boxes , by taking action through the courts .
But most protesters have permission to stay on the Parliament Square pavement under a clause in the Serious and Organised Crime Act 2005 .
There is a small chance that the GLA – which is responsible for the grass on Parliament Square – might be able to move two tents pitched on a patch of lawn at the edge of the square next week if an appeal by peace campaigners Brian Haw and Barbara Tucker fails in the high court .
However , all Haw and Tucker need do is move their tents three feet on to the pavement .
Westminster council – which is responsible for the pavement – has more chance of success by arguing in the high court that the peace encampment is an obstruction under the Highways Act .
But the case has is not due in court until 9 May. ""
Unfortunately , we have no grounds to clear the camp away for the royal wedding , and , yes , it looks like they are going to be there on the day , "" said a spokeswoman for Westminster council .
Meanwhile , some inhabitants of the camp – which was first settled 10 years ago when veteran peacenik Haw pitched his tent on the grass of Parliament Square – are making what they see as a generous gesture in a spirit of compromise .
One protester , Maria Gallastegui , has written to Buckingham Palace offering to cover up her placards for the day .
She received a noncommital reply – delivered to her police box .
The Prince of Wales , the letter said , "" appreciated "" her offer and "" careful note has been taken on the points you make "" .
For their part , Cameron , May and Johnson seem unlikely to accept the olive branch .
A Home Office spokesman told the Guardian : "" We are still working with the police and other agencies to address this issue and find a solution to ensure that Parliament Square is in a fit and proper state for the royal wedding . ""
Party
like it 's 1981
Councils are to be given legal advice from the health and safety watchdog that they have no reason to ban royal wedding street parties .
Iain Duncan Smith , the work and pensions secretary , has ordered the Health and Safety Executive to give an immediate ruling that street parties are not a health and safety threat , and will not be liable to legal action .
Duncan Smith took action after the cabinet heard from the communities secretary , Eric Pickles , that some councils may be deterring street parties .
Figures from the Local Government Association reveal there have been 4,000 applications for street parties in England and Wales .
A government source said : "" We are furious that councils may be making it difficult .
Often it emerges that the Health and Safety Executive have done nothing wrong , but we end up with these myths . ""
Grant Shapps , the local government minister , said : "" There is a tendency among some councils to gold - plate everything they do .
We want it to be very clear that street parties are easy to set up . ""
A deadline of 8 April has been set for applications and at present Richmond borough council the London borough of Richmond leads with 64 applications .
London 's boroughs have dealt with 500 applications , and outside the English capital , Bristol 53 and Cardiff 35 .

2011-04-08,"Think of the royals With Prince William and Kate Middleton 's nuptials looming , omens suggest a horse with some connection to the royal wedding might prevail ; Party Politics famously did for the bookies in 1992 , the year of a General Election .
Although Royal Rosa is the most regally monikered horse in the field , Oscar Time is the one the Union Jack - waving Middle Englanders should plump for .
It 's the mount of Sam Waley - Cohen , the amateur jockey credited with getting William and Kate back together after their 2007 split by mischievously inviting both to a party at his family 's mansion , where they got their relationship back on track .
Remember the importance of family Remarkably , when the jockey - bookings were finalised , there were four sets of siblings down to ride in this year 's Grand National .
Sadly the withdrawal of Our Monty means that Ruby Walsh 's sister , Katie , misses out , leaving Paul and Nina Carberry on Backstage and Character Building , Leighton and Paddy Aspell on In Compliance and Chief Dan George , and Robbie and Andrew McNamara on Majestic Concorde and Bluesea Cracker .
And while many would n't dream of betting on a female amateur , the excellent Ms Carberry is bound to attract plenty of support as the only woman in the race .
Stick to the sport
you do know If football is more your bag than racing , you could do worse than put your money on What A Friend , a notoriously stubborn , occasionally temperamental but unquestionably talented steed that shares more than a few personality traits with his owner , Sir Alex Ferguson .
Meanwhile JP McManus , the Manchester United manager 's former - boss - turned - nemesis ( as a result of a row over another racehorse ) , sends out five runners .
The notoriously myopic Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger is n't represented in this year 's line - up , but should he decide to have a bet , would almost certainly back BecauseIcouldntsee .
Go with the grey
The elevation of the former steeplechaser Desert Orchid to national treasure status proves how much everyone loves a pretty grey horse and betting on one has its advantages – especially when you are trying to spot your fancy during the 40-strong field 's death - or - glory cavalry charge towards the first fence .
Four greys will come under starter 's orders this afternoon :
Silver By Nature , Quolibet , Piraya and Character Building .
Silver By Nature is the pick of the quartet , but will be hoping for a splash of overnight rain to provide a bit of cut in the ground to help him become the first grey to win the Grand National since Nicolaus Silver in 1961 .
Have fun with a novelty bet If the prospect of picking the winner proves too daunting , you can always opt for one of the vast range of novelty bets offered by most bookmakers : the country of origin of the winning trainer , number of finishers , number of horses to clear the first fence , a father - son trainer - jockey combination to win , any horse to lead at the elbow and lose and even the number of false starts .
Fans of Wayne Rooney - inspired profanity may be interested to know that Coral is offering 20 - 1 against the winning jockey effing and jeffing into a TV camera after the race ."
2011-04-08,"Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation tried again and again to brush off the News of the World phone - hacking scandal .
It was , executives argued , the work of a "" rogue reporter "" , the jailed former royal editor Clive Goodman ; the Guardian had "" substantially and likely deliberately misled the British public "" when this newspaper first revealed that the scandal went wider than the hacking of a few members of Prince William 's entourage .
But as the scandal unfolded , and more and more evidence seeped out , there came a point when Murdoch had to act .
Yesterday 's admission of liability first became possible when Andy Coulson stepped down as David Cameron 's director of communications – because to do so when he was in post would have triggered an immediate resignation .
It became likely when the Metropolitan police began giving up pages from the notebooks of Glenn Mulcaire , the £ 100,000-a - year private investigator employed by the News of the World , to the growing number of celebrity litigants chasing the newspaper .
But it only became certain when Mr Justice Vos , tiring of the growing number of cases , decided that he would hold a case conference next week .
There are 24 separate lawsuits against the News of the World – from Sienna Miller to former Sky Sports pundit Andy Gray , through to those close to the famous , such as Nicola Phillips , a former assistant to Max Clifford .
So many cases were beginning to clog up the courts and Vos wanted to simplify proceedings so the most important could come to trial in the autumn .
Until now the pace of evidence disclosure has been halting , but last month the police were ordered to stop redacting their copies of Mulcaire 's notebooks , and News Corporation has been ordered to release thousands of internal emails to Miller 's lawyers and those of Sky Andrew , the football agent .
News Corporation insiders said yesterday that its admissions of liability in eight of the cases were actions of "" good faith "" that had taken "" months and months "" to prepare .
The company , too , did not know the entire weight of evidence against it .
Its "" unreserved apology "" and admission that its previous internal inquiries were "" not sufficiently robust "" became necessary once it realised that it was likely to lose if any of the eight cases came to court .
The result is that some cases , perhaps all eight , will not come to court .
There was heavy speculation that Miller , one of the most visible , would settle quickly .
That would avoid a potentially damaging trial in which all sorts of evidence could emerge .
Some of those bringing cases were specifically aiming to get Coulson and Rebekah Brooks , his predecessor as News of the World editor , now chief executive , in the witness box .
They may not succeed – because as the company argues , once it has conceded liability , the only thing left to argue about is the level of damages .
And while it will be necessary for some document disclosure to assess the level of damages , the evidence flying around will be far less than would be necessary if the battle were over establishing guilt .
In short , as a result of the settlements , it is likely that only a fraction of the evidence will now be disclosed in the civil actions .
News Corporation , veterans of many legal battles , can also be confident that the level of payments required will be manageable .
The suggestion that its total legal bills and payouts will reach £ 20 m when the affair is concluded may sound like a substantial bill , but the sum pales against the $ 2.5bn of net profit that Rupert Murdoch 's company achieved last year .
There is not even any prospect of the company 's blockbuster £ 8bn takeover of BSkyB being affected : allies of Jeremy Hunt , the culture secretary ruling on the bid , said yesterday that phone hacking was not a relevant factor . ""
Legally we ca n't consider it , "" said one adviser .
The only matter of debate is whether the takeover affects "" media plurality "" in the UK , not whether it demonstrates that one media organisation can become so powerful that it believes it is acting above the law .
Yesterday , News Corporation refused to concede that any further sacrifices are needed ; Andy Coulson has already resigned twice and one other journalist , former assistant editor ( news ) , Ian Edmondson , has been sacked .
But News of the World chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck , arrested this week , remains an employee and the company would not answer questions as to whether he had been suspended .
News Corp continues , almost certainly , to pay Mulcaire 's legal bills , even though it was his notebooks that led to the apology .
There is , now , only one issue left for News Corporation to worry about : the criminal inquiry headed by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers .
That is something that Murdoch can not control , but after yesterday 's admission , the company has shown , again , that it has begun to close down the crisis , pointing the way to a resolution .
No wonder , then , that James Murdoch – his father 's heir apparent – could confidently say yesterday : "" It shows what we were able to do is really put this problem into a box . """
2011-04-13,"She probably did n't need to do it , but when one is about to marry a chap who will one day become Defender of the Faith , it is probably just as well to tick all the boxes :
Clarence House has announced that Kate Middleton was confirmed last month by the bishop of London into full membership of the Church of England .
Middleton 's confirmation at a private service –
she had already been christened into the CofE as a child – serves to dot the Is and cross the Ts of her allegiance to an institution in which she will inevitably spend a lot of time in coming years , especially when Prince William eventually becomes its supreme governor .
A royal spokesman said : "" Catherine Middleton was confirmed by the bishop of London at a private service at St James 's Palace attended by her family and Prince William .
Miss Middleton , who was already baptised , decided to be confirmed as part of her marriage preparations .
"" It also , perhaps , serves the useful purpose of preventing any unpleasantness in due course over the succession by proving beyond doubt that she does not fall foul of the 1701 Act of Settlement that bars Roman Catholics – though not members of other religions not considered so subversive in the 18th century – from marrying heirs to the throne .
Nevertheless , the move left the Church of England 's own spokesmen scratching their heads about the doctrinal implications .
"" Confirmation is a formal recognition of full membership of the Church of England , but we 're not really a membership organisation , "" said one .
The Rt Rev Richard Chartres , the bishop of London , the cleric closest to the royal family who will preach at the wedding in a fortnight , also confirmed Prince William , in 1997 at St George 's Chapel , Windsor ."
2011-04-13,"Cardiff council has confirmed it has received 52 applications for road closures for royal wedding street parties .
Following the extended closing date for applications last Friday , the council 's highways team said there had been a "" huge demand "" for road closures
â€ “ the council issued strict guidelines for street parties earlier this year which you can find here .
Most of the planned road closures will take place from 12pm-6pm on 29 April when Prince William marries Kate Middleton .
Cardiff has a history of hosting street parties , for the Golden Jubilee in 2002 when there were more than 40 street parties held in the city .
Read this Guardian article about some of the stories behind the street parties taking place in Cardiff this time round .
Cardiff council deputy and executive member for communities , housing and social justice , councillor Judith Woodman , said : "" The royal wedding certainly seems to have ignited the community spirit in Cardiff and I am pleased so many people will be hosting community events that all the family can enjoy .
"" It has been reported that Cardiff is only second to London in terms of the number of street parties being held to celebrate the marriage of Prince William and Kate Middleton .
It 's very fitting that as the capital of Wales , Cardiff should be leading the way in celebrations , given that one day William will be Prince of Wales .
"" We 've been plotting all the street party events we know about on our Cardiff Royal Wedding map â€ “ if you have an event taking place in the city you want to tell us about , do send an email with the details to cardiff.local@guardian.co.uk .

But - wait –
there 's not a sudden upsurge in patriotism in the northern quarter .
It 's an alternative party – with little or no mention of Prince William and Kate Middleton .
Instead , the party has been arranged in the name of ' celebrating the Northern Quarter ' .
Carole Keating , an arts and events manager , came up with the idea of an alternative take on ' the big day ' .

2011-04-16,"Asked to write a song to mark William and Kate 's imminent wedding , Emma - Lee Moss says that her first instinct was to trash the great occasion . ""
Rip it to pieces , "" says Moss , 26 , who , with bandmates including bass player Euan Hinshelwood , performs under the stage name
Emmy the Great .
"" I 'm not anti - royal , but I 'm undecided .
Anyway I hate processions , I hate crowds . ""
Her debut album , First Love , released in 2009 , was full of weird and wonderful stories inspired by the mundane :
American spy dramas , chart radio .
Three minutes on the biggest television event of the year should have been easy , but when she picked up her guitar she could n't quite bring herself to be sneering .
"" You keep thinking , oh God , they are good for tourismâ€ ¦ "" Moss had also just finished work on a new album , due for release later this year , that picked over a planned wedding gone wrong â€ “ her own .
( Her fiance broke off their engagement . )
Moss could n't help feeling sympathetic towards a couple that seemed pretty happy together .
"" I realised the people I really felt for were the Hyacinth Bucket types .
The ones living in the Cotswolds and decking our their gardens with Union Jacks â€ “ feeling bitterly sorry not to be Kate Middleton 's mum . ""
So Moss 's song , "" Mistress England "" , became a lament for mothers â€ “ the ones whose ambitions , however long or deeply held , will finally be thwarted when Kate gets the ring on .
The ones who "" might have hoped they could have celebrated a little closer to the royal family on the big day "" .
The subject has inspired a touching , tender song . ""

He found a Queen/
He chose another .
"" The middle eight conjures distant churchbells , but in the Union Jack - decked garden , "" no celebration here "" .
"" I 'm two years younger than Kate Middleton , "" says Moss .
"" I honestly knew girls who applied to St Andrews to meet him .
Presumably they 're a bit miffed now .
"" Did she ever ponder , perhaps , putting St Andrews on her own Ucas form just in case ?
No , says Moss ...
Hinshelwood interjects to say , drily , that he applied to be Wills 's best friend but did n't hear back .
"" I keep trying to put myself in Kate Middleton 's place , "" says Moss .
"" She did a degree , right , that 's how she met him ?
I have never , ever heard it said what she studied there .

2011-04-16,"Last Sunday , guests at the Selsdon Park hotel in South Croydon must have been surprised to witness a prelude to the royal wedding in which Prince William and Kate Middleton discussed their impending nuptials in song and celebrated their love with a set of nifty dance moves .
Bystanders would have noticed a few details out of place , however .
This was not the real royal couple : it was a pair of Asian stand - ins – one wearing military uniform and a sash , the other resplendent in a replica of Kate 's blue Issa dress – and the whole set - up , with two teams of backing dancers , was reminiscent of a scene from the 1973 Bollywood classic Bobby .
They would have also noticed , in the background , a small film crew led by MJ Delaney , the 24-year - old Londoner who had a viral hit last summer with "" Newport State of Mind "" , an online video spoof which gave Jay - Z 's "" New York State of Mind "" , featuring Alicia Keys , a distinctively Welsh makeover .
Commissioned by the Observer , "" Bollywood Royal Wedding "" is Delaney 's latest work in the aftermath of her wildly successful "" Newport "" film .
"" I wanted to do something romantic and sweet , "" she says during time out from the hectic editing process last week .
"" However you feel about royalty , it 's easy to take the piss out of them .
So it was nice just to bring it back to being about a couple getting married who are happy . ""
Delaney , a self - taught film - maker who started out in fashion journalism before trying her hand at music videos , wanted to challenge herself with an elaborate Bollywood song - and - dance routine , in spite of time limits and budgetary constraints .
"" My producer Will was a bit worried , "" she laughs , "" but the London Bollywood Dance School helped us out and we got really lucky finding actors who were up for it .
I called the lookalike agency and told them , ' I 'd like an Asian Kate Middleton please . '
"" Since "" Newport State of Mind "" hit the internet last July , attracting 2.5 m views in its first two - and - a - half weeks before EMI had it removed from YouTube , Delaney has been "" working at a ridiculous pace , not wanting to turn anything down "" , she says .
"" My life seems like a weird dream at the moment "" .
She remade "" Newport "" for Comic Relief with a cast of Welsh stars including Shakin ' Stevens ; she was invited to do a film for the end of Big Brother ; and has been working with the BBC and production companies such as Big Talk , makers of Shaun of the Dead .
It may lead to bigger things , but right now she really enjoys making bite - size films that grab the attention of an easily distracted online audience .
"" I do n't believe anything I do is ever going to be as big as ' Newport ' , "" she says , "" but I hope people like this new film , Bollywood fans most of all .
"" Delaney will watch the royal wedding with friends in Cornwall .
"" I 'm not obsessed with it

2011-04-17,"David Cameron has played down the prospect of an imminent change in the rules of royal succession amid concerns that constitutional tinkering could spark a fresh campaign in Australia for it to become a republic .
The wedding of Prince William to Catherine Middleton on 29 April has focused attention on the issue .
The deputy prime minister , Nick Clegg , had said he was actively pursuing a plan to scrap the principle that gives preference to male heirs , but the prime minister warned that any progress would be complicated and slow . ""
This has been discussed before and everyone in the frontline of politics agrees that this does need to change and there are conversations ongoing , "" Cameron told the Murnaghan programme on Sky News . ""
But it clearly does take some time , because the Queen is not just queen of the United Kingdom but of many other countries around the world and so changes have to be changes that all countries take on board and put in place and there are discussions with those countries ongoing , but these things , I 'm sure , will take some time .
"" It is understood one particular concern is Australia , where it is thought that any attempt to legislate on the laws of succession would reopen the fierce debate about the abolition of the monarchy .
Cameron 's comments came as some Tories expressed anger that Clegg was being presented as the champion of change on the issue . ""
The idea that Clegg is pressing for this , and that the PM is dragging his heels because he 's not in favour of rights for women , is totally ludicrous , "" said one Tory source .
"" We want change , too , but it 's more complicated than it sounds .
A number of different governments would have to pass new laws and , although in principle that should be straightforward , in practice other governments might say it 's not a priority for them . ""
The issue of primogeniture has occupied UK governments on and off for years , with individual MPs making numerous attempts to steer reforms through parliament .
The most recent came from Labour 's Keith Vaz in January .
At the time , Downing Street acknowledged that elements of the 1701 Act of Succession , which also bars Roman Catholics from succeeding to the throne , were "" discriminatory "" , but said change would be "" difficult and complex "" .
Last month , Prince William was urged by the Labour MP and historian Tristram Hunt to "" subtly show his support "" for the reform campaign .
On Sunday Clegg , who is responsible for constitutional reform within the government , said that most people would see the current accession rules as outdated .
He said : "" My own personal view is that in this day and age , the idea that only a man should ascend to the throne would , I think , strike most people as a little old - fashioned .
And that if Prince William and Catherine Middleton were to have a baby daughter as their first child , I think most people would think it perfectly fair and normal that she would eventually become queen of our country . """
2011-04-18,"With help from Stevie Wonder , George Michael has sent Prince William and Kate Middleton an early wedding present .
This weekend , the singer released a cover of Wonder 's You and I ( We Can Conquer the World ) , recorded to celebrate the royal couple 's nearing nuptials .
"" The idea came to me last week , "" Michael explained on Piers Morgan 's CNN talk show .
Though the 47-year - old does not have the most spotless public record , he was a friend of Princess Diana , William 's late mother , and said : "" I should perhaps express my happiness at this marriage , in a way , publicly "" .
So the singer recorded a version of Wonder 's 1972 classic , releasing it for download on Friday night .
"" I 've had a very busy week , "" he said .
Initially , Michael faced an enormous bill from the song 's rights - holders , who are entitled to money from cover versions .
"" Those * * * * ers at EMI wanted to charge me for every download , "" Michael wrote on Twitter .
"" I 'd like Will and Kate to know I was prepared to do that . ""
But Wonder himself came to Michael 's aid , waiving licence fees "" until way after the wedding "" – and preventing the song from becoming "" the most expensive wedding pressie I ever gave anyone "" .
While fans can download You and I for free , Michael has called on them to donate to Kate and William 's charity fund .
"" I want Will and Kate to know that this is a genuine gift , not a promo exercise , "" he said .
"" It 's a gift that they 'll be able to turn into many , many donations . ""
And yet despite his enthusiasm , Michael will not be attending the royal wedding on 29 April .
"" They should [ be ] surrounded by people they love , "" he said last week , "" not dodgy ex - con pop stars .
"" Michael 's last release was also a charity single , a cover of New Order 's True Faith , for Comic Relief ."

2011-04-19,"Kate Middleton has been granted her own coat of arms in advance of the royal wedding , St James 's Palace has disclosed .
The medieval device which , although not strictly necessary , will give Kate Middleton heraldic parity with her husband - to - be Prince William , accompanies what will be the most hi - tech royal wedding in history , with Twitter feeds , Flickr , blogs and live streaming on the Royal Channel on YouTube all being deployed .
There will even be a video wedding book for wellwishers to submit congratulatory messages , though that will be moderated to weed out any offensive or subversive entries .
The coat of arms , devised by the Middletons with the College of Arms , depicts three acorns and a blue and red background run through with a gold chevron : in technical , archaic French , terms "" per pale azure and gules a chevron or cotised argent between three acorns slipped and leaved or "" .
The acorns – oaks being a common tree in the Berkshire village of Bucklebury where the family lives –
represent the three Middleton children and also strength and England .
Two white chevrons also incorporated in the design stand for hills and mountains in keeping with the family 's outdoor pursuits .
The remaining symbols are esoteric jokes , the sort that perhaps only a medieval herald or Garter King of Arms could fully appreciate : the gold chevron is a pun on Kate Middleton 's mother 's maiden name of Goldsmith and the dividing line down the centre an allusion to the Middle - tons .
Kate Middleton 's version is lozenge - shaped and hangs from a blue ribbon – symbols of her unmarried state .
Once she is married the shape will change into a shield and in due course will be impaled into the centre of her husband 's own coat of arms .
Thomas Woodcock , Garter King of Arms , said : "" Every coat of arms has been designed to identify a person , school or organisation and to last for ever .
Heraldry is Europe 's oldest , most visual and strictly regulated form of identity ...
After her marriage Catherine Middleton will place her father 's arms beside those of her husband in what is known as an impaled coat of arms .
This will require a royal warrant from the Queen . ""
In keeping with tradition , next week 's royal wedding will have its own official souvenir programme which will be sold in the streets of London on the morning .
The A5-sized booklet , selling for £ 2 , with proceeds going to the princes ' charitable foundation , will contain the wedding order of service and a message of thanks from the prince and Middleton as well as new official photographs of the couple , taken by Mario Testino .
Only 150,000 copies are being printed but the text will be available to download free online .

2011-04-19,"As royal wedding fever rolls in , we will all be off work to watch Kate Middleton and Prince William 's big day and celebrating with street parties .
Well , not necessarily .
There is no automatic right for employees to take time off work for the additional public holiday on Friday 29 April .
There is often confusion over rights and entitlements to bank holidays , let alone additional days which are not the norm .
The working time regulations state that full - time employees are entitled to a minimum of 28 days paid leave each year .
That includes the usual eight permanent bank holidays .
The governing factor determining whether you are entitled as of right to paid leave on bank holidays , and how many , will come down to your contract of employment ..
Some contracts will state that you will receive 20 days holiday plus all bank holidays , in which case you are entitled to the 29 April as an additional paid days ' leave .
Other contracts will say you are entitled to 28 days holiday including bank holidays , and here you would have no right to take the additional bank holiday as paid leave .
If your employer is maintaining a business as usual approach on the 29 April and you wish to take the day as part of your holiday entitlement , you can request this but your employer does not have to agree if it is not convenient for the business .
This is in line with any request for holiday to be taken at other times during the year .
For those that are working on the royal wedding bank holiday , there is also no statutory entitlement to additional pay .
Again , the position will be governed by the provisions in your contract of employment or any separate agreement reached , so this needs to be checked carefully .
With another additional bank holiday on the horizon next year for the Queen 's diamond jubilee , it is hoped that employers will not be mean spirited .
What they should try and do at the very least is to apply a consistent approach to their employees , especially where the contractual positions regarding holidays may vary between staff .
It is estimated that the extra bank holiday may cost the British economy £ 2.9bn .
The cost to the British economy of a disgruntled and resentful workforce would be significantly higher , however , if employers are overly mean spirited on the day .

2011-04-20,"To the relief of traditionalists , conventional royal wedding etiquette has been restored with the significant announcements that the Queen has now met the Middletons and the prime minister will now be wearing tails to the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton .
Buckingham Palace formally confirmed that the Queen and Prince Philip had hosted Michael and Carole Middleton "" at a private lunch at Windsor Castle today "" .
It is understood to be the first time the Queen , who is official host and in whose name the gold - embossed wedding invitations have been sent , had met the couple .
The fact she had hitherto reportedly "" not yet felt the need "" to meet them raised some eyebrows .
But proper social niceties were observed when the Middletons , self - made millionaires through their party planner mail order business , made the short trip from Bucklebury , Berkshire , to the gathering , described by a discreet source as having enjoyed a "" warm atmosphere "" .
While unlikely to find its way into the official court circular , the meeting had apparently been pencilled in some time ago , thus cocking a royal snook at speculative reports that the couple 's first chance to rub shoulders with the monarch and her consort would be on the wedding day .
Meanwhile , Downing Street announced that David Cameron , in an apparent U - turn , would now be wearing morning dress and not a business suit .
Reports that the prime minister , who eschews formal dress for fear of reviving his privileged Old Etonian image , would wear a plain suit provoked criticism from many quarters .
Bruce Anderson in the Daily Telegraph fulminated that the move could be evidence of "" idleness , contempt for tradition , or merely a lack of self - confidence "" .
But it has emerged that the wedding story has , apparently , all been a misunderstanding – the result of an ill - judged and incorrect briefing to journalists by a No 10 aide .
A picture of the future prime minister in tails , while a member of Oxford University 's Bullingdon Club , was mysteriously withdrawn from public view in 2007 ."

Those desirous of a scientific way of measuring how global William and Kate fever compares with royal weddings past are directed toward that most accurate barometer of earthling opinion : the North Korean postal service .
Strange as it may seem in today 's tetchier world , the People 's Republic released commemorative stamps for the wedding of Charles and Diana in 1981 .
Indeed , to mark the birth of Prince William in 1982 , Kim Il - sung commissioned a set of stamps featuring then state - of - the - art 3D technology .
You know the sort : tilt it to a different angle and the picture changes ; now you see the baby , now you do n't .
As for where they 'd go from that , scratch'n'sniff Wills'n'Kate would seem the logical progression – but it does seem one to phone the North Korean embassy about .
( They 're based in suburban Ealing , somewhat prosaically . )
"" I think you have made a mistake , "" says a chap who , despite affecting to put me through to a press office , appears to be both switchboard operator and communications chief , and may well have proved to be the ambassador himself , had I demanded to speak to his supervisor .
"" You mean to call the South Korean embassy .
"" I most certainly do not .
"" You are saying the People 's Republic produced stamps in 1981 ? "" he demands .
I most certainly am .
A selection are on display in Beijing 's National Postage Stamp Museum , and quite splendid examples they are too .
Now , you do sound a wonderfully obliging chap – could you possibly find out if any William and Kate stamps are in circulation ? ""
No , "" comes the curt reply , and down goes the phone .
Ah well .
Philately will get me nowhere , as Kathy Lette would doubtless observe .

Now that the Queen has had Kate Middleton 's parents to lunch , do let us lay these tired suggestions of unbridgeable social chasms finally to bed .
The families would have had much in common .
After all , it is a fact insufficiently acknowledged that in the great scheme of global blue blood , the Windsors are really rather middle class .
Why , it is far too often left to Princess Michael to point out that the match she made was frightfully déclassé .
Scions of Nazis always marry down , of course , but in the case of Marie - Christine the stoop to we d Prince Michael was compounded by the Windsors ' comparative bourgeoisie , with even the Queen reported to have described her as "" rather grand for us "" .
Thus it fell to Princess Michael to point out that Fergie was "" common "" , and to observe that the decor at Windsor Castle was "" awful "" .
( Having said that , her exquisite candour never eclipsed that of the Queen 's late sister .
It was said that on the way out of a screening of Schindler 's List , Princess Margaret turned to her companion to deliver the stage - whispered verdict : "" Oh those fucking Jews … always moaning . "" )

As billed , today 's edition of our regular feature
Know Your Pundits stars Ingrid Seward , editor of Majesty magazine and a longtime royal expert , who tells the Wall Street Journal that she has averaged a TV appearance a day since the engagement was announced in November ( though that is likely to have increased severalfold by now ) .
The stress has caused Ingrid to take up smoking again , poor luv , but her lung capacity 's loss is a nation 's gain , as the royal subject upon which madam can not be prevailed upon to give a quote has yet to be found .
Here she is on Kate Middleton 's slender frame , about which the tabloids are just managing to restrain themselves until after the wedding , when they can start on the anorexia / compromised fertility plot lines .
"" I heard on the grapevine that her food went back almost untouched , "" Ingrid told the Mirror of a recent private lunch Kate attended .
"" I think she has the desire to eat , but when it physically comes to it she ca n't . ""
And with that , Ingrid proves herself as respected a lay clinician as she is a social analyst .
Long may she rain this stuff over us .

Of course , the rise of citizen journalism means it would be wrong to limit our celebration of punditry to above - the - line names –
so let 's hereby institute the search for the royal wedding 's most idiotic online commenter .
To get the ball rolling , this column would like to spotlight the work of one Varadha V of New Jersey .
Varadha is sufficiently exercised to lay the following gem at the foot of a Daily Mail article mentioning that Jerry Seinfeld – what the hell has he ever done , compared with Wills and Kate ?
– referred to the wedding as "" dress - up "" . ""
Disgraceful comments from a TV actor whose show and stand - up comedy were the prime reasons many Americans moved away from primetime TV en masse .
And the ones who liked his show are the ones who made Charlie Sheen , Lady Gaga , LeBron James and their elk popular .
"" Congratulations , Varadha !
You win a brace of elk and the chance to compete at the stupidity nationals .
Nominations for your fellow competitors are hereby solicited .

2011-04-22,"I am a republican , so I 'm unimpressed by all this royal wedding hoop - la that has suddenly erupted in the pages of national newspapers .
But I read it , as I must , and I came across a very odd contention in Jan Moir 's piece in today 's Daily Mail .
Musing on Kate Middleton 's final days as "" a commoner "" facing "" a new dawn of royal reality ; the starchy hierarchy , the endless protocols , the inevitable rules and restraint , "" Moir wrote : "" So perhaps it is to the Middleton family 's great credit that they have raised a daughter prepared to be quite so selfless , to take on such a damaged and difficult husband ; a man laden with the baggage of history through no fault of his own . ""
Damaged ?
Difficult ?
How does she know ?
What evidence does she have for such claims about Prince William ?
This is facile psychological speculation presented as fact .
There was more .
The prince "" often seems unfathomable , even tetchy , "" she wrote .
Well , his tetchiness with the press is surely understandable - and this is just the kind of article to raise his hackles still higher . ""
Unfathomable "" may be fair enough .
But damaged ?
That , surely , is a very unfair description and , arguably , actionable ."
2011-04-23,"Many of the 1,900 invited guests at Friday 's wedding are unlikely to enjoy much of a better view than the billions watching on television around the world , it hasemerged .
In a seating plan released by Clarence House , it was revealed that Prince William and Kate Middleton 's nearest and dearest will witness the ceremony close up , but those further away will rely on video screens .
The couple are said to have chosen Westminster Abbey because of the way its layout confers intimacy .
Only around half of the guests will sit in front of the quire , a partition that restricts the view of the altar to anyone behind it in the nave , giving it the feel of a large parish church .
In a break with tradition , William and Kate have eschewed having a bride 's side and a groom 's side on the big day .
Members of the Spencer family will sit behind the Middleton family and their friends .
The couple 's friends will be seated together in the north transept and the north and south stalls .
The Queen and other members of the royal family will sit in the south lantern across the aisle from the Middleton family .
In the front row , in order , will be the Queen , the Duke of Edinburgh , the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall , with a seat reserved for Prince Harry once he has completed his best man duties .
Carole Middleton , the bride 's mother , will be directly opposite the Queen , seated next to her husband Michael , then her son James .
The marriage will be marked by a full peal of bells performed only for important royal or national events .
It was sounded on the day of the Queen Mother 's 100th birthday , 4 August 2000 , and was rung half muffled after her funeral on 9 April 2002 .
The list of celebrity guests is headed by David and Victoria Beckham and Sir Elton John and partner David Furnish as well as Guy Ritchie , film - maker and former partner of singer Madonna .
Mario Testino , the official engagement photographer , and singer Joss Stone , who performed at the Concert
For Diana – a tribute event to the Princess of Wales – will also attend ."
2011-04-23,"The walls of Chrissy 's cafe in Billingsgate fish market are covered with framed photographs of porters of today and yesteryear in their traditional white smocks .
"" There 's Lenny ' Apples ' Appleton , ' Mad ' Dickie Barrett and Micky ' Silver ' Darrell , named because he looks like a silverback gorilla , "" chuckles Brian Holmes , a veteran who has carted fish for the merchants here in east London for 21 years .
There is the odd celebrity face too : Prince William , Charlie Dimmock .
And soon , perhaps , Labour leader Ed Miliband may be given pride of place .
Miliband made an unpublicised visit here just before Christmas .
He wanted to hear about the fish porters ' battle for their livelihoods and community .
The Corporation of London is set to withdraw all trading licences from the 120 porters , a role recognised by the corporation since 1632 : to uphold the ethics of the fish market , work honestly and "" act in fellowship "" with colleagues transporting fish around Billingsgate 's 14-acre site in the early hours for a basic wage of £ 50 a day and a payment of "" bobbin "" – an extra porterage fee of 18p for every stone of fish they carry .
Take away the porters ' licences – "" our badges "" – and they become cheap casual labour , Holmes claims , easily replaced by itinerant labourers willing to work for smaller returns .
The Miliband visit could be described as a trademark Blue Labour event .
The leader of the opposition went to Billingsgate on the advice of Labour peer and academic Lord Glasman , who sees the battle for the porters ' way of life as an example of how cherished institutions should resist the community - splitting effects of market forces or , indeed , "" progressive "" reforms driven by a technocratic state blind to their effects on vulnerable communities .
A source close to Miliband said the Labour leader was moved by what he heard as he munched on a bacon sandwich in Chrissy 's . ""
Ed met a porter who said the proudest day of his life was when he got his badge .
His dad had been a porter and then he got his badge .
We have nothing against people in call centres but I am not sure there would be the same emotion on being given a first telephone headset . ""
He added : "" We need to find ways of building and enhancing meaning to people 's lives .
"" It is this that intrigues Miliband about Blue Labour .
The Butler Room at University College , Oxford is 65 miles west of Billingsgate and its rarefied atmosphere belongs to a different world .
Nevertheless it was under the austere gaze of a portrait of former cabinet secretary Lord Butler that Blue Labour – its colour denoting an instinctively traditionalist , small - c conservative mindset – found its defining themes .
In seminars here and at London Metropolitan University , academics and politicians have come together over the past six months to think through the party 's future .
They decided it needed to involve a re - engagement with Labour 's roots in the co - operatives and mutuals of the late 19th century .
"" The trouble for New Labour by 2009 was that it just had one dimension on progress around liberal economics and it assumed that anyone concerned about destructive elements of modern capitalism was nostalgic or in some sense conservative , "" said MP Jon Cruddas .
"" The Labour party was born out of resistance to the worst forms of capitalism and we need to rediscover these ethics .
Billingsgate .
for example , is about the whole character of the city , of east London . ""
The porters have been part of the character of the country and they are being rode roughshod and destroyed .
Blue Labour is n't a romantic nostalgic thing but we need to stand up to how capitalism commodifies everything . ""
Labour 's leadership – seeking ideas as it reviews 28 policy areas – is certainly engaged .
Dr Marc Stears , a friend of Miliband 's from his days at Corpus Christi , Oxford , said the leader was genuinely excited by the new thinking .
"" There are two things that Ed is interested in .
One is the democratic reinvigoration … local people being engaged in really important local projects .
You know , saving libraries , investing their energies in their kids ' schools , building new swimming pools , coming together to set up youth clubs .
The idea that Labour might reidentify with those democratic , vigorous and local actions speaks directly to Ed 's core values .
"" The other thing is the idea that Labour is about protecting things that people value from the most destructive forces of corporate capitalism .
People have ways of life and institutions that they cherish and sometimes in our rush for economic success we lose sight of those .
"" Miliband is set to make two speeches informed by the ideas of Blue Labour over the summer although insiders insist he is also listening to contributors to a soon - to - be - published Purple Book , written by a group of politicians , including transport spokesman John Woodcock MP , who are said to have closer affiliations to New Labour 's heritage .
But back in Billingsgate , the porters are now waiting to hear their fate .
Should the corporation succeed in its plans , Holmes , 63 , believes it will be the end of his community .
"" I worked in the docks straight out of school like my dad .
That community was ruined and the same will happen here .
"" Our oldest porter is 82 and still works after 68 years in the job .
His son is a porter and his grandson was until recently a porter .
That tradition will just be thrown away . ""
Gazing at the black and white photographs on the wall at Chrissy 's , Holmes adds : "" Maurice Glasman has been a great campaigner for us .
I must admit , some people here think he is a bit eccentric – but you need eccentric people in life , do n't you ? """

2011-04-25,"In 1892 the self - taught poet of the Australian bush , Henry Lawson , wrote a splendidly angry birthday ode to Queen Victoria – "" that cold and selfish woman whom the English call Queen "" .
Lawson wanted Australia to become an independent republic .
Instead , an Australian prime minister is this week travelling to London to attend a royal wedding and to wait upon a possible future Australian head of state . ""
The Prince of Wales is worshipped next ( it is a funny thing ) , "" as Lawson wrote . ""
For he will be the loafer whom the fools will call the king "" .
Like some forgotten space probe still journeying on a steady course decades after the mother ship surrendered contact , the empire lingers in the form of an imperial monarchy .
Sixteen independent nations share the Queen as their head of state , along with a handful of dependent territories – and though this wedding is being treated in this country as a British affair , the monarchy still has a role in countries that no longer think of themselves as British at all .
It can no longer justify itself as the embodiment of a shared endeavour sent from London ; only an accident of history whose removal would cause more trouble than its retention .
A remote monarchy from a diminished European power is no sort of threat to countries that are in all other regards properly independent .
But the old ties remain , as the coalition was reminded the other day , when the Lib Dems floated the idea of changing the rules of succession so that a Catholic or a women would have an equal shot at the throne ( provided their parents are the right ones ) .
This is a good proposal but not Britain 's to make , since under the Statute of Westminster all Commonwealth realms must agree .
The monarchy is not quite ours – but certainly not theirs either .
It is a ghostly afterthought of imperial Britain .
The British , to the extent that they think about such things at all , tend to imagine the remaining possessions of the House of Windsor are full of republican indignation .
But 22 million Australians seem not to care very much , the broad sense that the country will one day become a republic only matched by a common reluctance to do anything precipitate about it .
In this , attitudes are not entirely removed from those here .
As ICM reports for the Guardian today , this country likes the monarchy for the moment but does not expect it will be around in 100 years .
More people are pleased by the extra day off than plan to watch the wedding on television .
Of course most Australians think the continuing tie to crown is odd at best , a relic of an age when the Queen visited to declare the country a triumph of British civilisation and Queensland was able to send 500 tins of pineapple to London as a royal wedding present , and no one laughed .
But these days Australia 's republicans seem angry and a bit dated too , and lost a national vote in 1999 .
Tom Keneally 's splendidly furious book , Memoirs from a Young Republic , was published in 1991 and its prediction that the country would be a republic within a decade has come to nothing .
Indeed , when news arrived in Canberra of the latest royal engagement , Australia 's politicians leapt to congratulate what the leader of the opposition – or , as he likes to stress , "" Her Majesty 's loyal opposition "" – called "" our future king "" .
While the Queen remains alive Australia is now no more likely to reject the monarchy than the Pacific microstate of Tuvalu , where in 1982 the Queen and Prince Philip were carried down a dirt track on a flower - strewn litter and only 679 people voted for a republic in a recent referendum ( 1,260 voted against ) .
I doubt if Funafuti , Tuvalu 's Pacific atoll come national capital , will be on many British minds this Friday , when the country 's likely future king and queen get married .
But in a sense William and Kate are about to become Tuvaluans , too .
The wedding will test invisible ties with Commonwealth realms that both sides have all but forgotten exist .
Many predictions have been made in Britain about William and Kate 's ability ( or otherwise ) to renew the monarchy here , but the task , if they chose to take it , is more pressing abroad .
The inevitable pressure in most places will be to end royal ties once the Queen dies – and as an Australian as well as a British citizen , that is what I would favour .
Prince Charles has shown a droopy lack of originality in engaging with places where his mother 's death would automatically make him king .
Will there be a chance of the new royal couple demonstrating that there is an unexpected future for the imperial crown ?
When , visiting Australia this year , William played water polo in budgie smugglers ( tight swimming trunks ) , the nation swooned .
"" Why has a pampered pommy prince won our affection ? "" asked one columnist – but it will take more than celebrity interest to prove that the monarchy in Australia can regenerate .
During the Queen 's quite extraordinarily long reign , it has been possible to do nothing .
But there has been little consideration – unless very privately – of what will happen when she dies .
The Queen 's children have seemed aloof from her other realms , as if the Commonwealth would always tick along in flag - waving Technicolor , a succession of endless royals and royal tours .
Perhaps they have already decided that there is no future for the monarchy outside Britain and are just waiting for the end .
But it could be a long wait .
It may be hard to imagine that somewhere like Canada , whose prime minister is not even coming to London this week , will welcome the prospect of playing a bit part at a future London coronation ; but as republicans have found in Britain , constitutional change is easier to approve of in theory than in action .
What could be the trigger ?
The arrival of King Charles III might do it : but this a slow and strange sort of revolution , and it 's possible to imagine the coronation coming , and going , and the moment being missed as everyone decides to carry on as we are for the time being .
As we shall , after Friday .
The wedding may seem to be about the future , but the future is always imponderable .
The past is a fact , and our monarchy 's imperial past carries with it a heavier momentum than we may think ."
2011-04-26,"A poem about the royal marriage , Like gilt upon a royal carriage , Can add some shine to the occasion
And maybe through its sly persuasion Relieve republicans of doubt , So they do n't spoil the fun day out .

And so , it seems , it falls to me ,
For rather less than half her fee
In rhyme robust and metre supple To toast the royal wedding couple .
I 'll grab a pen , put Radio 4 on , Then Duffy - like ( not that one , moron )
I 'll wait for royal inspiration To strike me , at which time I 'll write , A poem well - versed and bold and tight .
I mean , just how hard can it be ?
If Duffy can do it , so can me .
* Future princess , common Kate ; As common as the common skate , Which is to say , quite rare these days , Unlike their cousins , manta rays .
So Kate 's like skates : rare , though without The rhombic shape and pointed snout , Or ventral gills or dorsal fin , Or , one presumes , the prickly skin ( Frankly not sure where this heading , Or what it 's got to do with wedding â€
“
I 'll close it out with one more rhyme , And start again , with Will this time . )
* Royal William , royal as jelly ; Mates with what's - his - name , Guy Pelly .
Royal as icing , royal as blue .
Royal enough , let 's hope , for two .
For he will take this Eastertide , A common girl to be his bride .
Lovely Kate , despite the fuss , Is really just like one of us , Though slightly better situated , Better dressed and educated , With better manners , nicer hair , More expensive dental care .
* But look beyond the straight white teeth , What 's important lies beneath .
The role itself may not be vital ( Indeed , the job 's not worth the title ) ,
But when Queen Kate is so created The rest of us are elevated ; And royals , in our common eyes Look less impressive , regal , wise .
Could royalty become extinct
Once commoner and royal are linked ?
The monarchy â€ “ destroyed by Kate , Like overfishing killed those skate .
*
Yes , my reasoning is simplistic , Daft , far - fetched and optimistic .
Forget about it
â€
“
let 's not quibble .
Hang some bunting ; have a nibble !
Let 's put our politics away , And just enjoy the magic day .
For first and foremost , it 's a wedding â€ “ Boy from Windsor , girl from Reading â€
“ Imagine you 're an honoured guest , Wish two crazy kids the best , Line the route and pray it 's sunny .
God bless this waste of public money ."
2011-04-26,"What must it be like to be Prince William of Wales , Knight of the Garter and second in line to the throne of 16 countries ?
As he waits for 40 minutes at Westminster Abbey this Friday for the arrival of his bride â€ “ a pause intended to allow him dutifully to greet the massed ranks of arriving royal families and to have a few moments ' privacy in an antechapel before the ceremony â€ “ the thought that he is also under the remorseless gaze of several hundred million people from Hong Kong to Honolulu will doubtless also bear down heavily upon him .
As his aides say , it is a special day for him and Kate Middleton â€ “ "" a very personal moment "" , as memorable as for any other couple getting married â€ “ but also one that will be shared with a large proportion of the world 's population , stretching way beyond the Commonwealth .
The American networks alone are sending hundreds of staff to provide live coverage through the day .
A religious ceremony , yes , aides say , but also a chance to show potential tourists what Britain is still best at : pomp , ceremony , pageantry and tradition .
A personal event , but one happily also combining commercial , political and constitutional opportunities .
William knows all that .
He has been the focus of intense , intrusive scrutiny all his life â€ “ even before it , actually , as the tabloids could not resist publishing photographs of his five - months pregnant mother , Princess Diana , wearing a bikini on holiday in the Bahamas .
From the moment of his birth at St Mary 's Hospital , Paddington on 21 June 1982 , William Arthur Philip Louis â€ “ a prince from birth and immediately second in the rank of succession
â€
“ has been the centre of fascination and speculation :
what would he look like , what would he be like , who would he marry ?
As his father , Prince Charles , wrote at the time : "" I have never seen such scenes as there were outside the hospital when I left that night
â€ “ everyone had gone berserk with excitement .
"" Since then , every step he has taken has been scrutinised , analysed , dissected for hidden meaning and commented upon , usually by people who have never met him and often have never even seen him in the flesh .
He is the great Known Unknown .
It must be very irksome .
From a public childhood , through a vicious parental breakup as he reached his teens , to the trauma of his mother 's appallingly sudden death and the overwhelmingly public emotion surrounding her funeral â€ “ during which he , as a 15-year - old , had to walk behind her coffin through weeping , febrile , self - righteous crowds â€ “ to his university days , services career and prolonged courtship of Kate Middleton , he has never not been in the spotlight .
In the circumstances , it is a wonder he has turned out as "" normal "" as he has .
There have been no temper tantrums , no documented instances of peevish bad behaviour or shirtiness , no haughtiness or snobbishness , no unguarded utterances , no drug - taking or public drunkenness , no unsuitable girlfriends : precious little , in fact , for the tabloids to get their teeth into .
Had there been , we would certainly have heard about them , read about the revelations of former friends , or the gossip of rancorous palace servants , and seen the pictures spread in glorious technicolour across the pages of the press .
They would certainly have found their way into the pantheon of the royal soap opera : the template of a world of passion and emotion into which the family is supposed to fit and so often has , obligingly , in recent decades .
Instead of which , those who have met him speak privately , as well as publicly , of a decent young man , approachable , genial and serious - minded , able to make conversation and not be stilted about it , committed both to the charities in which he is interested and to his nascent career as an air - sea rescue helicopter pilot , a genuinely useful job .
Aware of his huge privileges certainly , but also the duties they bring .
Ah yes â€ “ duty .
It is something that weighs down his father and which has been drummed into William .
Easy enough to say he could renounce it all and walk away , but that is not how the royal family works
: they see it as their raison d'Ãªtre and what holds them ultimately in place .
It is said that , at age seven , William told his mother he wanted to be a policeman , only for his little brother Harry to perk up with : ""
Oh no , you ca n't â€ “ you 've got to be king . ""
As William said when giving a rare interview on his 21st birthday eight years ago : "" All these questions about do you want to be king ?
It 's not a question of wanting to be , it 's something I was born into and it 's my duty . ""
Patrick Jephson , formerly Princess Diana 's private secretary , says she repeatedly told her son he had been born to fulfil a duty and it would be an opportunity for him to use his influence for the good of those less fortunate than himself .
There is no doubt that his mother remains a hugely formative influence .
She was determined to give him and his brother as normal an upbringing as possible â€ “ hence the trips to McDonald 's and to theme parks and the playing with her valet Paul Burrell 's children .
These were gestures that were highly unusual at the time , given what limited experience of the outside "" ordinary "" world previous princes , including their father Charles , had had .
Diana clearly was a hugely affectionate and protective mother , too , perhaps making up for the neglect she felt from her husband and the isolation of her own childhood .
And there were her own attempts at media training .
As a friend told Diana 's biographer Sarah Bradford : "" William was in the school play .
He was very little , probably three and a half â€ ¦
all dressed up in a little nativity outfit .
And there was this huge bank of photographers all on ladders .
They have even got big coats and woolly hats .
They look like a rabble and they have all got these big cameras .
It 's terrifying anyway , let alone if you are a little tiny boy .
And everyone was shouting out ' William , William , William ! '
It must have been terrifically difficult for a child that age to understand .
"" I asked her once , what do you do about that ?
And she said she had had to say to him : ' You are going to go to school today and there 's going to be all these people who want to take your picture and if you are a good boy and you let them â€ ¦ then I 'll take you to Thorpe Park next week . '
"" Ordinariness had its limits : there could be no state schooling for the boy princes .
Perhaps it is easier to protect such celebrities by tucking them away in a boarding school , such as Eton , used to famous offspring .
At any rate , they were spared the rigours of Gordonstoun , which their father had hated .
It did not protect them from the highly public crash of their parents ' marriage collapse .
William , Bradford says , heard the rows and shouting from outside the door .
He and his brother were ruthlessly used as pawns by both sides in the divorce settlement .
Burrell â€ “ who may or may not be a reliable witness
â€ “ says the Queen told Diana : "" My concern is only that those children have been the battleground of a marriage that has broken down . ""
Perhaps the Queen really does speak like a soap opera matriarch , but the sentiments must have been genuine .
Then there was the ghastly summer of 1997 : the teenaged princes again pawns in their mother 's continuing campaign to assert herself .
The boys were guests of Mohamed Al Fayed on his yacht , specially bought to impress the princess and encourage her relationship with his playboy son Dodi , and were then packed off to Balmoral to go fishing and shooting with their father .
It was he who broke the news to them that their mother had been killed in the Paris car crash .
William said he knew something dreadful had happened because he had kept waking up that night .
They were immediately surrounded by the constipated emotions of the royal family , their father moaning : "" They are all going to blame me , are n't they ? "" , and the hysteria emanating from beyond the palace gates .
There were real fears that the royal family would be attacked at the funeral .
It was the Duke of Edinburgh , usually thought of as a megalith of frosted and unempathetic emotion , who said that if the boys wanted to walk behind their mother 's coffin , he would be beside them . ""
Not a day goes by when I do n't think about [ the crash ] once in the day , "" William said in 2007 .
Last week he took his bride to visit his mother 's grave on an island at Althorp , the Spencer family 's ancestral Northamptonshire estate .
William obtained reasonable A - levels â€ “ A in geography , B in history of art , where he could at least cite the royal collection if he needed examples , and C in biology â€ “ before proceeding to the University of St Andrews to read art history .
It was chosen specifically as a suitably remote location , away from metropolitan distractions , albeit that a chastened media were more respectful of his privacy following the Diana experience .
University was nevertheless something of an ordeal , going out into a slightly less enclosed world , though one with many students of affluent and privileged backgrounds .
He nearly quit and it was another student , Kate Middleton , who persuaded him he would be happier switching subjects , to geography .
The pair discreetly moved in together , sharing first a house in the town with other students and then , again in a foursome , a cottage on a country estate .
In 2005 William graduated with an upper second , the highest degree a British prince has ever attained on merit .
Charles Warren , his geography tutor , says : "" He is a really nice young man .
I warmed to him : he is very natural , understated .
He did not push himself forward .
He was very keen to ensure his presence did not disrupt things .
He was just a regular guy , fitted in brilliantly . ""
Since then William has embarked on the standard military training of a royal prince , in all three services : Sandhurst and a commission in the posh Blues and Royals Household Cavalry regiment for the army ; time with the Navy on HMS Iron Duke , chasing drug smugglers in the Caribbean ; and then pilot training with the RAF and most recently with the helicopter air - sea rescue service off Anglesey .
Some of his colleagues have been invited to the wedding : he mucks in well , they say , a good bloke .
Two weeks ' leave for a honeymoon and then he will be back there .
William has also adopted his mother 's charitable instincts and some of her charities , too , especially those dealing with the damaged and disadvantaged : HIV / Aids clinics , the Royal Marsden hospital and Centrepoint , the homeless charity , as well as the English Schools ' Swimming Association and the Tusk Trust wildlife conservation charity in Africa .
These are not perfunctory duties .
Just before Christmas a year ago , he spent a freezing night sleeping rough near Blackfriars Bridge in London to see what the homeless sometimes endure .
Afterwards , he said : "" I could n't even begin to imagine what it must be like to sleep rough night after night .
"" Easy to sneer â€ “ at least he did it .
Then there is also the football , not normally a royal pursuit .
William has done the hunting , shooting , skiing and polo â€
“
he was also rather good at water polo , representing Scottish Universities â€ “ but football is a real enthusiasm .
Beyond his recherchÃ © support for Aston Villa , his appointment as president of the Football Association ( he is also vice - patron of the Welsh RFU ) and his mobilisation on behalf of England 's failed World Cup bid â€ “ which is where the Beckhams ' wedding invitation originated â€ “ he also still plays .
Only last week a team turning up for a kickabout in Battersea Park were surprised to see him on the other side .
Martin Bruce , a radio producer , said : "" He was really good in the air , a solid header and good at tackling â€ ¦ in the changing room we all thought , did that just happen ?
I did n't want to be the person who accidentally broke his ankle or gave him a black eye just before the wedding . ""
He and Middleton have been partners , with one brief break in 2007 , for the last eight years , living together just as many of their generation do and without the censure from conservative churchmen that might have occurred 20 years ago , even though William will one day be defender of their faith .
He and his bride therefore know each other before their marriage better and more intimately probably than any previous royal partnership .
William has not been hawked round the royal families of Europe or the aristocracy of Britain in search of a bride , as his father was , and has been allowed his own choice of spouse .
That Middleton does not come from such a background is viewed by the less stuffy members of the royal household as a plus .
The couple are also older than their predecessors .
Both are 29 â€
“ William is now only seven years younger than his mother was when she died â€ “ and both have a back story of shared experiences .
They have a close circle of friends from similar backgrounds , carefully scrutinised before being allowed in .
William has said he deliberately plants small , false stories with people he does not yet know
and , if they appear later in the press , knows not to trust them .
He has reason to be suspicious , not only because of his mother 's experience , but as someone whose phone has been hacked .
He certainly enjoys evading and misleading the press , most recently over his stag weekend , which went unobserved until it was over .
In person he is friendly enough , genially joshing royal correspondents in the limited encounters he has with them .
He is proving good with crowds on walkabouts , too : empathetic , informal , sympathetic , conversational .
Even blasÃ © Australians fell under his spell on his first official visit there last year .
"" He may , "" said the Melbourne Age , "" have set back the republican cause decades . ""
Always hovering nearby is his private secretary , Jamie Lowther - Pinkerton , a hatchet - faced former SAS officer who looks as though he would rather be cracking skulls than carrying the bouquets thrust into the prince 's hands on walkabouts .
He and the prince 's other advisers â€ “
David Manning , a former diplomat ; Paddy Harverson and Miguel Head , his press officers â€
“ know how easily a gaffe can occur .
The nearest so far has been a helicopter jaunt a couple of years ago to drop in on Middleton at home with her parents in Bucklebury , Berkshire .
He has n't done anything so silly since .
As he gazes up at the abbey 's medieval tracery while waiting for his bride on Friday , William â€ “ sensitive , reserved , a worrier â€ “ knows that his greatest burdens lie ahead .
The royal family is ageing : his granny , though fit , is 85 ; his dad will inherit the throne as an old man and he himself is fast approaching middle - age .
It needs some gilt on its gingerbread and he will have to provide it .
The next question : when 's a baby coming ?"

2011-04-27,"David Cameron has wished Prince William and Kate Middleton a "" long and happy life together "" ahead of the royal wedding on Friday , which he will attend with his wife , Samantha .
But while the prime minister can look forward to the glamorous event , the decision to exclude his two immediate predecessors , Tony Blair and Gordon Brown , has provoked anger among some Labour MPs , with the royal family accused of causing "" gratuitous offence "" .
Even the rightwing Daily Mail has waded in , devoting two pages and an editorial to the issue .
The Mail – whose editor , Paul Dacre , is seen as a close friend of Brown – declared the decision to withhold invitations from the two recent Labour premiers to be a "" straightforward , calculated snub "" , which it said was out of step with constitutional convention .
Cameron omitted to mention his predecessors being left out in the cold as he told MPs in the Commons on Wednesday that excitement about the event was mounting around the world .
"" People across the country , and indeed across the world , are getting excited about the events on Friday , "" he said .
"" I 'm sure the whole House would wish to join me in sending our best wishes to Prince William and to Catherine Middleton ahead of their wedding , and to wish them a long and happy life together . ""
The Labour leader , Ed Miliband , used his turn at the dispatch box to send his "" best wishes "" to the couple on their "" happy day "" – which he , too , will be attending .
Miliband went on to joke that he hoped he , Cameron and Nick Clegg , who will also attend , "" will all do our best to be suitably attired for the occasion "" .
The jibe was levelled at Cameron after Downing Street initially said the prime minister would shun a tailcoat in favour of his business suit , rumoured to be because of a desire to avoid drawing attention to his privileged background .
It has since being announced that he will wear a full morning suit .
While the leaders worry about what to wear , others have been left reeling by the omission of Blair and Brown from the guest list for the ceremony at Westminster Abbey .
The former Tory prime minister Sir John Major , who served as a formal guardian to princes William and Harry after their mother 's death , is going .
His predecessor , Lady Thatcher , was invited but will not be present because of ill - health , while Blair , who served as premier for 10 years , and Brown , who was his chancellor for a decade before leading the country for three years , were not among the eclectic mix of friends , family , sports stars , personalities and the odd dictator included on the list .
This contrasts with the wedding of Prince Charles , the heir to the throne , and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981 , when all surviving former premiers were invited .
Royal sources told the Mail that William 's wedding was not a full state occasion and there was therefore no reason to invite all former British leaders .
The Labour MP Graham Allen said the decision to omit the last two former premiers was "" insensitive "" and made him wonder what the motive was , while Chris Bryant , Labour 's justice spokesman , told the Mail the same propriety of previous occasions should have been applied .
He said : "" I blame Downing Street for not spotting it and saying : ' We do n't like Gordon either , but he really should be there ' . ""
A St James 's Palace spokesman said that , unlike Blair and Brown , Major and Thatcher are Knights of the Garter , alongside William .
The Mail columnist Stephen Glover said citing the reason that Blair and Brown were not Knights of the Garter did not carry "" any credibility "" .
Glover said it was "" highly regrettable "" to the point of being "" constitutionally irregular "" that the two most recent prime ministers had not been invited while some "" pretty unsavoury "" foreign leaders had .
Despite not being a fan of either man , Glover wrote : "" What conceivable reason could there be for not inviting these former democratic leaders to a wedding which , though not an official state occasion , bears an awfully close relationship to one in its size as well as its splendour ? ""
The Queen has been so adept at remaining impartial above the political fray that it is difficult to believe she vetoed the invitation of these two former leaders out of spite , dislike or political prejudice . ""
Maybe there is some personal animus we do n't know about .
But I very much hope it is some idiotic servant who is to blame . ""
But whatever the explanation , this is a decision that will damage the monarchy more than the feelings of Blair and Brown . ""
Once the crown appears to be taking sides – and that is the impression , if not the intention – our delicate constitutional arrangements are imperilled .
A last - minute invitation to each of them , though unlikely to be accepted , might undo some of the needless harm that has been caused . """
2011-04-27,"•
We begin with security news , specifically the fear that the happy couple 's carriage might have to run the gauntlet of tedious little chaps waving placards like "" Death to those who insult the peace of Islam "" .
Muslims Against Crusades claimed they 're calling off their protest , but did so under a banner reading "" Wanted : Prince William
…
Modern Day Nazi "" – so they may still be in play .
I know what you 're thinking – why do n't these dullards just bore off and enjoy the bank holiday ?
–
but apparently it 's not that simple .
Indeed , in a massive dullard - off , any homicidal pacifists may have to contend with those tedious little chaps from the English Defence League , whose leader Tommy Robinson – the one who runs a tanning salon , if you can picture anything so coeur de lion – has announced that a crack team of his idiots will be risking prosecution to form "" a ring of steel round that wedding "" .
( Tommy himself will be away on his holidays , probably defending England somewhere overseas . )
Ever the victims , the Metropolitan police have declined to rise above such posturing , instead persisting in their brilliant strategy of dividing the entire nation into people who are either for them or against them , as opposed to merely stuck with them .
Thus they appear to have decided that the royal wedding marks the official launch of citizen policing – which is a bit like citizen journalism , but with the ability to park in a disabled bay whilst buying a pasty .
"" We really need you to be our eyes and our ears , "" Assistant Commissioner Lynne Owens implored the nation at an outreach press conference .
"" If you see anything or anyone in the crowd who is acting suspiciously , please bring it to the earliest attention of our officers . ""
Lynne offers no advice on what to do if that person acting suspiciously is a police officer , but the obvious answer would be to bring it to the earliest attention of no one at all .
Furthermore , citizen police who believe that putting in 40 minutes of half - arsed vigilance on the day will entitle them to claim endless overtime then go on the sick for two years are likely to be disappointed .
That concludes your briefing , officers .
And hey – let 's be careful out there .

Once again , the royal wedding presents a chance to assess Where We 're At as a nation , as fifth - tier celebrity mag New quizzes the cast of ITV2 's apocalypse - hastening reality format The Only Way Is Essex about their plans for Friday .

To Australia , that fabled young country , where a TV comedy troupe perceives itself to have been personally insulted by the Queen , Clarence House , and the BBC .
The Chaser team are contracted to the ABC network , and had hoped to layer droll commentary on top of the live BBC coverage being provided to foreign rights holders .
Alas , the fairly standard broadcast agreement forbids this – which senior executives have taken as some kind of international diplomatic insult . ""
Clearly , the BBC and Clarence House have decided The Chaser are n't acceptable , "" fumes ABC director Kim Dalton , rather sweetly imagining that either of the above has the remotest idea who The Chaser are .
As for the Aussie satirists themselves , they say : "" The Chaser team accepts that the ABC has been put in an impossible position by people acting on behalf of the royal family . ""
Well quite –
and it does seem wildly short sighted of the BBC , who seem to have forgotten that the boot will one day be on the other foot .
After all , at some point in the future , tragic Steve Irwin 's daughter Binky is going to get married , and the Beeb has just condemned British viewers to an unleavened four - hour state ceremony from the Crocosseum .
Another spectacular cock - up by the cultural relativism department , all told , and we can only offer Australia our sincerest apologies ."
2011-04-28,"The police and intelligence services have launched an unprecedented security operation as London prepares to celebrate the royal wedding in front of an estimated worldwide television audience of up to two billion .
The marriage of Prince William , the second in line to the throne , and Catherine Middleton at Westminster Abbey will be among the first global news events of the social media age .
It will also be the most important – and , courtiers hope , positive – event for the future of the monarchy in nearly 30 years .
London has been inundated with tourists and thousands were converging on the wedding route between the Mall and the abbey .
More than 8,500 journalists and broadcasting staff have arrived to cover the event , more than half of them from foreign news organisations .
The day is likely to be cool and cloudy in London , with rain later .
Across the country , stocks of bunting were said to have sold out .
It is expected that the Queen will bestow new titles – probably a dukedom – on her grandson and his bride .
Today the couple issued a statement in an official programme , 150,000 copies of which will be sold for charity in central London , saying they were "" incredibly moved "" by the public 's affection shown them since their engagement .
"" We are both so delighted that you are able to join us in celebrating what we hope will be one of the happiest days of our lives . ""
In a show of strength to forestall threats of demonstrations and disruption by anarchists , terrorists or extremist groups , Scotland Yard carried out a series of dawn raids across London .
Police with batons and riot gear arrested 20 people during an operation against five squats across the city .
Those arrested were taken to the Paddington Green high security police station and may be detained into the weekend .
There was a further arrest in Brighton on Wednesday .
Hundreds of Territorial Support Group officers were involved in what the Metropolitan police said was an ongoing operation to investigate suspected criminality linked to disorder at the student demonstration last December and the TUC march last month .
But the action amounted to a controversial pre - emptive strike which the Met said was "" intelligence led "" .
In the Commons , the Labour MP John McDonnell criticised the operation , saying it was "" disproportionate and no way to celebrate this glorious day "" .
For the wedding itself , under huge political pressure from the home secretary and the mayor of London , the Met is mounting one of the biggest security operations in its history , expected to cost £ 20 m , deploying 5,000 officers .
Some 900 uniformed officers will line the route from Westminster Abbey to Buckingham Palace , and undercover units and armed teams are being deployed to deal with a range of threats , from terrorism to direct action by activists .
Thousands of service personnel will also line the procession route .
More than 80 people arrested in connection with the student demonstration in December and last month 's TUC march have been barred from entering the City of Westminster under bail conditions imposed by the police and the courts .
Police spotters are being used to look out for any of these people arriving in central London .
Scotland Yard was unapologetic about its show of strength .
A spokesman said the raids were part of "" ongoing proactive work to tackle suspected criminality "" , not "" specifically related to the royal wedding [ but ] brought forward ahead of the event "" .
Lawyers and residents of one squat also said that most of the arrests were for "" abstracting electricity "" .
All police leave has been cancelled .
Just under 1,000 officers have been assigned to rapid response teams to deal with any incidents .
Assistant commissioner Lynne Owens , who is in charge of the operation , had warned that arrests might be made in pre - emptive strikes against individuals if intelligence showed they were planning criminal activity on the wedding day .
The Syrian ambassador , Sami Khiyami , had his invitation withdrawn by the foreign secretary , William Hague , after growing pressure from the media over the regime 's violent suppression of demonstrations in Syria .
Khiyami told the BBC : "" I find it a bit embarrassing …
well , I do n't really understand it , but I understand the influence of media on government . ""
But it emerged that another controversial figure is still attending the wedding – the former head of an agency accused of torture and human rights .
Sheikh Khalifa Bin Ali al - Khalifa , a former head of Bahrain 's National Security Agency , which is accused of torture and human rights abuses , is due to attend in his role as ambassador to London .
Bahrain 's crown prince withdrew at the weekend because of unrest in his country , but a spokesperson for the Bahraini embassy in London said the ambassador was expected to attend .
The wedding ceremony itself – the 15th royal marriage to be celebrated at the abbey since 1100 – will place emphasis on Britishness , with music from three living composers , including an anthem specially commissioned by the dean , chapter from John Rutter and music by the Welsh composer Paul Mealor as well as Sir Peter Maxwell Davies .
The Middleton family were spending the evening quietly at the Goring hotel near Buckingham Palace , which was cordoned off with a marquee shielding the entrance so that the bride will be able to slip unobserved into one of Buckingham Palace 's Rolls Royces for her journey to the abbey at precisely 10.51am this morning .
Her dress will not be revealed until she arrives at the abbey nine minutes later .
The designer Sarah Burton appeared to have entered the hotel in disguise this afternoon .
After the wedding there will be a lunchtime reception for 650 guests at Buckingham Palace , hosted by the Queen , and an obligatory balcony kiss for the newlyweds at 1.25pm – before the monarch and the Duke of Edinburgh head for the country , leaving 300 guests to return for a dinner hosted by Prince Charles in the evening .
Thousands of street parties – including one by anti - monarchists in central London – are planned for this afternoon , though undoubtedly the most publicised will be the one for 90 guests in Downing Street , supervised by Lady Warsi , giving a new dimension to the minister without portfolio 's job description .
Downing Street is being decked with flags and there will be a large screen to allow guests to watch the wedding coverage , a brass band , an ice - cream stall and children 's entertainment .
The only comment to emerge from the palace was when the Duchess of Cornwall ventured out of Clarence House to meet people camping on the Mall .
"" We 're all ready for tomorrow .
It 's wonderful and we 're all very excited , "" she said .
"" It 's such a great atmosphere here .
It is so nice to meet people and see the celebrations are getting under way . """

Guide me , O thou great Redeemer , pilgrim through this barren land ; I am weak , but thou art mighty ; hold me with thy powerful hand : Bread of heaven , feed me till I want no more .
Open now the crystal fountain whence
the healing stream doth flow ; let the fiery cloudy pillar lead me all my journey through : strong Deliverer , be thou still my strength and shield .
When I tread the verge of Jordan , bid my anxious fears subside ; Death of death , and hell 's Destruction , land me safe on Canaan 's side :
songs of praises I will ever give to thee .

The Dean gives The Welcome
And Introduction Dearly beloved , we are gathered here in the sight of God and in the face of this congregation , to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony ; which is an honourable estate , instituted of God himself , signifying unto us the mystical union that is betwixt Christ and his Church ; which holy estate Christ adorned and beautified with his presence , and first miracle that he wrought , in Cana of Galilee , and is commended in Holy Writ to be honourable among all men ; and therefore is not by any to be enterprised , nor taken in hand , unadvisedly , lightly , or wantonly ; but reverently , discreetly , soberly , and in the fear of God , duly considering the causes for which matrimony was ordained .
First , it was ordained for the increase of mankind according to the will of God , and that children might be brought up in the fear and nurture of the Lord , and to the praise of his holy name .
Secondly , it was ordained in order that the natural instincts and affections , implanted by God , should be hallowed and directed aright ; that those who are called of God to this holy estate , should continue therein in pureness of living .
Thirdly , it was ordained for the mutual society , help , and comfort , that the one ought to have of the other , both in prosperity and adversity .
Into which holy estate these two persons present come now to be joined .
Therefore if any man can shew any just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together , let him now speak , or else hereafter for ever hold his peace .
The Archbishop of Canterbury says to Prince William and Catherine : I require and charge you both , as ye will answer at the dreadful day of judgement when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed , that if either of you know any impediment , why ye may not be lawfully joined together in matrimony , ye do now confess it .
For be ye well assured , that so many as are coupled together otherwise than God 's word doth allow are not joined together by God ; neither is their matrimony lawful .
The Marriage The Archbishop says to Prince William :
William Arthur Philip Louis , wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife , to live together according to God 's law in the holy estate of matrimony ?
Wilt thou love her , comfort her , honour and keep her , in sickness and in health ; and , forsaking all other , keep thee only unto her , so long as ye both shall live ?
He answers : I will .
The Archbishop says to Catherine : Catherine Elizabeth , wilt thou have this man to thy wedded husband , to live together according to God 's law in the holy estate of matrimony ?
Wilt thou love him , comfort him , honour and keep him , in sickness and in health ; and , forsaking all other , keep thee only unto him , so long as ye both shall live ?
She answers : I will .
The Archbishop continues : Who giveth this woman to be married to this man ?
The Archbishop receives Catherine from her father 's hand .
Taking Catherine 's right hand , Prince William says after the Archbishop :
I , William Arthur Philip Louis , take thee , Catherine Elizabeth to my wedded wife , to have and to hold from this day forward , for better , for worse : for richer , for poorer ; in sickness and in health ; to love and to cherish , till death us do part , according to God 's holy law ; and thereto I give thee my troth .
They loose hands .
Catherine , taking Prince William by his right hand , says after the Archbishop :
I , Catherine Elizabeth , take thee , William Arthur Philip Louis , to my wedded husband , to have and to hold from this day forward , for better , for worse : for richer , for poorer ; in sickness and in health ; to love and to cherish , till death us do part , according to God 's holy law ; and thereto I give thee my troth .
They loose hands .
The Archbishop blesses the ring :
Bless , O Lord , this ring , and grant that he who gives it and she who shall wear it may remain faithful to each other , and abide in thy peace and favour , and live together in love until their lives ' end .
Through Jesus Christ our Lord .
Amen .
Prince William takes the ring and places it upon the fourth finger of Catherine 's left hand .
Prince William says after the Archbishop :
With this ring I thee we d ; with my body I thee honour ; and all my worldly goods with thee I share : in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost .
Amen .
The Congregation remains standing as the Couple kneels .
The Archbishop says : Let us pray .
O eternal God , Creator and Preserver of all mankind , giver of all spiritual grace , the author of everlasting life : send thy blessing upon these thy servants , this man and this woman , whom we bless in thy name ; that , living faithfully together , they may surely perform and keep the vow and covenant betwixt them made , whereof this ring given and received is a token and pledge ; and may ever remain in perfect love and peace together , and live according to thy laws ; through Jesus Christ our Lord .
Amen .
The Archbishop joins their right hands together and says : Those whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder .
The Archbishop addresses the Congregation : Forasmuch as William and Catherine have consented together in holy wedlock , and have witnessed the same before God and this company , and thereto have given and pledged their troth either to other , and have declared the same by giving and receiving of a ring , and by joining of hands ; I pronounce that they be man and wife together , in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost .
Amen .
The Archbishop blesses the Couple : God the Father , God the Son , God the Holy Ghost , bless , preserve , and keep you ; the Lord mercifully with his favour look upon you ; and so fill you with all spiritual benediction and grace , that ye may so live together in this life , that in the world to come ye may have life everlasting .
Amen .
All sing The Hymn Love divine , all loves excelling , joy of heaven , to earth come down , fix in us thy humble dwelling , all thy faithful mercies crown .
Jesu , thou art all compassion , pure unbounded love thou art ; visit us with thy salvation , enter every trembling heart .
Come , almighty to deliver , let us all thy life receive ; suddenly return , and never , never more thy temples leave .
Thee we would be always blessing , serve thee as thy hosts above , pray , and praise thee , without ceasing , glory in thy perfect love .
Finish then thy new creation , pure and spotless
let us be ; let us see thy great salvation , perfectly restored in thee , changed from glory into glory , till in heaven we take our place , till we cast our crowns before thee , lost in wonder , love , and praise !

Do not be conformed to this world , but be transformed by the renewing of your minds , so that you may discern what is the will of God - what is good and acceptable and perfect .
Let love be genuine ; hate what is evil , hold fast to what is good ; love one another with mutual affection ; outdo one another in showing honour .
Do not lag in zeal , be ardent in spirit , serve the Lord .
Rejoice in hope , be patient in suffering , persevere in prayer .
Contribute to the needs of the saints ; extend hospitality to strangers .
Bless those who persecute you ; bless and do not curse them .
Rejoice with those who rejoice , weep with those who weep .
Live in harmony with one another ; do not be haughty , but associate with the lowly ; do not claim to be wiser than you are .
Do not repay anyone evil for evil , but take thought for what is noble in the sight of all .
If it is possible , so far as it depends on you , live peaceably with all .

The Lord himself is thy keeper : the Lord is thy defence upon thy right hand ; so that the sun shall not burn thee by day : neither the moon by night .
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil : yea , it is even he that shall keep thy soul .
The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in : from this time forth for evermore .
He shall defend thee under his wings .
Be strong , and he shall comfort thine heart , and put thou thy trust in the Lord .

Amen .
O Merciful Lord and heavenly Father , by whose gracious gift mankind is increased ; bestow
, we beseech thee , upon these two persons the heritage and gift of children ; and grant that they may see their children christianly and virtuously brought up , to thy praise and honour ; through Jesus Christ our Lord .
Amen .
O God , who hast taught us that it should never be lawful to put asunder those whom thou by matrimony hadst made one , and hast consecrated the state of matrimony to such an excellent mystery , that in it is signified and represented the spiritual marriage and unity betwixt Christ and his Church : look mercifully upon these thy servants , that both this man may love his wife , according to thy word ( as Christ did love his spouse the Church , who gave himself for it , loving and cherishing it even as his own flesh ) , and also that this woman may be loving and amiable , and faithful to her husband , and in all quietness , sobriety , and peace , be a follower of holy and godly matrons .
O Lord , bless them both , and grant them to inherit thy everlasting kingdom ; through Jesus Christ our Lord .
Amen .
Almighty God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , pour upon you the riches of his grace , sanctify and bless you , that ye may please him both in body and soul , and live together in holy love unto your lives ' end .

2011-04-28,"Prince William and Kate Middleton 's impending nuptials are more important to the average American than to the average Briton – an unforeseen financial opportunity that both the royal family and David Cameron have failed , sadly , to exploit .
The announcement of the royal engagement was n't just news in America ; it was a sensation .
Americans have proudly claimed Kate as one of their own – after all , she is a distant relative of George Washington .
Transatlantic affection for the monarchy is exhibited most literally by the "" Harry hunters "" : young American women attending UK colleges who spend their weekends frequenting Prince Harry 's favourite London hangouts .
In striking contrast , the contemporary British attitude towards the royal family is a self - divided mix of disdain and deference .
Although the proportion of Britons who want to abolish the monarch has lingered around 30 % for decades , indifference and ridicule have risen significantly .
Prince Andrew has n't helped in that regard .
Membership in the anti - monarchy group , Republic , spiked following the engagement announcement .
Ordinary people seem underwhelmed by the sumptuous celebration .
Opinion polls find barely half of the British public are interested in the wedding , and only a third will watch it on television .
Comparatively few traditional street parties have been organised , despite Downing Street and several government departments feverishly urging participation .
A third of local authorities have received no street party applications at all .
The cold reality is that many plan to flee the UK for this particular bread - and - circuses event .
Thomas Cook 's bookings for April have risen 35 % and Ryanair 's bookings are up 65 % for the period .
What explains this transatlantic disconnect ?
On the British side , austerity and straitened economic circumstances are making people feel far from ready to party .
This may be a national celebration but many Britons have little to celebrate at the moment in their own lives .
And some clearly feel that this costly event is being used by the establishment to distract them from the hard choices ahead .
There are three reasons why Americans are comparatively enthusiastic about the wedding .
First , Americans have historically exhibited an even greater interest than the British in glittering celebrity ( especially celebrity drenched in centuries - old tradition ) .
Second , the US 's deeply rancourous red - blue partisan divide has heightened many Americans ' appreciation for a non - political , party - neutral head of state , a figurehead who keeps a country united .
And third , this particular wedding resonates with the American passion for upward social mobility .
It 's hard to think of anything less American than a hereditary monarchy .
But what 's particularly appealing to such an aspirational society is the idea of moving on and moving up .
In a recent TV interview , a young American woman observed about the likely future Queen : "" She 's not from a higher - placed family ; that speaks to the American Dream where you can be anything you want to be . ""
But very few Americans know that , in Orwellian fashion , the royal family is "" paying "" for the £ 30 m wedding out of its taxpayer - provided allowance , with taxpayers directly footing the bill for the extra policing and road closures , which will total more than £ 5 m .
To add economic insult to injury , Downing Street invested tens of millions of pounds leveraging the wedding by promoting Britain as the tourist destination that foreigners already know it to be .
Then , there 's the significant hidden economic cost to local councils and businesses of the paid public holiday the prime minister granted for the wedding .
According to the CBI , the extra Bank Holiday will cost the economy £ 6bn in lost productivity .
A savvy PR move saw the couple ask wellwishers to donate to among 26 favoured charities in lieu of wedding gifts .
But the savviest approach would have been to seek American corporate sponsors for the wedding .
Such a modern , ethical and financially prudent move would have saved hardpressed UK taxpayers tens of millions of pounds .
And it would have unleashed an unparalleled bidding war among American multinationals for the opportunity to market to a 1 billion - strong global TV audience – a pot of gold that could have financed the royal family for many years to come .
As the young couple has no qualms about their opulent lifestyle being continually and involuntarily underwritten by British taxpayers , why should a single act of voluntary patronage by wealthy American corporates cause them sleepless nights on their taxpayer - subsidised honeymoon ?
Americans are overwhelmingly drawn to a real - life British soap opera that combines celebrity , heritage , and the promise of a life less ordinary .
Hence the monarchy 's and the government 's missed opportunity both to democratise and to economise on William and Kate 's big day ."
2011-04-28,"After months of secrecy and speculation surrounding the royal wedding dress , the Guardian can today exclusively reveal that Kate Middleton will be wearing a vintage - inspired , bias - cut ivory LibÃ © lula gown designed by Sophie Cranston when she marries Prince William on Friday .
Or at least that 's the consensus among the more than 3,000 people who have taken part in our wedding dress crowdsourcing exercise .
At the time of writing , some 33 % plumped for Cranston , followed by Alice Temperley ( 20 % ) , then Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen and Bruce Oldfield ( 17 % each ) .
This tallies with the Huffington Post 's "" exclusive revelation "" last week that Cranston is the chosen designer
( and Middleton did wear a LibÃ © lula coat to a friend 's wedding in January ) .
Meanwhile the Daily Mail has told us both that three gowns have been ordered and that Kate has actually designed the dress herself .
Obviously none of you really know , but the wisdom of the crowd can sometimes be an accurate indicator ( we did pretty well on the Apple iPad ahead of its launch early last year ) .
A clear majority of you ( 57 % ) think the dress will be ivory , with only 20 % thinking Catherine will plump for white ( it turns out , incidentally , that the equation of white with virginity is a recent notion â€ “ before Queen Victoria popularised the white wedding dress brides wore any colour , and blue denoted purity ) .
Plus , 67 % of you think she 'll go for sleeves rather than something strappy or a bandeau style , with the pro - sleeve brigade fairly evenly divided between short and long sleeves .
As for headgear , a veil is favoured by a hefty 74 % ; the choice of tiara is more tricky â€ “ joint favourites ( at 34 % each ) are the Queen Mother 's Strathmore Rose tiara and the Cambridge Lovers Knot ( given by the Queen to Princess Diana as a wedding gift and returned after the divorce ) , with the George III fringe tiara trailing behind at 22 % .
So did Guardian readers get it right ?
All will be revealed on 29 April ."
2011-04-28,"Kate Middleton will not promise to "" obey "" her husband Prince William , following in the footsteps of his mother in departing from the ancient church formulations of the wedding service .
Unlike earlier generations , few brides today would use the term , and the word does not appear in the wedding service chosen for Friday .
Princess Diana , 30 years ago , also did not promise to obey , and in her case that turned out to be true .
Details about the service and the music chosen for the occasion were released on Thursday morning , together with a special wedding programme â€ “ customary at royal weddings â€ “ which will be sold for charity to the crowds in central London in the morning .
Dr Rowan Williams , the archbishop of Canterbury , who is conducting the service , will ask Middleton of her husband whether she will "" love him , comfort him , honour and keep him in sickness and in health and , forsaking all others , keep only unto him so long as ye both shall live "" .
This morning , as musicians prepared for their final run - throughs in Westminster Abbey â€ “ which has been closed to the public since Monday â€ “ one more rehearsal for the service was held for the bridal couple and other participants .
There will be technical rehearsals on Thursday too for broadcasters .
The marriage music features works by two living British composers : Sir Peter Maxwell Davies , the master of the Queen 's music , and the Welsh composer Paul Mealor , who lives in Aberdeen and composes much of his work on Angelsey .
Other works by major British 20th - century composers will also include Vaughan Williams 's Fantasia on Greensleeves and Prelude on Rhosymedre , Elgar 's Serenade for Strings and Britten 's Galliard from his opera Gloriana , together with Delius 's On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring and Finzi 's Romance for String Orchestra .
There will also be the famous old hymns Guide Me O Thou Great Redeemer â€ “ a gesture perhaps to William 's Welsh links â€ “ and Charles Wesley 's Love Divine
All Loves Excelling , as well as William Blake 's Jerusalem , a song occasionally banned by some Anglican clergy as being insufficiently religious .
Mealor , who is 35 , said : "" I was thrilled to hear that Prince William had chosen my music for his wedding .
How humbling it is for me to know that Prince William and Catherine will celebrate the beginning of their lives together with my music .
The ceremony is going to be , without a doubt , the most emotionally intense and exhilarating hour of my life . ""
A new trumpet fanfare has also been composed for the start of the couple 's procession at the end of the service .
Called Valiant and Brave â€ “ the motto of 22 Squadron , with whom William is currently serving as a search and rescue helicopter pilot â€ “ the 30-second piece has been composed by Duncan Stubbs , the RAF 's director of music services .
He said : "" Basically , I have taken examples of fanfares that we know and recognise and just added my own thoughts and ideas to that . ""
In a message in the official wedding programme , the couple say they have been "" incredibly moved "" by people 's affection towards them .
They add : "" We are both so delighted that you are able to join us in celebrating what we hope will be one of the happiest days of our lives
â€
¦
We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone most sincerely for their kindness . ""
The Goring hotel near Buckingham Palace , where the Middletons will be spending the night , has been sealed off by police in preparation for their arrival ."
2011-04-28,"The first thing to be said about today 's royal wedding is unconditional .
We wish Prince William and Catherine Middleton a long and happy married life together .
From that wish , a range of other simple and unvarnished hopes – which strangers with goodwill towards any marriage instinctively feel – all follow .
That the day goes well for the couple in every possible way .
That today 's pageantry is not marred by anything inappropriate .
That the young couple 's happiness is the day 's focus and its abiding memory .
That , from today , William and Catherine are now allowed some privacy as they accustom themselves to the private and public changes that their wedding heralds .
We hope that today 's marriage – and you may choose whatever meaning you are most comfortable with from this wish – will be truly blessed .
We also hope , in spite of this paper 's continuing republican sympathies , that today 's wedding can be a useful collective experience for the Britain over which today 's couple may reign one day as King and Queen .
After the hysteria , infantilisation and general disproportion that so often surrounded royal events towards the end of the 20th century , a proper sense of perspective about where this wedding stands in the national scheme of things in the 21st would be very welcome and reassuring .
Benevolent mood
In the past days and weeks , the public has shown rather more sign of possessing that good judgment than much of the media has done .
This is not a fairytale moment .
Modern Britain is not fairyland .
A Guardian / ICM opinion poll earlier this week found only one in five Britons admits to being strongly interested in today 's events .
Three out of four , on the other hand , recognise that today should help to cheer the nation up a bit .
The mood , in other words , is rightly benevolent , though as much for a welcome day off , and perhaps a bit of a party , as for any great constitutional issue .
It is not entirely clear whether Buckingham Palace gets it .
It would definitely have helped , in this low - key but big - tent spirit , if the royals had invited former Labour prime ministers as well as inviting former Conservative ones .
That spiteful symbolic snub , alongside the tickets dished out – and in Syria 's case withdrawn – to tyrants and their professional apologists , speaks volumes about a British ruling class which is slipping quickly back into its old ways now that the natural order of things has been restored under the Tories .
The future of the monarchy , though , is very clearly a matter for another day rather than this .
When that debate comes , which it should and will – certainly before the next reign – the outcome will depend on events and personalities as much as on constitutional principle .
The removal of the indefensible parts of the Act of Settlement is an early priority , and now has David Cameron 's backing .
Last weekend 's poll depicted us as a people made up of a large majority of moderate rather than hysterical monarchists and a significant minority of not implacable republicans .
But these sentiments are not set in stone .
The monarchy 's place in the British people 's sense of patriotism is contingent .
In a democracy , nothing should be taken for granted .
Prince William and Ms Middleton , whose generation is less monarchist , seem more alive to this mood than the generation of Princes Charles and Andrew .
Recent royal history makes the cautious approach unavoidable .
For all the understandable excitement associated with a very public wedding and national occasion , there is an equally understandable public soberness this time too .
These are tough times for millions of British people .
This is not a day for demented princess worship or for in - your - face state extravagance .
Even if it was , the recent past inevitably casts a shadow over the occasion .
As far as dream royal weddings are concerned , Britain is a once - bitten - twice - shy country .
Those who remember the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer , 30 summers ago , will sense the welcome difference of tone this time .
The wedding of 1981 was fuelled by excitement and generosity too .
But it was also pumped up with an overdose of public adrenaline , much of it media - driven .
This helped to create an unrealistically heavy expectation whose weight even a much better matched couple than Charles and Diana would have struggled to bear .
Theirs was the supposedly fairytale wedding that became a wretched marriage with a tragic outcome .
Human beings do not always learn from their mistakes .
But the build - up to the wedding of 2011 has been a bit more restrained .
And that provides cause for hope that some of the public foolishness and private misery of last time will not be repeated .
Back to reality
So , have a wonderful day .
But stay real about it too .
Any wedding is a statement of hope about the future ; the grandest and most public wedding of this generation inevitably makes a bigger statement .
But how big should that statement be ?
That the marriage of a prince and his bride somehow make everything better and more meaningful for the rest of the nation ?
That would be a profoundly false message .
Away from the pealing bells and swelling choruses in the abbey , today 's grandeur is largely vicarious .
Hope is a commodity in short supply right now , even – and in many cases especially – among William and Catherine 's fellow twentysomethings .
In any generation there is room for only one king and one queen .
Millions of the young couple 's fellow citizens in their 20s , meanwhile , lead lives marked by student debt , by the difficulty of finding a secure job , of getting somewhere affordable to live , and of matching their lived reality to the material and emotional aspirations the surrounding culture sleeplessly and cruelly promotes to them .
Not all of their relationships endure either .
Enjoy the big show .
Good luck to the newlyweds .
But the public mood is right .
For most of us this is a day off .
It is a day for a smile and a toast , not a day for standing to attention and tugging of forelocks .
Tomorrow , and on every other day of the year , we will have to re - enter the world of reality ."
2011-04-28,"Prince William and Kate Middleton have attended a rehearsal for their wedding at Westminster Abbey .
Prince Harry , William 's best man , was present at the runthrough along with Middleton 's parents , Michael and Carole , her sister Pippa , who is the maid of honour , and her brother James .
They were joined by all the senior churchmen involved in the ceremony , including the Archbishop of Canterbury , Dr Rowan Williams , who is marrying the couple , the Bishop of London , the Rt Rev Richard Chartres , who will give the address , and the Dean of Westminster , the Very Rev Dr John Hall , who is conducting the service .
Royal wedding rehearsals have been held elsewhere but not inside the abbey .
Middleton , 29 , will have walked up the nave arm - in - arm with her father and gone through her vows with her 28-year - old fiance .
The royal brothers were casually dressed in dark suits but did not appear to be wearing ties , while Middleton wore a black jacket and a blue skirt .
A St James 's Palace spokesman confirmed the event , saying : "" The couple are attending a private wedding rehearsal at the abbey this evening . ""
The rehearsal is for them and the clergy , and others taking part in the service , such as Prince Harry and the Middleton family . ""
Middleton returned with her fiance to his apartments at nearby Clarence House , where it is thought they will spend their last night together before the wedding .
On the eve of the nuptials the groom will have dinner with his father , the Prince of Wales , the Duchess of Cornwall and his brother at Clarence House .
His fiancee will spend her last night as an unmarried woman with her family at the Goring hotel in Belgravia .
During the day Dr John Sentamu , the Archbishop of York , said the royal wedding would help "" inject a bit of hope "" into the country as some people struggled to make ends meet and find work .
Commenting about the couple cohabiting before marriage , he added : "" We are living at a time where some people , as my daughter used to say , want to test whether the milk is good before they buy the cow . ""
What is important actually is not simply to look at the past .
Because you see they 're going to be standing in the abbey , taking these wonderful vows - a commitment for life . ""
With less than two days until the wedding , hundreds of tourists have already flocked to the abbey , where some have pitched around 30 tents in a bid to claim the best vantage point .
Christopher Farrow , 50 , has been camping outside Westminster Abbey since Tuesday , in the hope of being at the front of the crowd when the royal procession comes through .
Farrow , who lives in Victoria , said : "" I had a lot of respect for Diana and all the charity work she did , I hope Kate will do the same .
"" It 's lovely seeing Will and Harry carrying on their mother 's work
and I hope to see Harry 's wedding to Chelsy next . """

2011-04-29,"Prince William and Kate Middleton have been pronounced husband and wife at Westminister Abbey in London .
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge , as they will now be known , made their vows in front of 1,900 guests and the eyes of the world .
All eyes were on the bride as she made her way towards the abbey .
She showed few signs of nerves , smiling and waving at the crowds from her limousine and sat next to her father , Michael .
The bride opted for a simple creation by Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen with lace sleeves , a swagged train and a fine veil of chantilly lace .
According to Buckingham Palace the dress "" epitomises timeless British craftsmanship by drawing together talented and skilled workmanship from across the United Kingdom "" .
Flanked by her sister and maid of honour , Pippa Middleton , who was wearing a long , cream silk gown , the bride was also accompanied by young bridesmaids Eliza Lopes , Grace van Cutsem , Louise Mountbatten - Windsor , and Margarita Armstrong - Jones , and pageboys Tom Pettifer and William Lowther - Pinkerton .
Prince William stood next to his brother , Prince Harry , and as his girlfriend of 10 years joined him at the altar the heir to the throne broke into a smile .
Kate 's mother , Carole Middleton , wearing a fitted blue - grey Catherine Walker outfit , looked on with pride .
The wedding ceremony passed without hitch , with the only moment of tension provided as Prince William struggled to put the ring , fashioned from Welsh gold given to Prince William by the Queen , on his bride 's finger .
After the vows Rowan Williams , the archbishop of Canterbury , declared : "" I pronounce that they be man and wife together , in the name of the father , and of the son , and of the Holy Ghost .
Amen . ""
In a prayer , written by the couple for the occasion , they said : "" God our father , we thank you for our families ; for the love that we share and for the joy of our marriage . ""
As the couple left Westminster Abbey the crowds , some of whom had been camping for days for the moment , erupted into a fresh wave of cheers as they climbed into state landau carriages for the horse - drawn procession to Buckingham Palace .
The married couple waved at crowds as they passed the crowds via Parliament Square , Whitehall , Horse Guards and the Mall .
Despite fears of thundery showers , threatening grey skies produced no rain .
The couple joined the Queen who is giving a lunchtime reception at Buckingham Palace for 650 guests , described by the palace as "" a private gathering for guests drawn from the congregation who will represent the couple 's official and private lives "" .
At just before 1.30pm William and Kate kissed for the first time in public on the balcony of Buckingham Palace .
The fleeting embrace sent the already ecstatic crowds wild , and was repeated during a flypast .
After more than five minutes of waving to the crowds , the couple walked hand in hand back through the doors of the palace .
Earlier , stepping on to the balcony , Kate appeared to gasp "" Oh my "" as the royal couple saw the thousands of well - wishers lining the Mall before being joined by members of their family .
The Prince of Wales will give a private dinner , followed by dancing , for close friends and family ."
2011-04-29,"Kate Middleton will become a duchess on her wedding to Prince William and not , officially at least , a princess .
Buckingham Palace has announced that the Queen has gifted her grandson the title Duke of Cambridge on his wedding day â€ “ a dukedom being the highest rank in the British peerage .
As such , Kate will become Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge .
There had been speculation that the Queen might confer a title that would allow her to be called Princess Catherine .
Instead , the monarch has stuck to tradition .
Her own husband , Philip , who relinquished his princely Greek title before they we d , had to wait 10 years before he became a prince again .
And according to protocol , while William was born Prince William of Wales , his bride , who is not a royal in her own right , does not have the title Princess William of Wales , although through marrying William she could technically be described as such .
Explaining the slightly confusing picture , a palace spokesman said : "" She is not a princess in her own right .
That title has not been conferred on her .
Her title is that of duchess .
So she is not Princess Catherine .
And to call her Princess William of Wales is misleading . ""
William also becomes the Earl of Strathearn and Baron Carrickfergus , which means Kate can add Countess of Strathearn and Baroness Carrickfergus to her royal titles .
All titles are in the gift of the Queen .
The full palace statement , released three hours before the wedding ceremony , read : "" The Queen has today been pleased to confer a Dukedom on Prince William of Wales .
His titles will be Duke of Cambridge , Earl of Strathearn and Baron Carrickfergus .
Prince William thus becomes His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge and Miss Catherine Middleton on marriage will become Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge . ""
The Duke of Cambridge was seen as a favourite for William 's new title in the runup to the wedding , the Queen fuelling speculation by visiting the city two days ago .
It could be considered appropriate since the last Duke of Cambridge , Prince George , a grandson of George III , was a military figure who married a commoner for love .
But there the similiarities end .
George married the actor Sarah Louisa Fairbrother in 1847 , when she was pregnant with their third child , refusing to have an arranged marriage and declaring such unions "" doomed to failure "" .
That marriage was never recognised by his cousin , Queen Victoria .
He went on to keep a mistress for some 30 years .
There is an equestrian statue of him in the middle of London 's Whitehall , which William and Kate would be able to see from their carriage procession after the service ."
2011-04-29,"The impending marriage of Prince William and Catherine ' Kate ' Middleton has caused a cascade of information since their engagement wasannounced last November .
According to Google over 162 million web pages mentioning the wedding are available and we can only guess at the number of column inches the news has created .
So here at the Datablog we got curious as to how the wedding breaks down into numbers , from the serious to the silly including cost to the economy , number of police dogs on the day and the number of rich tea biscuits going into the ' secret recipe ' chocolate cake .
The numbers we have found only brush the surface of this huge event but here are some interesting numbers : â€¢
The wedding is estimated to bring an estimated Â£630 million into the economy with reference surely to the copious amount of souvenirs being sold â€¢ 5000 police officers will be deployed on the day , that 's 500 more than at the Anti - cuts march earlier this year but 213 less than present at Prince Charles and Diana 's wedding in 1981 â€¢
At 29 , Kate Middleton will be the oldest royal bride and also the only royal bride to hold a degree .
Prince William and his bride both received 2:1 degrees from the University of St. Andrews â€¢ Over 1,700 Rich Tea biscuits have gone into making the ' secret recipe ' chocolate cake by McVities , a favourite of the Prince apparently â€¢
There will be eight 20-feet high trees : six English Field Maple and two Hornbeam in Westminster Abbey as part of the floral arrangement â€¢ Over 2bn people worldwide are expected to watch the wedding compared to 28.4 million who watched the marriage of Prince Charles and Diana in 1981

2011-04-29,"Bells pealed , crowds cheered , even the sun put in a timely appearance , as Prince William emerged from Westminster Abbey with his bride on his arm .
Wearing a broad smile , a Wartski wedding ring of Welsh gold and an ivory gown with lace applique , Kate Middleton â€ “ now
Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge â€ “ joined The Firm amid the pomp and pageantry Britain prides itself on performing well .
Before a global television audience of many millions , Kate played her part to perfection .
From the dress â€ “ by Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen , kept a secret until the last moment and sending the British fashion industry into paroxyms of ecstacy â€ “ to the 1936 Cartier diamond tiara loaned by the Queen , she looked every inch the fairytale princess .
Which , of course , she was not .
The Queen 's conferring of the ancient title of Duke of Cambridge on her grandson just hours before the ceremony deprived his wife of the title Princess Catherine .
But she is a duchess , which is several rungs up the social ladder than her standing before entering the 1,000-year - old abbey this morning .
And there was no mention of fairytales
â€ “ unlike 30 years ago when Robert Runcie , then Archbishop of Canterbury , gushingly pronounced Prince Charles 's union with Lady Diana Spencer "" the stuff of fairytales "" .
Lessons have since been learned .
Instead , the Bishop of London , the Rt Rev Richard Chartres , read a prayer penned by William and Kate , and asking for spiritual help to guide them through their new life together .
And this time , the bride did not forget her groom 's name and the groom did not stumble over the wedding vows .
Indeed , apart from some slight wrestling required get the tight ring on to Kate 's finger , everything appeared to go without a hitch .
William , in the bright red dress uniform of a colonel of the Irish Guards , whispered : "" You look incredible , beautiful , "" as his bride arrived at his side in front of the High Altar .
The two exchanged smiles and glances throughout the service .
The couple , in the 1902 state landau , were borne to Buckingham Palace on a sea of union flags and a tide of well wishes .
And the kiss on the palace balcony , duly demanded by the crowd below , was executed with poise and with a few blushes from an embarrassed William .
It was a fleeting and quite chaste kiss .
It was repeated as the crowd bayed for more , with William 's seeming awkwardness reflecting his father 's own self - consciousness when he had been required to perform "" that caper "" in front of millions .
It was the father of the modern British constitution , the 19th - century essayist Walter Bagehot , who once wrote "" a royal family sweetens politics by the seasonable addition of nice and pretty events "" .
Such was today 's occasion , a moment of light to pierce the economic gloom .
Kate , unblemished , beautiful and carrying a bridal bouquet that included sweet williams in tribute to her prince , hid her nerves well .
There surely were nerves as the couple made their vows in front of God , the so - called great and the good and a global TV audience of millions .
About 44 foreign royals were seated close to 51 members of the Queen 's extended family .
The lesser royals had been bussed to the abbey in minibuses .
After the couple said their vows , in which she did not promise to obey William , the archbishop of Canterbury , Rowan Williams , declared : "" I pronounce that they be man and wife together , in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost .
Amen .
"" They spent a private moment together with their families as they signed the marriage register .
The congregation included heads of state , diplomats , charity workers and the couple 's friends .
David Beckham , prominently displaying his OBE on the right lapel of his Ralph Lauren morning suit , was accompanied by his pregnant wife Victoria .
Elton John , the singer , and Guy Ritchie , the film director , were among the celebrity faction .
David Cameron , who slept on the Mall the night before Charles and Diana 's wedding , wore morning dress while his wife , Samantha , chose to go hatless , unlike most of the female guests .
The Middleton family guests were bussed in four silver mini - coaches from the Goring hotel , which the family had taken over for the pre - wedding night , thus bestowing on the hotel global publicity of inestimable value .
Other guests included Hash and Chan Shingadia , who run the convenience store in the Middletons ' Berkshire village of Bucklebury , and obligingly added a love of Haribo sweets to Kate 's many attributes .
Villagers not in possession of a golden wedding ticket indulged in some celebratory duck and lamb racing on the green â€ “ and a spot of morris dancing .
Back at Buckingham Palace , 650 of the guests enjoyed a champagne and canape reception .
Royal officials said William and Kate were involved in planning their wedding day , from the music at the ceremony to the flowers and the cake .
Guests and observers agreed , it was a stylish marriage .
Naturally it included a carriage .
There was , though , a bicycle made for two at their disposal â€ “ a tandem given to the couple as a wedding present by the London mayor , Boris Johnson ."
2011-04-29,"As Kate Middleton we d her Prince William , thousands of people across Cardiff joined in to celebrate the marriage of the happy couple .
Residents joined a group watching on the big screen in the Hayes , and landlords opened up their pubs for people to watch the action on TV .
At the All Nations Church in Eastern Avenue , Heath , the wedding was screened on a huge television in the church hall .
Church leader Tim Jones said : "" We started setting up at 6 am .
It 's been a fantastic day so far .
More than 120 people came to watch the wedding on our big screen , and we 're expecting up to 300 people to be drifting around throughout the afternoon enjoying our free hog roast and barbecue . ""
With fashionistas giving their official verdict on Kate 's Alexander McQueen dress , Cardiffian 's gave their own view on its sartorial merits .
Event organiser
Danielle Muirhead said : "" Kate looked absolutely stunning .
I got quite emotional as I watched her making her way to the Abbey .
"" It was really lovely to watch the wedding with such a big group of people at the church hall , we all joined in signing the hymns , it was as if we were at the service with them . ""
Enjoying a Pimms and strawberries on a picnic rug with friends , party goer Keri Hiscott from Heath said : "" I thought the ceremony was lovely , Kate and William came across as really normal and personable .
You can tell they 're genuinely in love . ""
Hiscott and her friends had to contend with the blustery weather felt all over the city .
"" We 're not moving anywhere , if we get up now our picnic rug will be blown away .
We 're stationed here with our Pimms for the afternoon .
"" We 've previously reported how there were more than 50 street parties planned for the big day .
In Canton , a street party based out of the Victoria Park pub took over the end of Kingsland Road with food and drink stalls and games for the kids .
Entertainment was provided by the children 's dance troupe Rubylicious , all aged between 4 and 7 , who put on a Michael Jackson medley among other moves .
Victoria Park landlady
Penny Bradley said : "" It 's a shame it 's so windy today , but despite the weather lots of people have made it out .
We 're holding a children 's tea party with cakes and jelly , and there 's going to be a disco in the pub tonight too .
I 'll be getting dolled up in a union jack dress with lots of red lippy . ""
Linda Collins , owner of Sweet Tooth sweet shop in Ely , had set up a stall on Kingsland Road .
She said Cardiff had been a ghost town in the morning as everyone stayed in to watch the wedding .
She added : "" I had a lump in my throat as I watched Kate today , she looked absolutely mesmerising .
Her parents must have been filled with pride .

2011-04-29,"Thousands of well - wishers have lined the mile - and - a - half route to Westminster Abbey in London to celebrate the marriage of Prince William , the second in line to the throne , and Catherine Middleton on Friday .
Foreign dignitaries have flown in from around the world and London has been inundated with tourists who have converged at the scene to await the arrival of the first of 1,900 guests at the abbey from 8:15am .
William and his brother Prince Harry , 26 , who is his best man , are expected to arrive at 10.15am .
The wedding will be among the first global news events of the social media age : a service full of pomp and ceremony that has thrust the monarchy to centre stage .
It will also be the most important – and , courtiers hope , positive – event for the future of the monarchy in nearly 30 years .
Middleton , 29 , accompanied by Prince Harry , attended a rehearsal on Thursday at Westminster Abbey , the coronation church for the monarchy since William the Conqueror in 1066 .
In the evening , Prince William , 28 , reached into the crowds waiting on the Mall , shaking hands and telling delighted members of the public he was focusing on "" remembering the lines "" for the "" big day "" .
It is expected that the Queen will bestow give new titles – probably a dukedom – on her grandson and his bride .
The Middleton family spent the evening quietly at the Goring hotel near Buckingham Palace , which was cordoned off with a marquee shielding the entrance so that the bride will be able to slip unobserved into one of Buckingham Palace 's Rolls - Royces for her journey to the abbey at precisely 10.51am .
Her dress will not be revealed until she arrives at the abbey nine minutes later .
The designer Sarah Burton , who is creative director for Alexander McQueen , appeared to have entered the hotel in disguise .
The couple issued a statement in an official programme , 150,000 copies of which will be sold for charity in central London , saying they were "" incredibly moved "" by the public 's affection shown them since their engagement .
"" We are both so delighted that you are able to join us in celebrating what we hope will be one of the happiest days of our lives . ""
The wedding ceremony itself – the 15th royal marriage to be celebrated at the abbey since 1100 – will place emphasis on Britishness , with music from three living composers , including a specially commissioned anthem by John Rutter , music by the Welsh composer Paul Mealor as well as Sir Peter Maxwell Davies .
The abbey has been decorated with an "" avenue of trees "" along the nave made up of eight English field maples and two hornbeams It is likely to be cool and cloudy in London for the wedding day , with rain later .
The police and intelligence services have launched an unprecedented security operation as London prepares to celebrate the royal wedding with an extra 600,000 visitors predicted in the capital on Friday .
More than 8,500 journalists and broadcasting staff have arrived to cover the event , more than half of them from foreign news organisations .
Across the country , stocks of bunting were said to have sold out .
In a show of strength to forestall threats of demonstrations and disruption by anarchists , terrorists or extremist groups , Scotland Yard carried out a series of dawn raids across London .
Police with batons and riot gear arrested 20 people during an operation against five squats across the city .
Those arrested were taken to the Paddington Green high security police station and may be detained into the weekend .
Hundreds of Territorial Support Group officers were involved in what the Metropolitan police said was an ongoing operation to investigate suspected criminality linked to disorder at the student demonstration last December and the TUC march last month .
But the action amounted to a controversial pre - emptive strike which the Met said was "" intelligence led "" .
In the Commons , the Labour MP John McDonnell criticised the operation , saying it was "" disproportionate and no way to celebrate this glorious day "" .
For the wedding itself , under huge political pressure from the home secretary and the mayor of London , the Met is mounting one of the biggest security operations in its history , expected to cost £ 20 m , deploying 5,000 officers .
Some 900 uniformed officers will line the route from Westminster Abbey to Buckingham Palace , and undercover units and armed teams are being deployed to deal with a range of threats , from terrorism to direct action by activists .
Thousands of service personnel will also line the procession route .
The Syrian ambassador , Sami Khiyami , had his invitation withdrawn by the foreign secretary , William Hague , after growing pressure from the media over the regime 's violent suppression of demonstrations in Syria .
Khiyami told the BBC : "" I find it a bit embarrassing …
well , I do n't really understand it , but I understand the influence of media on government . ""
But it emerged that another controversial figure is still attending the wedding – the former head of an agency accused of torture and human rights .
Sheikh Khalifa Bin Ali al - Khalifa , a former head of Bahrain 's National Security Agency , which is accused of torture and human rights abuses , is due to attend in his role as ambassador to London .
Bahrain 's crown prince withdrew at the weekend because of unrest in his country , but a spokesperson for the Bahraini embassy in London said the ambassador was expected to attend .
After the wedding there will be a lunchtime reception for 650 guests at Buckingham Palace , hosted by the Queen , and an obligatory balcony kiss for the newlyweds at 1.25pm – before the monarch and the Duke of Edinburgh head for the country , leaving 300 guests to return for a dinner hosted by Prince Charles in the evening .
Thousands of street parties – including one by anti - monarchists in central London – are planned for this afternoon , though undoubtedly the most publicised will be the one for 90 guests in Downing Street , supervised by Lady Warsi , giving a new dimension to the minister without portfolio 's job description .
Downing Street is being decked with flags and there will be a large screen to allow guests to watch the wedding coverage , a brass band , an ice - cream stall and children 's entertainment ."
2011-04-29,"It is too early for the official TV ratings but early figures from the electricity network suggest that the audience for the royal wedding may match or possibly even exceed the 28 million who tuned in for the union of Charles and Diana in 1981 .
The National Grid reported a higher than expected surge in demand for electricity of 2,400 megawatts ( MW ) following the newly - anointed Duke and Duchess of Cambridge 's arrival at Buckingham Palace from Westminster Abbey .
The surge , which indicates that people have stopped watching the television to do something else –
the typical example is boiling a kettle – is even bigger than the 1,800MW surge that followed the nuptials of Prince William 's parents 30 years ago .
It is the fourth highest power surge of all time but still some way behind the record 2,800MW increase in demand that followed England 's semi - final penalty shootout defeat by West Germany in the 1990 football World Cup .
It remains to be seen whether the combined audience across the three channels which broadcast Friday 's events – BBC1 , ITV1 and Sky News – will match the 28.4 million viewers who watched the wedding of Charles and Diana on BBC1 and ITV1 on 29 July 1981 .
The most popular TV event of all time in the UK was the 1966 World Cup final , seen by 32.3 million people across the BBC and ITV .
The record audience for a single programme on one channel was the 30.1 million who tuned into EastEnders on Christmas Day on BBC1 in 1986 .
The various surges – and falls – in demand for electricity are a rough indicator of public interest in this sort of TV event , and hence how big the ratings are going to be .
The National Grid statistics suggest viewers were most interested in the moment Catherine Middleton stepped out of the car to reveal her dress , the couple 's exchange of vows in Westminster Abbey and their double kiss on the balcony of Buckingham Palace .
Friday 's surge in demand – the equivalent of just under 1 million people boiling a kettle – was higher than anticipated by the National Grid , which had expected something between 1,200MW and 1,600MW .
The largest surge in demand during Charles and Diana 's wedding in 1981 was 1,800MW , equivalent to 720,000 kettles being boiled at the same time .
By contrast , the biggest surge for Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys - Jones 's big day in 1999 was around 750MW .
The second biggest rise in demand for power was another England football defeat – this time to Brazil in the 2002 World Cup , and the third was an episode of mini - series The Thorn Birds in 1984 .
John Carnwath , power system manager in National Grid 's control room during the ceremony , said : "" It 's been a fascinating day to work in our control room , seeing the huge impact on electricity demand of millions of people across Britain being brought together by William and Kate 's wedding .
We 're proud of the role we have played in helping the nation share their big day . """
2011-04-29,"As a Guardian - reading Catholic monarchist , I must disagree with your royal wedding leader ( 29 April ) .
You may wish Prince William and Catherine Middleton all the best , but your sympathies lie elsewhere .
The Guardian wants Britain to replace its constitutional monarchy with a republic .
The majority of Britons wish to retain it , while repealing parts of the Act of Settlement .
You say it is wrong to have a lavish ceremony during a recession .
Should the wedding of Britain 's future king be done on a shoestring ?
Has the Guardian not heard of soft power ?
Pageantry and history are what we do best .
As for costs , the wedding will more than pay for itself with a huge worldwide TV audience , and all the attendant income from tourism .
Finally , you mention "" that spiteful symbolic snub "" of not inviting Tony Blair and Gordon Brown to the wedding .
This is easily explained by one person , Cherie Blair .
As the prime minister 's wife she breached protocol by refusing to curtsey to the Queen .
Then her boorish behaviour at the Braemar Games ( yawning while sitting behind the monarch ) made her persona non grata .
Of course the Queen would have liked to have invited the former Labour prime ministers , but she could not invite one without the other .

As a staunch non - royalist and a humanist , I have a confession to make : I really enjoyed and was moved by the royal wedding .
Kate looked fabulous and William is clearly a really decent bloke .
The impact of Lady Di was there for all to see , though was not mentioned by the impressive array of commentators wheeled out by the BBC .
Di 's transformation of the old creaking monarchy meant that the occasion had a flavour of genuine warmth and relaxation that Di herself , as the blushing bride almost 10 years Kate 's junior , was not able to enjoy back in 1981 .
The imprint of Di sits strongly on William and Harry , not only in their facial expressions but also their warmth and empathy for other people .
Without Di , of course , we would not have had Elton John in attendance , though it was puzzling to see him looking like a novice as he tentatively picked his way through the stirring rendition of Jerusalem .
Tony Blair 's absence was clearly explained by his telling the queen a home truth or two about the Palace 's silence following Di 's death in 1997 .
The many glimpses of David Cameron and Nick Clegg contrasted sharply to none of Ed Miliband .
What a long way the monarchy has come in just a short time and how much more accessible and durable it is now .
We all know who we have to thank for that , and we should never forget it .

I was absolutely sickened to read of the pre - emptive arrests of Prof Chris Knight and Love Police activist Charlie Veitch , to name but two .
It seems to me that this sort of police brutality belongs not in the United Kingdom , but in tyrannical dictatorships .
Knight 's pre - crime was supposedly for being part of a street theatre group planning to perform a pro - democracy piece .
In a video I 've watched , one man was arrested because he was in a costume .
Veitch , held at Cambridge police station , was also arrested for "" conspiracy to commit public nuisance "" – with no evidence whatsoever to back this up .
To me , this is oppression pure and simple .
It is vile , to put it mildly .
Thanks to the last Labour government , we now have draconian laws giving scarily large powers to the police forces in our country .
This has got to change .

In his paean to the kings and queens of England ( Should a democracy have a King Wills and Queen Kate ?
You can do worse , 28 April ) , Timothy Garton Ash describes the thousand - year history of the monarchy as "" an amazing thing … the stuff of poetry "" , and we are invited to "" imagine Shakespeare purged of all references to kingship "" .
Why should we ?
So far as I know , no modern republican has proposed censoring Shakespeare .
Tudor England was ruled by a monarch ; it is not evident what bearing that has on the desirability of the monarchy in 2011 . ""
Before you abandon a thousand years of poetry , "" we are told , "" you should be very certain that you will fare better in prose . ""
In other words , on the Principle of the Dangerous Precedent , nothing should ever be done for the first time .

2011-04-29,"She entered Westminster Abbey as plain Kate Middleton , but emerged as Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge , Countess of Strathearn and Baroness Carrickfergus .
But it was not just the acquisition of the HRH style , the clutch of titles and the slim Wartski gold wedding band on her finger that transformed Prince William 's bride into a future queen .
Before the 1,900 abbey guests , hundreds of thousands on London 's streets and millions watching TV across the planet , the metamorphosis of the middle - class millionaire 's daughter from Middle England to full - time member of "" The Firm "" was complete .
Just as her Grace Kelly - esque gown was said to symbolise the "" opening of a flower "" , Kate – or Catherine , as she is now referred to – blossomed into a fully fledged royal with her polished conduct and bearing on this most important of royal occasions and before a global audience .
There was no fluffing of lines , no trembling of bridal hand – not even when her groom struggled to slip the ring on her finger .
Nerves were betrayed only by a series of small , almost imperceptible , swallows just before she took her vows .
Her curtsey to the Queen at Westminster Abbey , the first time Kate has been seen "" paying obeisance "" to the monarch in public , was flawless despite her 5 ft wedding train .
And the regal wave , much in evidence during the couple 's carriage drive to Buckingham Palace , was coming along nicely .
These are , indeed , auspicious signs .
No wonder the Queen was smiling broadly .
For Kate 's role now is to be royal wife and mother , to renew the House of Windsor , and to showcase Britain around the world .
This was just the start of her new job – indeed her first full - time job .
Soon she will have Canada to conquer on her first royal tour .
Many challenges lie ahead .
Judging from her performance so far , she is perfectly equipped to overcome them .
Long after her wedding , Princess Diana told royal biographer Andrew Morton , therefore broadcasting it to the world , that she felt like a "" lamb to the slaughter "" on the eve of her marriage to Charles . ""
One minute I was nobody , the next minute I was Princess of Wales , mother , media toy , member of this family , you name it , and it was too much for one person at that time , "" she is quoted as saying .
Times have changed , though .
Before Charles and Diana 's wedding they had not even spent a weekend away alone together .
Kate , at 29 one of the oldest royal brides , and William have known each other for a decade .
They cohabit already .
They split up before their marriage , hopefully reducing the odds of them doing so afterwards .
That they instinctively know each other was clear during the strain of the wedding service .
"" You look incredible , beautiful , "" William whispered to Kate as he got his first glimpse of her in bridal gown on the sacrarium steps , surely lessening any nerves .
The two exchanged smiles and glances throughout – he even winked at her at one point .
When they took their vows , the congregation might as well not have been there as they fixed their eyes solely on each other .
At certain moments , William reached for her hand .
When it was their turn to kneel , she managed it elegantly in her show - stopping dress as he helped steady her .
Even "" the kiss "" on Buckingham Palace balcony , duly demanded by the crowd below and undoubtedly dreaded by the couple themselves , was executed with poise .
It was fleeting , quite chaste in fact .
William blushed , reminiscent of his father 's self - consciousness when he had been required to perform "" that caper "" in front of millions 30 years previously .
But when the crowd bayed for more , they obliged before walking hand in hand back through the doors of the palace , with Kate taking one last glimpse over her shoulder at the scene below .
"" A royal family sweeten politics by the seasonable addition of nice and pretty events , "" wrote the 19th - century constitutional expert Walter Bagehot .
This was one such occasion ; a moment of light to pierce the economic gloom .
Royal weddings have long evoked past so - called glories – and not so glorious moments – through centuries - old pomp and pageantry .
They also hint at future possibilities , the promise of another generation and renewal of the ancient institution of the British monarchy .
They provide , too , an opportunity to get the tills jingling , to dust off ceremonial uniforms and customs , pray for sunshine and project Britain around the world . ""
There 's no greater country and better place to be than right here , right now , "" said a morning - suited David Cameron after the ceremony , no doubt delighted at the national distraction from the country 's woes .
The superstitious who believe the House of Windsor to be cursed point to the marriage failures that have beset the Queen 's children as proof .
And , not to chance fate , there were no such declarations as that made during the ceremony 30 years ago by an enthusiastic Robert Runcie , Archbishop of Canterbury , who declared Charles and Diana 's union "" the stuff of fairytales "" .
But for the many thousands who lined the Mall , who camped outside Westminster Abbey , who packed into Trafalgar Square and Hyde Park to be part of the wedding day radiance and romance , they want the ending "" … and they lived happily ever after . """
2011-04-29,"Members of the royal family , friends , foreign dignitaries and royal families from around the world , have begun arriving at Westminster Abbey in London to celebrate the marriage of Prince William , the second in line to the throne , and Kate Middleton .
Thousands of wellwishers have lined the 1.5-mile route to the abbey , which has itself been inundated with tourists watching the arrival of the 1,900 guests since 8:15am .
David and Victoria Beckham , Elton John and David Furnish , and Prince Harry 's friend Chelsy Davy were among those to arrive before 10 am .
William and his brother , Harry , who is his best man , are expected to arrive at 10.15am .
But despite her marriage to the heir to the throne , the bride will not be known as Princess Catherine .
Buckingham Palace announced that William will become the Duke of Cambridge , making Kate the Duchess of Cambridge .
William will also take the titles Earl of Strathearn and Baron Carrickfergus .
An early wedding present from the groom 's grandmother , the Queen , the titles have been given to mark the marriage .
The title of duke links the couple to England , Scotland and Northern Ireland , and is the highest rank in the British peerage .
The wedding will be among the first global news events of the social media age : a service full of pomp and ceremony that has thrust the monarchy to centre stage .
It will also be the most important – and , courtiers hope , positive – event for the future of the monarchy in nearly 30 years .
Middleton , 29 , accompanied by Harry , attended a rehearsal on Thursday at Westminster Abbey , the coronation church for the monarchy since William the Conqueror in 1066 .
In the evening , William , 28 , reached into the crowds waiting on the Mall , shaking hands and telling delighted members of the public he was focusing on "" remembering the lines "" for the "" big day "" .
The Middleton family spent the evening quietly at the Goring hotel near Buckingham Palace , which was cordoned off with a marquee shielding the entrance so that the bride will be able to slip unobserved into one of Buckingham Palace 's Rolls - Royces for her journey to the abbey at precisely 10.51am .
Her dress will not be revealed until she arrives at the abbey nine minutes later .
The designer Sarah Burton , who is creative director for Alexander McQueen , appeared to have entered the hotel in disguise .
The couple issued a statement in an official programme , 150,000 copies of which will be sold for charity in central London , saying they were "" incredibly moved "" by the public 's affection shown them since their engagement .
"" We are both so delighted that you are able to join us in celebrating what we hope will be one of the happiest days of our lives . ""
The wedding ceremony itself – the 15th royal marriage to be celebrated at the abbey since 1100 – will place emphasis on Britishness , with music from three living composers , including a specially commissioned anthem by John Rutter , and music by the Welsh composer Paul Mealor as well as Sir Peter Maxwell Davies .
The abbey has been decorated with an "" avenue of trees "" along the nave made up of eight English field maples and two hornbeams .
It is likely to be cool and cloudy in London for the wedding day , with rain later .
The police and intelligence services have launched an unprecedented security operation as London prepares to celebrate , with an extra 600,000 visitors predicted in the capital .
More than 8,500 journalists and broadcasting staff have arrived to cover the event , more than half of them from foreign news organisations .
Across the country , stocks of bunting were said to have sold out .
In a show of strength to forestall threats of demonstrations and disruption by anarchists , terrorists or extremist groups , Scotland Yard carried out a series of dawn raids across London .
Police with batons and riot gear arrested 20 people during an operation against five squats across the city .
Those arrested were taken to the Paddington Green high security police station and may be detained into the weekend .
Hundreds of Territorial Support Group officers were involved in what the Metropolitan police said was an ongoing operation to investigate suspected criminality linked to disorder at the student demonstration last December and the TUC march last month .
But the action amounted to a controversial pre - emptive strike which the Met said was "" intelligence led "" .
The Labour MP John McDonnell criticised the operation , saying it was "" disproportionate and no way to celebrate this glorious day "" .
For the wedding itself , under huge political pressure from the home secretary and the mayor of London , the Met is mounting one of the biggest security operations in its history , expected to cost £ 20 m , deploying 5,000 officers .
Some 900 uniformed officers will line the route from Westminster Abbey to Buckingham Palace , and undercover units and armed teams are being deployed to deal with a range of threats , from terrorism to direct action by activists .
Thousands of service personnel will also line the procession route .
After the wedding there will be a lunchtime reception for 650 guests at Buckingham Palace , hosted by the Queen , and an obligatory balcony kiss for the newlyweds at 1.25pm – before the monarch and the Duke of Edinburgh head for the country , leaving 300 guests to return for a dinner hosted by Prince Charles in the evening .
Thousands of street parties – including one by anti - monarchists in central London – are planned for this afternoon , though undoubtedly the most publicised will be the one for 90 guests in Downing Street , supervised by Lady Warsi , giving a new dimension to the minister without portfolio 's job description .
Downing Street is being decked with flags and there will be a large screen to allow guests to watch the wedding coverage , a brass band , an ice - cream stall and children 's entertainment ."
2011-04-29,"Whether it was history repeating itself as history , or farce repeating itself as farce , depends entirely on your point of view .
The marriage of His Royal Highness Prince William to Catherine Middleton was washed down by that cocktail of fevered excitement and irate lack of interest that constitutes public opinion these days – so consider it a day when the country split into two , with each side accusing the other of madness .
Much like a standard marital row , in fact .
But along with binge - drinking and misplaced self - regard , royal occasions are something at which Britain is undeniably world class , and anyone still poised for a republic is advised to put down their knitting needles .
As the cameras trained on the Queen 's rather shabby net curtains , awaiting the couple 's balcony kiss , one costumed wellwisher told the BBC the crowds had initially been held back . ""
But in the end , "" she explained , "" the people just pushed the barricades down and rushed towards the palace . ""
And that 's as close to the French Revolution as we 're going to get – a sort of love - storming of the Bastille .
It all read like a recipe for the perfect British day : worries about the weather , lots of mentions of Princess Di , and a chance to talk about the class system .
Even the Germans obliged by having a pop at us , with Der Spiegel 's London correspondent wondering "" why this eccentric nation continues to worship the Windsors "" .
The answer , perhaps , is because there is no quality more English than the country 's ability to suspend its disbelief again and again – be it in the buildup to a World Cup quarter - final , or when faced with the latest iteration of the House of Windsor story .
People know that most of the royal family 's recent marriages have been fairytales .
Grimm .
But something allows the excitement to rebuild , and anyone who begrudged the gazillions who camped out to spend their day cheering and waving flags had a sobering televisual alternative : ITV2 's back - to - back screening of The Only Way is Essex .
As for the marriage ceremony , it was watched by luminaries from the Beckhams to the Bercows to the alleged former head of the Bahraini torture service .
To the left , the king of this ; to the right , the queen of that .
The last time Carole Middleton had to proceed down an aisle this intimidating she was pushing a trolley and uttering the dreaded words ""
I 'm afraid we 've run out of the chicken . ""
But for all the confected snobbery about Kate 's origins , and her black sheep uncle Gary , the bourgeois preoccupations of the buildup could never have withstood the big guns of the occasion .
In truth , there is scarcely a piece of British heritage so vulgar or outrageous that it can not be somehow softened and folded into this most oddly enduring of myths .
During his apprenticeship on Savile Row , the late Alexander McQueen famously sewed "" I AM A CUNT "" into the lining of a suit jacket being made for Prince Charles .
Yet today , the newest member of the House of Windsor was dressed by the house of McQueen , itself renewed dazzlingly by the succession of Sarah Burton .
At Westminster Abbey itself , two establishments fought for prominence .
The Beckhams – who you 'll recall sat on thrones at their own wedding – queued like hoi polloi to get in , while megastar Elton John travelled in steerage at the back of the nave , miles behind various ancient but unidentifiable aristos who have n't been playing with a full order of service since the old king was on the throne .
The telly cameras immediately overrode their protocol function , and were far more interested in cutting to the celebs than any of the more recherché foreign dignitaries .
Thus it was possible to see that neither the Queen nor Victoria Beckham knows the words to Jerusalem off by heart , with both filmed relying intently on their order of service .
Incidentally , we must doff our plastic coronets to the choice of William Blake 's brilliantly mad and mystical hymn of nostalgia for something that never really existed , but which does bring the neck hairs to attention on the big occasion .
The only reading was from Romans . ""
Bless those who persecute you
, "" intoned Kate 's brother James , pausing to allow the reference to the press to sink in . ""
Bless and do not curse them . ""
Most overused phrase of the day ?
""
A very modern love story "" , followed by telly commentators ' dreary emphasis on the fact that William and Kate were "" very down - to - earth people "" , as though all the nation wanted out of a monarchy were a former accessories buyer for Jigsaw and a groom spawned in the hellfires of the House of Windsor , but now merely keen to make his name as a mid - ranking air - sea rescue operative .
The day frequently could n't make its mind up .
On the one hand , loyal subjects were supposed to be impressed that minor royals had foregone horsedrawn carriages and were being shuttled in minibuses .
On the other , they were expected to develop a sudden yet obsessive interest in state arcana – the provenance of gold altar plates , the engraving of a ceremonial bridle , the fact that the Green Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace opens into the White Drawing Room .
We 're all supposed to be semioticians now , so do feel encouraged to speculate on what Prince Harry calling himself "" best man "" as opposed to the more traditional "" supporter "" means for modern Britain , or what Samantha Cameron 's failure to wear a hat means for your local Sure Start centre .
As for what 's next , you need hardly ask .
ITV 's coverage of the wedding kicked off at 0600 hours , and it took all the way until 06.16 before sofa - based royal expert Eve Pollard had declared firmly : "" We want an Olympics baby . ""
So there you have it .
Royal uterus watch begins today ."
2011-04-29,"The protester had only got a few bars into his version of the Beatles ' Yellow Submarine , recast as "" we all live in a fascist regime "" , when the plain clothes officers moved in .
Inside Westminster Abbey , Prince William and Catherine Middleton were exchanging vows watched by millions , but in nearby Soho Square , the expression of different views by a few people met a robust and , according to some present , disproportionate response .
About a dozen policemen grabbed the singer , sparking a clash with his colleagues , changing the mood of a small and peaceful gathering as he was handcuffed and bundled away . ""
He had articles on him to cause criminal damage , "" explained Chief Inspector John Dale , to loud protests .
"" You just incited a peaceful situation into violence , "" shouted a bystander .
"" The police should be peaceful and respect our right to protest , "" said another witness , Jed , 19 .
The action against the 10 or so people participating in the Right Royal Orgy in Soho Square was one of several pre - emptive strikes by Scotland Yard .
Police said they made a total of 52 arrests including 13 at Charing Cross station , where people were found to have climbing equipment and anti - monarchy placards , in addition to 21 arrests during raids of five squats in London on Thursday morning .
Trouble flared at an unofficial street party in Glasgow organised through social networking websites .
Strathclyde police said they made 21 arrests in Kelvingrove Park , for a variety of offences mostly related to disorderly behaviour and drunkenness .
A spokeswoman for the force said : "" Police were aware of this unplanned , unauthorised event and put in place contingencies to ensure an appropriate and proportionate policing response . ""
Chief Superintendent Bernard Higgins , from Strathclyde police , said : "" It 's really disappointing that on the day of the royal wedding we witnessed the scenes we did .
At one point my officers came under attack and one was taken to hospital suffering from a head injury .
He has been discharged and will make a full recovery .
"" We made a number of arrests at the time and we will now study CCTV footage and make further arrests if appropriate .
The level of drunkenness was completely unacceptable and frankly irresponsible . ""
Four people were arrested the night before the wedding , three in London and one in Cambridgeshire , for conspiracy to cause a public nuisance and breach of the peace .
One of them , Chris Knight , was planning to behead an effigy of Prince Andrew with a theatrical guillotine , in what his friends said was a piece of street theatre .
By the time the marriage vows had been made , the police had imposed a section 60 blanket stop - and - search order around the whole royal wedding zone , after a few individuals were seen putting scarves over their faces in Soho Square .
The move allowed officers to search people without discretion .
It can be issued when police believe , with good reason , that there is the possibility of serious violence or that a person is carrying an offensive weapon .
It was imposed along with a section 60a order , which allows officers to remove headgear and masks from demonstrators .
The powers remained in place for several hours , although the police said the mood in both Soho Square and at the Republican Tea Party in Red Lion Square , Holborn , was calm .
Officers also swooped on five people , three of whom were wearing zombie make - up , when they entered a branch of Starbucks on Oxford Street .
They were arrested "" on suspicion of planning a breach of the peace "" .
They were all handcuffed and held in a police van and gave their names as Amy Cutler , 25 , Rachel Young , 27 , Eric Schultz , 43 , Hannah Eisenman - Renyard , and Deborah , 19 , an anthropology student at the University of East London .
"" We 've been pre - emptively arrested under suspicion of planning a breach of the peace , "" Cutler told the Guardian from the police van .
"" We went to Starbucks to get a coffee and the police followed us in . ""
"" We were just dressing up as zombies , "" said Amy , who was wearing a "" marry me instead "" T - shirt .
"" It is nice to dress up as zombies . ""
The decision to arrest people on Thursday in advance of them carrying out any protest drew an angry response from their friends and relatives .
In Cambridgeshire officers arrested Charlie Veitch , an anarchist , for conspiracy to cause a public nuisance and breach of the peace .
His girlfriend , Silkie Carlo , said Veitch had been planning to use a megaphone to make "" ironic comments "" in Soho Square .
"" I 'm outraged .
It 's easy to hide all this behind the beauty and the spectacle and the tiaras of the wedding , but when people with opposing political ideas are being rounded up to keep them away from public view it does n't make us any different from China , "" she said .
In London the daughter of Chris Knight , who was arrested with his partner and a friend , said the police were quashing freedom of expression .
Olivia Knight said : "" My father was going to take part in a performance .
It was going to be in the great British tradition and was going to be playful , peaceful and satirical to highlight the obscenity of the royal wedding and the grotesque nature of the taxpayer having to pay for the Windsor wedding at a time of such austerity . ""
The Metropolitan police brushed off any criticism .
Assistant Commissioner Lynne Owens , in overall charge of the policing operation , said it had been "" an amazing success "" .
It justified the police 's preemptive action in the days and hours before the wedding and the decision to throw a Section 60 Stop and Search Order around the whole wedding zone .
The Yard said the police action had allowed the demonstrations in Soho Square and Holborn to go on freely ."
2011-04-30,"William First Name William .
Wills , the Willster , Willy - boy .
More like William Arthur Philip Louis .
Surname ?
Of Wales .
That 's not a name , it 's a place .
Top royals do n't really have surnames , just titles .
They do n't need second names as everyone knows who they are .
Like Madonna … or Prince !
Sort of .
But William actually is a prince .
Originally the family name was Saxe - Coburg - Gotha , but it was changed to Windsor in 1917 .
Why ?
The original one sounded a bit too German for a monarchy in charge of a country that was , at the time , rather awkwardly embroiled in bloody trench warfare with Germany .
So should we really call him Wilhelm ?
Nein .
Britain has been importing royals from Germany since the 18th century .
George I – aka Ludwig – did n't speak a word of English , but the family has integrated a bit since then .
William 's mother was a proper English rose .
Is that possible ?
A child born to a man and a flower ?
Funny you should ask .
Pater Charles is a keen horticulturalist , but those relations are almost exclusively platonic .
This English Rose was a beautiful young lady called Diana .
Oh yes , the Princess of Hearts ?
The very same .
And legend tells how the boy William inherited her good looks , easy charm , gentle manner , charitable impulses , common touch .
And from his father he got ?
A bald patch .
Unlucky !
Not really , he also gets a crown to cover it up and a kingdom .
Of course .
Wales And the rest : England , Scotland , Northern Ireland and a bunch of Commonwealth realms .
And France ?
No , not France .
But Henry V …
Agincourt … "" once more unto the breach , dear friends !
"" Was the 100 years war fought in vain ?
Yes , move on .
So when does William get this kingdom ?
He is second in line to the throne , which means his gran and his dad have to die before he can be king .
Could n't he , y'know , speed things up a bit ?
That 's sometimes how they did it in days of yore , but foul regicidal usurpation is now frowned upon in polite circles .
What does he do in the meantime ?
He is a flight lieutenant in the RAF search - and - rescue squadron .
And there 's lots of charity work .
Then there 's playing polo , opening things , launching things .
Watching association football matches ( he loves the Villa , of course , the claret and blues )
…
er , you know , princely duties .
Is n't that a bit risky ?
Young man , time on his hands , surrounded by glamorous women .
Surely , you 're not insinuating that a future monarch would be capable of marital infidelity ? !
Only in days of yore , perhaps .
Well , William 's namesake and great - great - great - great - great - grand - uncle , King William IV , was a bit of a ladies ' man and had a ton of illegitimate children .
What happened to them ?
Nothing much .
His great - great - great - great - great grandson is some obscure ne'er - do - well called David Cameron .
Catherine First names .
Catherine Elizabeth .
Of , er , Berkshire .
That 's not a kingdom .
So she has a surname ?
She had one before the wedding : Middleton .
That does n't sound very royal .
It 's not ; she 's a commoner .
There 's no need to be rude .
Commoner just means she is n't a member of the nobility .
Got it .
Ordinary Kate .
Plain old Katie .
Girl next door .
Well , she grew up in a posh village and went to a posh prep school , and then to a posh public school .
Yep , got it .
An ' umble lass , but maybe with long - forgotten blue blood , like Tess of the D'Urbervilles .
Actually her family are really quite rich .
Salt - of - the - earth Kate .
It 's a right royal fairytale , is n't it ?
Like Cinderella going to the ball and winning Prince Charming with her glass slippers .
Except that they met at St Andrews , and she won the prince by wearing a see - through dress in a fashion show .
Times change .
It 's still a fairytale .
She 's unmistakably upper - middle class .
Whatever .
Fairytale .
Rumour has it
she had a picture of William on her wall at boarding school .
OK , that 's a bit weird .
New money , you say ?
Brand new .
Her parents made a pile selling children 's party accessories .
A couple of generations back , the family on her mother 's side were coal miners from County Durham .
So what first attracted her to the second in line to the throne of the United Kingdom ?
Who knows ?
Must have been fate – star - crossed lovers , Romeo and Juliet , Tristan and Isolde , Antony and Cleopatra
…
…
Jordan and Peter ?
Hardly appropriate .
A common girl called Katie who fancies being a princess …
The parallels end there .
She likes horses .
Enough .
Catherine Middleton is a stylish , elegant , sophisticated young lady whose relatively ordinary background will rejuvenate the British monarchy .
She will be like a breath of fresh air .
Is n't that what they said about Fergie ?
Some breaths turn out to be fresher than others .
But Kate Middleton is the real deal .
She 's minty fresh .
So it was love at first sight for the pair of them ?
More like friends at early sight , followed by housemates , and then sort of boyfriend - girlfriend , then splitting up , then friends again , then getting back together .
I do n't remember that fairytale .
You mean you were never read the story of "" Waity Katy "" , the girl who was kept hanging on ?
Remind me .
She waited for , like , 100 years for the handsome prince to ask her to marry him .
And when he finally did , a wicked witch called Camilla cast a spell on him and he turned into his dad and was n't handsome any more .
Sounds a bit tragic .
But she does get to be a princess in the end ?
Not yet .
But she does get to be the Duchess of Cambridge , thanks to her new grandma - in - law , who has just given her the title .
She could be a Princess of Hearts
… Do n't go there !"
2011-04-30,"Prince William , in a surprise break from the schedule , borrowed his father 's 41-year - old open - topped Aston Martin to pootle down the Mall to Clarence House with his new bride .
The car was a 21st birthday present to Prince Charles from his mother in 1969 and , like many middle - aged men 's sports cars , it spends most of its life these days in the garage , used only occasionally for jaunts around the country lanes of Gloucestershire and doing only a couple of hundred miles a year .
It has , however , impeccably green credentials in contrast to most 1960 sports cars , having been converted to run on bioethanol fuel â€ “ and not just any old bioenthanol but converted from surplus British wine .
So it runs on plonk â€ “ all part of Charles 's green initiatives : his other cars , Jaguars , an Audi and a Range Rover have all been converted to run on used cooking fat ."
2011-04-30,"Television audiences for the royal wedding on BBC1 and ITV1 peaked at more than 24 million , according to figures released by the broadcasters .
The vast bulk of the audience share was between 11 am and 12.15pm on Friday as Prince William and Kate Middleton took their vows in the service at Westminster Abbey .
BBC1 , BBC1 HD and the BBC News channel attracted 19.2 million people during that period , representing 67.2 % of the audience share .
ITV1 said its coverage , hosted by Julie Etchingham and Phillip Schofield , attracted 5.9 million during the same period , giving the corporation a 3 - 1 win in the race for ratings .
The audience figures place the wedding in the upper rankings of the most - watched TV broadcasts in the UK , although it was still behind the audiences for the funeral of Prince Diana and the 1966 World Cup final between England and West Germany .
Earlier in the day , 9.4 million on average had watched BBC coverage fronted by Huw Edwards between 8 am and 11 am , with 17.5 million watching in the last 15 minutes of that period .
There was an average of 16.6 million viewers for BBC1 between 12.15pm and the news at 1.45pm , a spokesperson for the corporation said .
Viewing figures for BBC Television , including BBC1 , the BBC News Channel and BBC HD , showed the audience peaked at 19.79 million â€ “ a 70.6 % audience share .
Across the BBC as a whole , a total of 34.7 million people tuned in to watch some part of the royal wedding .
More than a million people used BBC iPlayer to watch the coverage .
Mark Byford , the BBC 's Deputy Director - General , said : "" The huge audience of so many millions who shared the day with the BBC is a testament to all those involved in producing such high - quality and distinctive coverage , and proves once again that the BBC is the broadcaster of choice for audiences during big national events .
"" There was a peak of 6.1 million viewers watching the coverage on ITV1 as the service began , according to a spokesman for the broadcaster .
Peter Fincham , ITV director of television , said : "" We are delighted that more than six million viewers were watching ITV as the royal wedding ceremony got under way and are very pleased that the audience increasingly chose to stay with us during the afternoon , which also reflects the fantastic feedback we have had about our coverage .

He was appointed a guardian of Prince William after Diana died , and yet came two minutes before Elton John , who preceded by some seconds the home secretary , Theresa May.
Which guest were we to judge the big cheese here ?
More baffling still , the Beckhams arrived nearly 30 minutes earlier , even though they were technically the most famous people there .
At 8.33am the BBC reported that "" perhaps surprisingly , it 's first come , first served in the abbey "" , which would explain a certain readiness to queue and the unfashionable promptness of normally modish guests such as Rowan Atkinson , Guy Ritchie , Ian "" Thorpedo "" Thorpe , Ben Fogle and Joss Stone .
This was not any old crowd , where you could get to the front with sharp elbows and a bagful of attitude .
There were alleged torturers there and all sorts .
Well , one alleged torturer .
We will come to him later , pausing first to note the proliferation of Tories .
Theresa May was just the beginning : après elle , l'unbelievable déluge .
All the talk the day before the wedding was of why Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were not invited , while Lady Thatcher and Major were cordially welcomed .
Jack Straw thought it was a straight oversight .
The palace offered some lame excuse about the former Labour PMs not being Knights of the Garter .
Surely space was n't a consideration , since Lady Thatcher did n't go anyway .
If we 'd known then what we know now – that there would be not just ex - prime ministers but loads of middle - ranking and even minor Tories peppered across the abbey , and it would in fact look more like Lady Thatcher 's funeral than the wedding of two nice young people , we would have been even more perplexed .
Ken Clarke was so close to the action that when the choirboys did their descant , it looked as though it was coming from him , and he had a surprisingly high , sweet voice .
John Bercow was there , which is perhaps explicable by the fact that Mrs B could get herself invited into a papal conclave if she set her mind to it .
But Jeremy Hunt ?
Seriously ?
Sam Cam looked terrific in Burberry .
Cameron himself , after all that fuss about his suit ( morning ? lounge ? ) , has turned into one of those men who makes any attire look like pyjamas .
Nick Clegg looked way too hot .
However , as Conservative - studded as it was , the list of British dignitaries was not the controversial one :
I know it 's déclassé to mention it , and they disinvited Syria , and is that not enough for you human - rights - abuse killjoys ?
But there was a small knot of quasi - despots , striking an indelicate note despite the fact that they arrived quietly and did not draw attention to themselves by wearing taffeta or florals : the royals of Oman and Saudi Arabia and , most controversially , Bahranian ambassador Sheikh Khalifa Bin Ali al - Khalifa , who previously headed a ministry known informally in the country as the torture service .
Some unspoken rule of the day , however , meant that cameras obligingly looked away as they arrived ; either that , or they arrived in the dead of night , wearing huge , furry hoods .
Other guests were most certainly there , but invisible to the naked television : naughty Uncle Gary ( on Kate 's side ) was seen leaving his house in a blue Rolls - Royce Phantom , but no one saw him arrive .
Besides anything else , where did he park ?
The visible friends of the couple all had a charity bent : the head of the Tusk Trust , the chairman of Mountain Rescue , the chief executive of Fields In Trust .
Useful people when you are about to go on a long journey and you want to make sure the environmental third - sector infrastructure is in place , but not obvious candidates for a knees - up .
Where were the St Andrews lot ?
The Mahiki crowd ?
( This is a fabulous London cocktail bar , since you ask , on Dover Street .
It is not that hard to get in , you just have to not mind that all the drinks cost £ 1 m . )
They were there , is the short answer , but cameras had been asked to steer clear .
The official rule for the day was : "" If in doubt – could be torturer , chewing gum , dress too low - cut , hair like Phil Mitchell – cut back to Princess Beatrice . ""
I saw her outfit so many times , I could recreate the hat with a cheese string .
Of course , by the time the family arrived there was space for everyone and no scrum .
Inexplicably , both families – apart from the parents – were transported in minibuses .
They looked like cabin crew .
I say that not to make a snobbish dig at Carole Middleton 's flight - attendant past , but because they really did .
But ah , bless .
There 's Kate in the car , beginning her waving career with a tentative , strangely angled motion .
It 's not the best but she has the next 50 years to tinker with it .
You know it 's a big day when you get to arrive after the Queen .
It was hard not to smile when the last car pulled up ."
2011-05-01,"The ink is barely dry on the wedding register but already the game of cat and mouse between the press and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge is well and truly on .
Royal sources have told the Guardian that Prince William 's decision to return to work as a search and rescue helicopter pilot in Anglesey this week instead of heading to a honeymoon beach with his bride was long planned .
The media had previously been led to believe the couple would take a fortnight 's holiday shortly after Friday 's wedding at Westminster Abbey .
It seemed to be a classic piece of mis - direction intended to keep their honeymoon secret and a senior aide said the decision to delay the break had nothing to do with security fears in the Middle East , as was reportedon Sunday .
Jordan had been mooted as a possible destination .
"" We do n't tend to do things last minute at the palace and we would n't have taken any risks with their security anyway , "" the aide said .
"" We are concerned to keep their destination private . ""
That extended to their British mini - break , which began at 11.15am on Saturday when the newlyweds flew from Buckingham Palace to an unknown location in the UK in the Queen 's Sikorsky S-76C Spirit .
The Scilly Isles and Balmoral were touted as possible boltholes .
Their Macavity - like departure set the tone for a couple who are said to be keen to avoid the full glare of publicity in the early months of their marriage .
It also left room for their wedding guests back in London to pick over the bones of the wedding â€ “ the winners and losers , the spats and the love - ins which followed a service that David Cameron said was "" absolutely beautiful , gripping , moving "" .
Tales from the eight - hour party at Buckingham Palace on Friday night began to circulate .
Prince William , it was reported , introduced his new wife in a speech as "" Mrs Wales "" while Prince Harry referred to his brother and sister - in - law as "" the dude "" and "" the duchess "" .
The pair began the dancing under glitterballs in what one onlooker judged to be a "" twirly "" performance .
No well - to - do wedding would be complete without the presence of John Lewis , and so it was apt that the duke and duchess stepped out to a live rendition of the retailer 's tear - jerking Christmas advert tune : Ellie Goulding 's cover of Elton John 's Your Song .
The 25-year - old singer went on to perform versions of Bryan Adams 's Summer Of ' 69 and Stevie Wonder 's Superstition before DJs played Tinie Tempah 's Pass Out and
Bodyrockers ' I Like The Way You Move .
Few did pass out and even Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall apparently kept going past midnight .
On Saturday , the bride 's younger sister , Philippa , hit the headlines as "" her royal hotness "" after her appearance as maid of honour in a figure - hugging dress .
Already a well - connected party planner , her transformation into a star at the wedding looks set to boost her fortunes further .
Less welcome might be the Pippa Middleton Ass Appreciation Society page on Facebook , which has already beenhad been "" liked "" by almost 90,000 people .
Estimates in the Sunday papers suggested the Middletons may have laid out Â£250,000 during the wedding on dresses , suits , jewellery , hotel rooms and food , drink and parties for friends , although that did not account for the possibility of discounts from suppliers , such as the Goring Hotel and fashion company Alexander McQueen , which enjoyed publicity throughout the wedding that money could not buy .
There was speculation , too , about the business aspirations of the bride 's brother , James Middleton , 23 , who registered three companies in weeks running up to the wedding :
Nice Wine , Nice Cakes and Nice Group London .
Other winners included Sarah Burton , the wedding dress designer who joined Alexander McQueen as a student intern and won almost universal praise for her chantilly lace and satin creation .
"" This will open up further avenues for McQueen and it may open up the possibility of her own label , "" said Sukeena Rao , a style consultant .
"" Women who may not have considered it before may start to look at the brand .
She could n't have got it more spot on .
"" Burton 's name had already been mentioned in connection with the top post at Christian Dior , vacated after John Galliano was sacked in March for alleged antisemitic remarks .
In the aftermath of the wedding , no aspect of the day was left unexamined .
Lipreaders continued their trawl over who said what in the abbey , revealing that the Duchess of Cornwall remarked "" it all looks very posh "" .
Perhaps it was , compared with her own wedding to Prince Charles in Windsor town hall in 2005 .
The Mail on Sunday revealed it had obtained the 744 horseshoes worn by the steeds of the Household Cavalry , presumably including the one that bolted , and is offering them to readers as mementos .
Political commentator Dominic Lawson even advanced a new theory about the absence of Gordon Brown and Tony Blair : royal revenge because the former decommissioned the royal yacht Britannia when chancellor and the latter banned fox hunting as prime minister , which displeased the Duchess of Cornwall .
The ghost of Diana lingered .
Jemima Khan , daughter of Lady Annabel Goldsmith , a close friend of Princess Diana who was not invited , tweeted during the ceremony : "" No offence to Camilla but I 'd have preferred â€ “ out of respect â€ “ that no one had substituted for mother of the groom at register signing .
"" That fuelled talk of a rather aristocratic spat between the families over the lack of invitations .
The feelgood factor generated by the wedding was even enumerated in a YouGov poll , which showed that 78 % of people think William and Kate will overshadow the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall .
In the face of widespread public warmth about the event , republicans took solace .
"" They are facing a problem of their own making , "" said Graham Smith , director of anti - monarchy group Republic .
"" They would do well for the Queen and Prince Charles to stand aside , but they ca n't do that .
William will go back to work this week and the attention returns to the old guard . ""
He said membership of his group had more than doubled to 15,000 in the five months leading up to the wedding and that 1,000 people came to a Republican street party in London on Friday .
His group has some way to go yet ."
2011-05-04,"The royal wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge left America mesmerised , President Obama has told the Prince of Wales .
The US president said he was impressed by how Prince William and his new wife Kate handled the pressure of the big day in an informal meeting with the groom 's father in the Oval Office of the White House .
The president joked with Charles that he could not have coped with such a huge ceremony himself – he had 300 guests at his wedding to Michelle .
The Obamas were not present at the wedding at Westminster Abbey in London on Friday but his comments suggested he watched at least some of the event .
The meeting came at the end of a two - day visit by Charles to Washington .
The two men last saw each other in France during the 65th anniversary commemorations for the D - Day landings , and earlier that year had chatted at Buckingham Palace during a reception for world leaders attending a G20 summit in London .
Their conversation turned to the military and Charles described how his son Prince Harry was getting to grips with the difficult task of flying the Apache helicopter .
The president sympathised and said piloting the complicated machines was suited to the "" iPod generation "" .
The heir to the throne also revealed to the president how he worried for Harry when he was in Afghanistan .
The prince served for 10 weeks as a forward air controller in Helmand Province from 2007 - 08 ."

2011-05-09,"The Middleton family has complained to the Press Complaints Commission after five - year - old photographs of Kate and Pippa Middleton and their mother , Carole , in bikinis while on holiday with Prince William on board a yacht off Ibiza were published in four newspapers .
The pictures , in the Mail on Sunday , Daily Mail , News of the World and Daily Mirror showed the Middletons swimming , diving and sunbathing .
The News of the World also showed Pippa Middleton removing her bikini top with the headlines ""
Oh buoy it 's Pippa "" and "" So hot she had to be hosed down . ""
Further photographs were displayed for a time on the newspaper 's website but later taken down .
Although the photographs were taken in 2006 , the Mail on Sunday described them as "" never - before - seen pictures "" .
The News of the World claimed its pictures from the same set were exclusive , showing the then 22-year - old Pippa Middleton 's "" now world - famous rear admirable , afloat here in never - before - seen detail "" .
The pictures were sourced from the London - based Big Pictures Agency .
The PCC said it had received a complaint , which it was now considering .
Sources at the PCC indicated the complaint was on the grounds that the pictures breach the editors ' code of practice by invading the Middletons ' reasonable expectation of privacy .
Publication of the photographs follows pictures in three tabloids last Friday showing the Duchess of Cambridge wheeling a shopping trolley at the local Waitrose supermarket on Anglesey , where she and Prince William live in RAF quarters .
Separate photographers received bylines in each paper , indicating she may have been confronted by a group .
Newspapers have been warned not to identify the couple 's home for security reasons .
Prince William 's role in rescuing a retired judge , who suffered a heart attack while walking on Snowdon at the weekend , has also been publicised ."
2011-05-09,"Two Sunday newspapers yesterday published pictures of Kate Middleton and her sister Pippa , in company with their mother , Carole , and Prince William , aboard a yacht moored off Ibiza .
They were taken in 2006 .
The seven photographs , published across two pages of the Mail on Sunday under the headline Perfect Pippa - and the Prince of Belly Flops , showed the sisters , both wearing bikinis , while swimming , diving and sun - bathing .
Their mother was also shown in a bikini .
The News of the World carried two shots from the same set on its front page with the headline ""
Oh buoy it 's Pippa ... and she 's topless inside "" .
There were six pictures on an inside spread - headlined "" So hot she had to be hosed down ! ""
- with one showing Pippa in the act of removing her bikini top .
It also urged readers to visit its website to "" see more photos of Pippa sunbathing . ""
These were available for a time ( there were links to them from Google and Facebook ) but have since been taken down .
The story has also been removed from the paper 's site .
Why ?
Well , it could have something to do with the paper becoming aware of the fact that the Middleton family are very likely to make a formal complaint to the Press Complaints Commission about the use of the pictures .
They are expected to argue that publication of these five - year - old images breaches the editors ' code of practice by invading the privacy of the Middleton daughters and their mother .
As a family enjoying a holiday aboard a private yacht moored in a discreet location off a foreign island they had "" a reasonable expectation of privacy .
"" Then there will be questions about how the pictures were obtained .
For example , did the photographer ( or photographers ) engage in "" persistent pursuit "" in order to shoot them ?
If a complaint is made to the PCC , evidence about their provenance will probably be sought from the papers ' editors and from the London - based agency credited with selling them , Big Pictures .
Clearly , the NoW 's use of a topless shot will be considered more intrusive .
But does that really mean the MoS is less guilty ?
My guess is that the papers will counter that some of these pictures were published years ago and , since there was no complaint at the time , then it 's a bit rich for the family to worry now .
Then again , as the Mail on Sunday online headline says , they show the Middleton clan in never - before - seen pictures .
Even if other shots from the same set were published without complaint , these are new images as far as the public is concerned .
Indeed , over the years , it 's possible that lots of candid paparazzi shots of Kate Middleton and her family were taken and never published , but they are held on file .
The family probably feel that they need to deal with this matter rapidly in order to prevent yet more pictures from emerging .
There were also up - to - date pictures of Kate ( aka the Duchess of Cambridge ) published in the three best - selling tabloids last Friday .
They showed her pushing a shopping trolley outside a Waitrose supermarket in Anglesey .
There were separate bylines for the photographers in The Sun , the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror .
So she was obviously faced by a pack rather than a single pap .
I understand that there will not be a complaint to the PCC about the pictures - which were published across the world , particularly in the US - because it is felt that it was something of a one - off to mark her first informal appearance in public after the wedding .
But should the paps start gathering in Anglesey then I imagine the PCC might well get involved in order to advise editors against publishing similar shots because of possible harassment ."
2011-05-10,"The Duchess of York said that although she found it difficult to cope with not being invited to the royal wedding she is n't bitter about being snubbed and takes solace in the fact that Prince William 's mother was also absent .
"" I really love the feeling that sort of Diana and I both were n't there , "" said Sarah Ferguson in a television interview with Oprah Winfrey , during which Prince Andrew 's former wife suggested that there was no one to blame but herself for her lack of an invitation .
"" I felt that I ostracised myself by my behaviour , by the past , by living with all the regrets of my mistakes , that I sort of wore a hair shirt and beat myself up most of the day thinking why did I make such a mistake , "" said the duchess , who was filmed offering an undercover reporter access to her former husband for Â£500,000 last year .
In the interview , to be broadcast in the US today , she said that it was "" so difficult "" for her to cope with not being invited that she spent 29 April in Thailand .
She said the Duke of York , who accompanied their daughters , Beatrice , 22 , and Eugenie , 21 , to Westminster Abbey , made her feel part of the occasion by talking "" all morning "" to her on the telephone .
Asked how hurt she felt by the snub , the 51-year - old former royal replied : "" It was so difficult .
Because I wanted to be there with my girls â€ ¦ and to be getting them dressed and to go as a family .
And it was also hard because the last bride up that aisle was me . ""
Of her former husband , she said : "" He was saying , ' It 's okay .
Just remember we had such a good day .
Our wedding was so perfect ' .
Because we 're such a unit together .
He made me feel very part of the day on April the 29th . ""
"" I think what I felt was that I went through the phase of feeling so totally worthless and that [ it ] was quite right
they did n't invite me , "" added the duchess , who is to have a show on Winfrey 's new cable station , when asked if she felt rejected .
The duchess said she believed Prince William 's mother would have been "" so proud of her son "" , and added : "" But I 'm here to say how proud she would have been and Kate looked utterly beautiful . ""
Promotional clips on the Oprah Winfrey website claim that in the interview , filmed in Chicago , the duchess 's daughters will "" break their silence "" .
Winfrey also asks about her close relationship with her former husband , saying : "" Why do n't you get married again ? """
2011-05-11,"Few things happen on Anglesey these days without the national media being informed , so when two cars , including a police Range Rover piled high with luggage , were seen being driven off the island on Monday afternoon it was a fair bet that Prince William and his duchess were finally starting their honeymoon , 10 days after the royal wedding .
Herewith starts the latest game of cat and mouse – with the couple the mice and the pursuing moggies , laden with cameras , trying to spot which particular hole they are bolting for .
The Seychelles seems the winner .
It 's nice at this time of year , especially in a £ 4,000 a night beach hotel .
But events over the past few days indicate the paparazzi may not have things all their own way .
A shot has already been aimed across their path with an official complaint by the Middleton family over publication of five - year - old photographs showing Kate Middleton and her younger sister , Pippa – and their mother , Carole – in bikinis relaxing on board a yacht while on holiday with William and others off Ibiza in 2006 .
They are eerily reminiscent of Princess Diana 's last holiday with Dodi Fayed on a yacht in 1997 .
The pictures , supplied by a London freelance agency , are grainy , long - distance and clearly unauthorised and some have apparently been published before , but what has given them special resonance now with the tabloids – the News of the World , Mail on Sunday , Daily Mail and Daily Mirror
published them – is that they include not just Kate Middleton , but also Pippa , who has become a sudden media star since wearing That Dress as bridesmaid at That Wedding .
If one "" wisteria sister "" has married her prince , the second now also climbs into the sunlight .
Even her bottom has its own appreciative website .
What prompted the Middletons ' complaint about the invasion of their privacy was not the lubricious commentary about Pippa 's "" now world - famous rear admirable "" but probably the News of the World 's decision to push things too far by publishing a picture showing a silhouette of one of her breasts as she took off her bikini top .
The newspapers all trumpeted that their pictures were exclusive , or "" never seen before "" , which may prove a strategic mistake , especially if they subsequently claim that , as pictures from the yacht party have been published before without complaint , they have not intruded into the family 's privacy now .
It is difficult to have it both ways .
The fact that Pippa , who was 22 then and is 27 now , was not the focus of attention in those days is no excuse : she still has a right to privacy , particularly if the yacht was discreetly positioned .
The Press Complaints Commission was insisting yesterday that the Middletons have as much right to a private life as any other members of the public – "" the same as everybody else , from prince to commoner , in terms of their expectation of privacy "" – but , of course , the Middletons are no longer just anybody , just as William was not any old student when the papers respected his privacy as a student at Eton , then St Andrews .
The PCC has been quietly protecting them for some time , though it would hate to admit it and has only occasionally broken cover .
Editors regularly get quiet letters of prior restraint and pointed reminders of the journalists ' code of practice , which prohibits "" persistence in questioning , telephoning , pursuing or photographing individuals once asked to desist , nor remaining on their property when asked to leave and must not follow them "" .
By and large that has meant that pictures such as one of Kate Middleton on a tennis court and another of her at a family Christmas , taken through a window , have not seen the light of day in Britain .
On the one previous occasion that a formal complaint was lodged , against the Daily Mirror in March 2007 after it published a photograph of her in the street carrying a cup of coffee , the paper published a grovelling mea culpa , or in the PCC 's terms "" a prompt , public expression of regret and admission of error "" .
Its editor , Richard Wallace , said then , only slightly querulously : "" We published an innocuous picture of Miss Middleton walking down the street with a cup of coffee .
It was taken by a freelance photographer in circumstances where we were later told she felt harassed .
We got it wrong and we sincerely regret that . ""
But even in the past few weeks there have been other informal complaints .
On 7 April , Carole and Pippa told the PCC that they had been harassed while out shopping in London by agency photographers riding mopeds , and even on the morning of the wedding itself the PCC was recording its satisfaction that the Daily Mail had withdrawn inaccurate references to James Middleton , Kate 's brother , from a story on its website .
The old strapline that the Sun likes to put on its exclusives to warn off rivals , "" Our lawyers are watching "" , springs to mind .
It is not only the press that likes to have its cake and eat it , however : no complaint has been received about pictures published in several papers last Friday showing Kate Middleton pushing a shopping trolley in the carpark outside the Anglesey Waitrose – pictures taken by several photographers according to the bylines .
Was the calculation that they were taken in a public place , or that they happily conveyed the fiction that the duchess is really just a services ' wife who knows all about doing the weekly shopping while her husband is hard at work rescuing walkers taken ill on Snowdonia ?
If so , that may be a step on from Princess Diana 's early experience of married life in 1981 when she was photographed popping out to the shops to buy some sweets .
The Queen called in editors to make a quiet plea for her daughter - in - law 's privacy , only to be asked by Barry Askew , the editor of the News of the World , why they did n't just send out a servant to buy them ? ""
That was a pompous remark Mr Askew , "" Her Majesty remarked and he was ousted within weeks .
Thirty years on , both sides are more savvy – but do n't expect the media 's fascination to be too constrained .
However remote the honeymoon is , if there is a good enough picture there will be buyers somewhere ."
2011-05-19,"The Queen is clearly enjoying what will probably be remembered as one of the happiest few weeks of her 59 year reign .
On 29 April the wedding of Prince William to Kate Middleton assured the Queen that the monarchy will be in safe hands for decades to come .
Next week she will welcome Barack Obama on his first state visit to Britain .
And this week the Queen has set the seal on the full normalisation of Anglo - Irish relations .
The warm response to her speech at a state banquet at Dublin Castle on Wednesday night showed that the Queen is pulling off one of the most successful state visits of her reign .
Even Gerry Adams lauded the Queen for her "" genuine "" expression of sympathy for victims of Ireland 's troubled past .
As an Irish republican leader , Adams probably never thought he would praise a British monarch .
But the Queen 's four day visit is clearly of immense symbolic significance in showing that Britain and Ireland are , as she said in her speech , "" more than just neighbours "" .
The most significant moment came on the first day of her visit on Tuesday when the Queen bowed her head in respect to those who died for Irish independence after laying a wreath at the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin .
This can not have been easy for the Queen who knew that she was honouring those who inspired the murderers of Prince Philip 's uncle , Earl Mountbatten of Burma , in 1979 .
Only a handful of people know what was in the Queen 's mind that day .
But she is understood to show a deep – and some say an amusingly anorak – level of interest in the Northern Ireland peace process .
She will therefore have known that her gesture will be remembered for many decades by nationalist Ireland .
But there will probably have been one overriding thought in her mind : duty .
Successive British governments have long felt that relations between London and Dublin will only be fully normalised once the Queen has paid a full state visit .
If Angela Merkel , Barack Obama and Nicolas Sarkozy bow their heads at the Garden of Remembrance then so too will Britain 's head of state , goes the thinking .
But the Queen has done more than turn up and bow at the right moments .
She clearly impressed her audience at Dublin Castle .
Mary McAleese , the Irish president , exclaimed "" wow "" twice after the Queen opened her speech in Irish with the words : A Uachtaráin agus a chairde .
[ President and friends . ]
At the end of her speech the president said : Thank you so much .
The Queen , who had asked the audience to toast the president and the people of Ireland , said : I like these clinking glasses .
The visit will have a lasting impact in Northern Ireland .
One element of the visit that has been overlooked is how the visit is playing well in both communities :
• Unionists were uneasy when the Queen paid her respects to what one described to me as "" nasty people "" at the Garden of Remembrance .
But they like the idea of the Queen visiting the Irish Republic on a state visit –
it shows that the 26 counties are foreign soil .
•
Sinn Féin is officially protesting against the visit and has been displaying on its website the famous republican declaration : "" We serve neither King nor Kaiser but Ireland . ""
But , as I blogged on Monday , Adams wrote in the Irish Examiner at the weekend that the visit would give him great "" pleasure "" if it leads to a better relationship between Britain and Ireland .
He did n't quite say it
but Adams is happy because the visit marks the first time in centuries that a British monarch is standing on Irish soil as a foreigner .
The banquet also showed that Sinn Féin is now fully part of the establishment on both sides of the border .
There were no representatives of the party of the dinner – because they asked not to be invited .
Peter Robinson , Northern Ireland 's Democratic Unionist first minister , did attend ."
2011-05-23,"Moses Peter has a variety of waves in his repertoire .
His stock wave is a slow , noble - looking one involving the whole right arm , palm forward , fingers close together .
For youngsters he tends to waggle his hand vigorously , like Prince William 's surprisingly childlike wave at the royal wedding .
And from time to time the wave is more of a pointing to the sky as if he has just spotted something very significant there .
For seven years Moses has been running through his repertoire on the seafront road between Torquay and Paignton in Devon .
Carrying a black staff , he walks up and down the A3022 or sits on a bench or the sea wall and waves at the passing traffic .
Moses has become something of a cult figure , and the subject of a Facebook page , "" Strange Old Man
Who Sits On A Bench On The Road "" .
He is variously described as a white wizard , as Merlin , Neptune or as Torbay 's "" gentle shepherd "" .
There have been calls for him to stand for mayor and to turn the Christmas lights on – appropriate , as his long white hair , beard and flowing robes have prompted many a child to think he is Santa Claus .
Now , however , Moses is feeling threatened .
There have been complaints that his waving is distracting drivers and the hooting of car horns that his waving prompts is breaching the peace , not to mention disturbing the afternoon naps of the many elderly people who stay in the hotels that line Moses 's mile - long route .
The police have spoken to him and appealed for motorists not to toot their horns .
"" I ca n't stop them doing that , "" says Moses .
"" I 'm just an old man doing what I do , trying to spread a little bit of happiness . ""
Moses says he began to wave after bumping into a man who asked him where the first seed for the first tree came from .
"" That set me thinking . . .
what 's it all about ? ""
Others might have turned to organised religion but Moses started waving at traffic .
He thinks of his waves as "" little presents "" . ""
I throw them out at the people as they pass .
They catch them and throw a present back .
That 's all . ""
It seems wrong to distract him any longer with conversation .
He says goodbye and gives one of his waves – one of the long , noble ones .
And , sure enough , it does feel rather nice ."
2011-06-08,"Pressure is building on the Metropolitan police to expand their phone - hacking inquiry to include a notorious private investigator who was accused in the House of Commons on Wednesday of targeting politicians , members of the royal family and high - level terrorist informers on behalf of Rupert Murdoch 's News International .
Guardian inquiries reveal that the former prime minister Tony Blair is among the suspected victims of Jonathan Rees , who was involved in the theft of confidential data , the hacking of computers and , it is alleged , burglary .
According to close associates of Rees , he also targeted : •
Jack Straw when he was home secretary , Peter Mandelson when he was trade secretary and Blair 's media adviser Alastair Campbell ; • Prince Edward and the Countess of Wessex , and the Duke and Duchess of Kent , all of whom are said to have had their bank accounts penetrated , and Kate Middleton
when she was Prince William 's girlfriend ;
•
The former commissioner of the Metropolitan police , Sir John Stevens , and the current assistant commissioner , John Yates , who later supervised the failed phone - hacking inquiry for 19 months ; •
The governor and deputy governor of the Bank of England , whose mortgage account details were obtained and sold .
Rees , who worked for the Mirror Group as well as the New of the World , is also accused of using a specialist computer hacker in July 2006 to steal information about MI6 agents who had infiltrated the Provisional IRA .
According to a BBC Panorama programme in March , Rees was commissioned by Alex Marunchak , then the News of the World 's executive editor , to hack the information from the computer of Ian Hurst , a former British intelligence officer in Northern Ireland who had stayed in contact with several highly vulnerable agents .
Marunchak has denied the allegations .
The Guardian has previously identified other suspected targets of Rees , including Eric Clapton , Mick Jagger , George Michael , Linford Christie , Gary Lineker , Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan , and the family of the Yorkshire Ripper , Peter Sutcliffe .
None of these cases has been officially confirmed or even investigated .
With many of them , it is not yet clear precisely what form of surveillance
Rees and his agency , Southern Investigations , were using .
Answers may lie in the "" boxloads "" of paperwork the Metropolitan police are believed to have seized from Rees .
But the Labour MP Tom Watson told the prime minister on Wednesday the head of the Operation Weeting inquiry into the News of the World 's investigator , Glenn Mulcaire , had told him that it may be beyond its terms of reference to investigate this evidence . ""
Prime minister , powerful forces are attempting a cover - up , "" Watson said .
"" Please tell me what you intend to do , to make sure this does n't happen . ""
While Glenn Mulcaire worked for the News of the World as a full - time employee from 2001 , Rees worked freelance for the Mirror Group and the News of the World from the mid 1990s .
His agency was earning up to £ 150,000 a year from the News of the World alone .
In 1999 , he was arrested and sentenced to seven years for conspiring to plant cocaine on a woman so that her husband would get custody of their children .
After his release in May 2004 , the News of the World continued to hire him under the editorship of Andy Coulson , who went on to become David Cameron 's media adviser .
Rees 's targets during this period included Prince William 's then girlfriend , Kate Middleton .
On Wednesday , a News International spokesperson said : "" It is well documented that Jonathan Rees and Southern Investigations worked for a whole variety of newspaper groups .
With regards to Tom Watson 's specific allegations , we believe these are wholly inaccurate .
The Met police , with whom we are co - operating fully in Operation Weeting , have not asked us for any information regarding Jonathan Rees .
We note again that Tom Watson MP made these allegations under parliamentary privilege . ""
Scotland Yard is believed to have collected hundreds of thousands of documents during a series of investigations into Rees over his links with corrupt officers , and over the 1987 murder of his former business partner , Daniel Morgan .
Charges of murder against Rees were dismissed earlier this year .
Daniel Morgan 's brother , Alastair , who has been gathering information for a book , told the Guardian he was aware from his own investigations and from material revealed in court hearings that the Metropolitan police was holding "" boxloads "" of evidence on Rees 's activities .
Guardian inquiries suggest that this paperwork could include explosive new evidence of illegal news - gathering by the News of the World and other papers .
According to journalists and investigators who worked with him , Rees exploited his position as a freemason to make links with masonic police officers who illegally sold him information on targets chosen by the News of the World , the Sunday Mirror and the Daily Mirror .
One close contact , Det Sgt Sid Fillery , left the Metropolitan police to become Rees 's business partner and added more officers to their network .
Fillery was subsequently convicted of possession of indecent images of children .
Some police contacts are said to have been blackmailed into providing confidential information .
One of Rees 's former associates claims that Rees had compromising photographs of serving officers , including one who was caught in a drunken coma with a couple of prostitutes and with a toilet seat around his neck .
Rees claimed to be in touch with corrupt Customs officers , a corrupt VAT inspector and two corrupt bank employees .
An investigator who worked for Rees claims he was commissioning burglaries of public figures to steal material for newspapers .
Southern Investigations has previously been implicated in handling paperwork which was stolen by a professional burglar from the safe of Paddy Ashdown 's lawyer , when Ashdown was leader of the Liberal Democrats .
The paperwork , which was eventually obtained by the News of the World , recorded Ashdown discussing his fears that newspapers might expose an affair with his secretary .
The Guardian has confirmed that Rees also used two specialist "" blaggers "" who would telephone the Inland Revenue , the DVLA , banks and phone companies and trick them into handing over private data to be sold to Fleet Street .
One of the blaggers who regularly worked for him , John Gunning , was responsible for obtaining details of bank accounts belonging to Prince Edward and the Countess of Wessex , which were then sold to the Sunday Mirror .
Gunning was later convicted of illegally obtaining confidential data from British Telecom .
Rees also obtained details of accounts at Coutts bank belonging to the Duke and Duchess of Kent .
The bank accounts of Sarah Ferguson , Duchess of York , are also thought to have been compromised .
The Guardian has been told that Rees spoke openly about obtaining confidential data belonging to senior politicians and recorded their names in his paperwork .
One source close to Rees claims that apart from Tony Blair , Straw , Mandelson and Campbell , he also targeted Gaynor Regan , who became the second wife of the foreign secretary , Robin Cook , the former shadow home secretary , Gerald Kaufman ; and the former Tory minister David Mellor .
It is not yet known precisley what Rees was doing with these political targets , although in the case of Peter Mandelson , it appears that Rees obtained confidential details of two bank accounts which he held at Coutts , and his building society account at Britannia .
Rees is also said to have targeted his brother , Miles Mandelson .
Separately , for the News of the World , Glenn Mulcaire was hacking the voicemail of the deputy prime minister , John Prescott , Straw 's successor as home secretary , David Blunkett , the media secretary , Tessa Jowell , and the Europe minister , Chris Bryant .
Scotland Yard has repeatedly refused to reveal how many politicians were victims of phone hacking , although Simon Hughes , Boris Johnson and George Galloway have all been named .
The succesful hacking of a computer belonging to the former British intelligence officer Ian Hurst was achieved in July 2006 by sending Hurst an email containing a Trojan program which copied Hurst 's emails and relayed them to the hacker .
This included messages he had exchanged with at least two agents who informed on the Provisional IRA – Freddie Scappaticci , codenamed Stakeknife ; and a second informant known as Kevin Fulton .
Both men were regarded as high - risk targets for assassination .
Hurst was one of the very few people who knew their whereabouts .
The hacker can not be named for legal reasons .
There would be further security concern if Rees 's paperwork confirmed strong claims by those close to him that he claimed to have targeted the then Metropolitan police commissioner , Sir John Stevens , who would have had regular access to highly sensitive intelligence .
Sir John 's successor , Sir Ian Blair , is believed to have been targeted by Glenn Mulcaire , although it has not been confirmed that Mulcaire succeeded in listening to his voicemail .
Assistant commissioner John Yates was targeted by Rees when Yates was running inquiries into police corruption in the late 1990s .
It appears that Yates did not realise that he himself had been a target when he was responsible for the policing of the phone - hacking affair between July 2009 and January 2011 .
Targeting the Bank of England , Rees is believed to have earned thousands of pounds by penetrating the past or present mortgage accounts of the then governor , Eddie George , his deputy , Mervyn King , who is now governor , and half - a - dozen other members of the monetary policy committee .
According to police information provided to the Guardian in September 2002 , an internal Scotland Yard report recorded that Rees and his network were engaged in long - term penetration of police intelligence and that "" their thirst for knowledge is driven by profit to be accrued from the media "" .
Operation Weeting has been investigating phone hacking by the News of the World since January .
The paper 's assistant editor , Ian Edmondson , chief reporter , Neville Thurlbeck , and former news editor James Weatherup have been arrested and released on police bail .
On Wednesday , A police spokesman said : "" [ We ] can confirm that since January 2011 the MPS [ Metropolitan police service ] has received a number of allegations regarding breach of privacy which fall outside the remit of Operation Weeting .
These allegations are currently being considered . """
2011-06-28,"On Monday Sir Mervyn King , governor of the Bank of England , could be seen in the royal box at Wimbledon .
The weather was sunny and hot , Andy Murray was winning , and the Guv'nor was part of a jolly conversation between another King , Billie Jean , and a king in waiting , Prince William .
As throughout history , these Kings act as if they own the place .
On Tuesday he was on public view again , but in a very different place : a parliamentary room .
And he was watching a very different Andy : Andrew Tyrie is the dry , sometimes sardonic chair of the Treasury select committee , a man who makes an Oxford don look like Ronald McDonald .
In fact , Mr Tyrie speaks to the governor as if he were a moderately astute undergraduate who might have hopes of a 2.1 .
( He speaks to George Osborne as if he were a dense student who got in only because his father contributed lavishly to the restoration fund . )
As always , Sir Mervyn had bad news to share with us all .
He may carry his own personal rain cloud with him .
We needed to make more adjustments so that we did n't have such a balance of payments deficit .
The Irish had done quite well in solving their problems by reducing prices .
But that did n't work in the long term , because your net value decreases ,
so "" what you win on the swings , you lose on the roundabouts "" .
The MPs pressed him on Greece .
Did he have a plan for coping with a Greek default ? ""
Liquidity support may buy time , but the time must be used , "" he replied .
It was no good saying , "" thank goodness , that 's gone away for a few weeks "" . ""
That is a very dangerous cast of mind .
"" You might imagine that because we are not in the euro , and not Greek , we 'll be all right .
Not so .
Yes , French and German banks are exposed because they made huge loans to Greece .
But our banks are exposed to those French and German banks that were exposed to the Greeks .
There is no escape from this contorted misery .
He tried a bit of jargon .
Banks could bid against "" narrow or broad collateral "" .
We needed "" decent window facilities "" .
( This might have had something to do with his call for transparency . )
There were increasing numbers of "" haircuts "" – not a means of personal grooming designed to cheer us up , but "" taking a massive involuntary loss "" .
Or so I am told .
I am sure that in private , Sir Mervyn is a merry , twinkling fellow .
In public , he resembles Eeyore on a bad haircut day .
As for pensions , do n't get him started .
Chancellors announced budgets which paid no heed at all to the massive pension demands that would be arriving soon .
Meanwhile , banks were lending even less to business than before .
And if you thought he was gloomy , you should have heard Paul Tucker , his deputy .
The economy had failed to reach "" escape velocity "" .
The forces buffeting us were "" all over the shop "" –
the shop , I suppose , that closed in your high street yesterday .
I went out , and the first heavy drops of rain were falling from a grim , grey sky ."
2011-06-30,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrived in Ottawa on Thursday at the start of their first official overseas trip together to a Canadian welcome as effusive as if it were their wedding day all over again .
It is almost as if the second largest nation on earth ( by area ) is saying something that their more populous neighbour further south can not match .
After thousands turned out to welcome the couple , Prince William expressed the delight that he and his wife felt at the start of their tour .
In a speech on the steps of Rideau Hall , the official residence of the governor - general of Canada , he said : "" Catherine and I are so delighted to be here in Canada .
Instilled in us by our parents and grandparents , who love this country , we have been looking forward to this moment for a very long time .
We both had a longing to come here together , "" he said .
"" The geography of Canada is unsurpassed , and is famous for being matched only by the hospitality of its people .
We are so very excited about having this opportunity to experience both , and learn much more about this amazing country . ""
The prince , who gave a bilingual address , also joked about his French : "" It will improve as we go on , "" he said .
He concluded by saying : "" Thank you so much .
We are truly looking forward to this adventure . ""
A crowd of several thousand monarchists gathered to cheer the royal couple and were rewarded when they went on a short walkabout after the ceremony .
Friends Alice Hamid , 14 , and Alexandra Anghel , 18 , both from Ottawa , were screaming with joy after meeting the duchess .
Alice said : "" She looked stunning .
This is a moment that will never be erased from my memory - not ever .
"" I told her it was an honour to meet her
and she said , ' Oh , thank you . '
We had been waiting for five hours and were hungry and tired
but once they arrived it did n't matter . ""
Alexandra added : "" She seemed so down to earth .
It was a surreal moment to meet her , someone I never thought I would ever meet
and there she was in front of me .
"" William 's lineage is amazing , he 's literally walking history
– I ca n't believe I saw walking history .
"" A poll this week suggested that 5 % of all Canadians wanted to go and see the royal couple , which means that up to 1.5 million people could turn out to see them : a tribute to their celebrity , perhaps , rather than their constitutional status .
Some of those who made the trip to the war memorial had travelled for hours for a view of the royal couple .
"" It 's our goosebump moment , "" said Holly Davidson , who had driven from Guelph , near Toronto , with her eight - year - old son Jackson .
"" We are so excited to see them .
They are so young , fresh and in love .
It 's inspiring , really . ""
Next to them , David and Sherie Gray had travelled for 15 hours and had been waiting behind the crash barriers since 7 am – about the time the royal couple were leaving Britain – to be present .
"" It 's part of our summer vacation .
We just wanted to see them .
The royal wedding was just wonderful . ""
On arrival , the couple were immediately pulled into the sort of schedule they will have to become used to : a formal welcome at the airport , a wreath - laying ceremony at the National War Memorial , where they were greeted by Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper and his wife Laureen , then on to the governor - general 's residence , followed by a barbecue and the chance to meet what the schedule called "" approximately 120 Canadian youth "" .
The couple will spend eight days in Canada – long for a royal visit these days – followed by three in Los Angeles , where Prince William will play a polo match at Santa Barbara and , the highlight in a celebrity - obsessed town , attend a reception for British actors and film - makers in Hollywood .
On Friday the couple will be in Ottawa for Canada Day –
it is also what would have been the 50th birthday of William 's mother , Diana – during which they will take part in a citizenship ceremony , a procession in the state landau , and a fireworks display .
Later appointments include meetings with the fishermen of Prince Edward Island , the aboriginal Canadians of the Northwest Territories , and cowboys taking part in the annual Calgary Stampede .
The prince will speak publicly three times during the visit – his wife is to remain officially silent –
but it is what they will say during informal meetings and walkabouts that will attract the attention .
Long before their plane had left Heathrow , television stations were making the arrival their lead item newspaper supplements were replete with advice on how to bow , crowds were gathering outside parliament and guards ' bands were marching .
"" Most Canadians do n't think of themselves as living under a monarchy , "" said John Fraser , master of Massey College , Toronto , author of a forthcoming book on the subject .
"" There is no more deference , but there is certainly celebrity status . ""
Although small demonstrations are planned by Quebec separatists when the couple arrive in French - speaking Canada at the weekend , newspaper polls show a majority of locals even there say they are excited by the visit .
The separatists are divided and were heavily beaten in recent elections and have resorted to complaining about the cost of the visit – about $ 1.5 m ( £ 950,000 ) excluding security – rather than the fact that it is happening at all .
A poll by Ipsos - Reid for the Ottawa Sun found , contrarily , that , while 55 % of respondents said they did n't know what all the fuss was about , 55 % also said they were excited by it ; and , while 48 % said formal ties with the monarchy should be ended when the Queen dies , that meant a majority – up 10 % in the last year – disagreed .
More than 1,500 journalists have been accredited – a third more than attended the Queen 's visit here last year – indicating just how quickly the former Ms Middleton 's star has risen ."
2011-07-01,"The Canadian capital city of Ottawa is preparing for an influx of up to 500,000 visitors hoping for a glimpse of the guests of honour â€ “ Prince William , the country 's probable future king , and his bride , the Duchess of Cambridge â€ “ at its Canada Day celebrations on Friday .
If the enthusiasm is as great as it was for the couple 's arrival at the start of their first official overseas tour together on Thursday , it may be overwhelming .
Thousands thronged the streets around the national war memorial and the grounds of Rideau Hall , the governor - general 's residence , many screaming with excitement â€ “ desperate to see the duchess in particular .
The Canada Day events will start with the couple attending a citizenship ceremony for the country 's newest citizens at the Canadian Museum of Civilization .
Such ceremonies are held across Canada each national day , with about 150,000 sworn in .
This year , for the first time , the newly elected Conservative government has called for military service personnel â€ “ preferably veterans of its Afghan participation
â€ “ to attend each ceremony and make speeches about what it means to be a Canadian .
The royal couple will hand out flags to those at the Ottawa ceremony .
The centrepiece of the day will be the formal commemoration of the 144th anniversary of the day Canada recognises as the start of its foundation as a state in 1867 , when the provinces of the eastern seaboard formed a single dominion for the first time .
More poignantly and personally for William , it is the day on which his mother , Princess Diana , would have celebrated her 50th birthday â€ “
she attended the Canada Day celebrations during a royal tour in 1983 , when seven years younger than William is now .
This year , the royal couple will be driven to the formal noon ceremony on Parliament Hill in the state landau before watching military and artistic displays and hearing speeches .
The government says their presence "" will add a youthful dimension "" to the show and William will make his second speech of the tour â€ “ perhaps with a slightly better French accent than he managed on Thursday , when he promised it would improve .
The couple will briefly attend a rock concert featuring Canadian bands , again on the hill , and then a firework display which they will see from the more staid surroundings of a reception at the governor - general 's residence .
What is likely to thrill the crowds more though is if the couple briefly depart from their schedule and stage another walkabout , as they did on Thursday .
Canadians seem to like not only the couple 's youthfulness â€ “ which is being contrasted with the Queen 's longevity and Prince Charles 's stuffiness â€ “ but also their studied informality .
At a barbecue on Thursday evening , the assembled group of young Canadians fell into stunned silence as the couple approached , to be told by the prince : "" Talk among yourselves . """
2011-07-01,"You wait decades for a fairytale royal wedding ...
and then two come along at the same time .
Just months after Britons turned out for the marriage of the Prince William and Catherine Middleton , the tiny principality of Monaco had its own happy ending when its ruler Prince Albert married former Olympic swimmer Charlene Wittstock on Friday .
After days of would - she - wouldn't - she , sparked by reports the bride had a severe case of cold feet , you could have cut the atmosphere in the palace throne room with a bone - handled silver knife .
When the couple walked into the lavish room lined with scarlet silk and damask â€ “ where Albert 's parents Prince Rainier and Hollywood 's Grace Kelly married 55 years ago â€ “ Charlene , wearing a Chanel sky - blue jacket and long dress , gave a weak smile .
It did little to ease the tension .
The groom 's face looked as sombre as his black suit .
Philippe Narmino , conducting the civil ceremony , spoke of the "" joy "" of celebrating the union , but some of those watching on big screens outside spoke of an atmosphere of sadness and an absence of signs of affection .
As South African Charlene , 33 , was asked , in French , if she would marry Albert Grimaldi , Princess Stephanie , the groom 's younger sister , raised her eyes to the elaborately panelled ceiling depicting the history of Alexander the Great , as if invoking his help .
Everyone held their breath .
Charlene said "" oui "" .
Then Albert said "" oui "" .
Outside , the crowds burst into applause .
Inside , Stephanie breathed out , relaxed her shoulders and burst into tears .
Pronounced man and wife , the prince , 55 , who had looked painfully serious throughout the formalities , winked at the new princess of Monaco .
It may have been unkindly labelled the "" other wedding "" , but the nuptials certainly lacked nothing in glitz , not to mention suspense and intrigue .
"" We 've waited a long time for this day , "" one local resident told French journalists .
"" It 's time there was some happiness here . ""
The palace public relations machine was forced into overdrive earlier in the week to deny a report in the French magazine L'Express that Charlene had attempted to flee Monaco , the Mediterranean playground for the rich and famous .
Officials described as "" ugly rumours "" and "" unfounded lies "" claims that Wittstock had fled to nearby Nice airport with a one - way ticket back to South Africa .
L'Express claimed she had discovered her husband - to - be 's private life was "" not as exemplary as she had thought "" .
The palace said the reports were based on jealousy and aimed at spoiling a "" happy event "" .
The couple later appeared arm in arm in Monaco on the eve of the wedding .
Later French press reports suggested she had wanted to call the wedding off amid claims that the prince , who has already admitted having two illegitimate children , had fathered a third child .
The prince and Wittstock have been together for five years .
They met when she took part in swimming championships in Monaco but did not strike up a relationship until several years later .
More than 7,000 citizens were invited to post - ceremony cocktails on the square outside the palace , which was followed by a concert by the French composer Jean Michel Jarre .
A religious ceremony will take place on Saturday with an official dinner and a fireworks display attended by about 40 heads of state including the kings of Spain , Sweden , Lesotho and Belgium , and the presidents of France , Iceland , Ireland , Lebanon , Malta , Germany and Hungary .
Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall are to represent Britain .
Albert and Charlene were guests at the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in April but Britain 's newest royal couple could not attend as they are on an official visit to Canada .
The wedding will be followed on Saturday night by a gala dinner by the multi - Michelin starred French chef Alain Ducasse .
Charlene , who was born in Rhodesia , now Zimbabwe , grew up in South Africa where her father runs a computer business .
She is said to have felt isolated and homesick in Monaco and confessed a few months ago that she had made "" only two friends "" in the principality .
The hotly denied rumours of her flight prompted French newspapers to revive the fabled curse of the Grimaldis , said to date back to 1297 when the first Grimaldi , Francesco the Spiteful , tricked the principality 's defenders by disguising himself as a monk seeking sanctuary who then slaughtered them all .
In 1982 , Princess Grace was killed in a car crash .
Her eldest daughter , Princess Caroline , also lost a husband in a motorboat accident ."
2011-07-01,"Prince William saw the swearing in of 25 new Canadian citizens on Friday , though he – prince of Canada that he is – was not one of them .
There were Chinese , Cubans , French , Greeks , Haitians , Romanians and even Madagascan residents swearing an oath of allegiance to his grandmother and to him as one of her heirs and successors , yet if anyone noticed the irony , they did not care to mention it .
The prince , with his wife , Duchess Kate , beside him , was guest of honour on Canada Day in Ottawa and tens of thousands turned out to cheer and whoop .
From early morning a sea of red and white converged in front of the country 's parliament .
On what was to become a hot and nearly cloudless day Canadians trudged towards the site , most wearing the national colours , many carrying maple leaf flags in their hair or on their baseball caps or T - shirts .
If Canadians are God 's doughty people – and some of them these days his doughy people too – they were stoically out to enjoy themselves .
Some even carried macs , just in case .
Across the river , outside the Canadian Museum of Civilization , an appropriate place for the citizenship ceremony in this most civilised nation , there was the first demonstrator of the tour .
Dressed in a bear costume and bearing a motto "" Bearskins look better on bears "" , she did n't seem to mind being ignored .
Inside the museum 's hall , lined with giant totem poles , mounties genially posed for photographs with the new citizens while the Canadian air force 's string quartet gently strummed the theme from Desert Island Discs like a palm court orchestra – a strange choice as desert islands are one thing Canada lacks .
On television screens more characteristic scenes were shown , most of them seemingly including snow .
Two of the new citizens , Romanians Adrian and Florentina Uzea , cradling their baby daughter , Stephanie , were explaining their choice .
Both agricultural economists – Adrian now works for the national organisation of broiler chicken farmers –
they had decided Canada was a safer place to raise their daughter , though they retain their old nationality as well just in case there is a roasting in the Canadian poultry sector . ""
In Romania when you decide to have kids you have to think twice , but here you know you can support your family , "" said Florentina .
Looking round , she added : "" This is better than I expected … and yes , it is a thrill .
We did n't know the prince would be here until recently . ""
"" It 's appropriate , "" chipped in her husband .
"" Canada was a dominion of Britain , which makes it more special . ""
Ceremonies were taking place across the country , from Gander to Whitehorse , the governor general said , swearing in maybe 150,000 new citizens , but only Ottawa had a prince to watch .
And soon he was among them , grinning his diffident chipmunk smile , with his wife , a striking vision in white and red , beside him .
Her costume , by the Montreal - born designer Erdem Moralioglu , was apparently the one chosen for her engagement photographs by Mario Testino last year – waste not want not , though hardly an austerity drive .
It was topped by a small scarlet cross between a hat and a fascinator crowned with maple leaves and tailed by equally scarlet stilettos .
Dutifully , the couple waited while the governor general , David Johnston , read out the oath of citizenship – first in French – leading the new citizens as they murmured allegiance to
Sa Majesté la Reine Elizabeth Deux ; and then in English , louder , just to make sure .
"" We are grateful you have chosen Canada , "" he said as if they had taken out a life insurance policy , which in a way some probably had .
It was a gentle invitation , he said , echoing words of the Queen .
Then : "" Do your best for Canada . ""
For the royal party it was then on to the more boisterous celebrations across the river and up the hill , a journey partly undertaken in the state landau .
Meanwhile , the crowds at the museum agreed the couple were lovely , sweet , gorgeous , a credit to Canada , a country Kate had not visited before .
Three characters standing well back from the crowd , bearing posters saying "" No oath to royalty "" , "" Democracy not royalty "" and , slightly more cumbersomely , "" Monarchy oaths violate charter freedoms "" were politely ignored –
it is the Canadian way ."
2011-07-02,"Radical French - Canadian separatists are promising to stage a demonstration in Quebec City on Sunday as Prince William becomes the first member of the royal family to visit it in nearly 50 years .
Two years ago , demonstrators hurled eggs and scuffled with police when Prince Charles and Camilla , Duchess of Cornwall visited Montreal .
The Queen has not been to Quebec City since 1964 , when hundreds of demonstrators turned their backs on her , and she has only rarely visited Montreal â€ “ both places on William and Kate 's itinerary , albeit briefly , this weekend .
A protest will pose a severe challenge to the prince and his bride , the Duchess of Cambridge , on their first official overseas tour together , a trip marked so far by large , adulatory crowds in Ottawa and universally benign media coverage .
Most of the tour is in anglophone Canada â€ “
the couple go to Prince Edward Island , Anne of Green Gables country , on Sunday night ; then on to Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories , and Calgary in Alberta for the annual stampede and rodeo ; before heading across the border to Los Angeles at the end of their trip next weekend .
The Quebec Resistance Network has called on supporters to protest against the "" yoke "" of the British monarchy "" for democracy , dignity and independence "" .
But , perhaps sensing the national mood , its complaints have been directed against the cost ( an estimated Â£1 m , excluding security ) as much as the principle .
Opinion polls have shown that a majority in French Canada are excited by the royal couple 's arrival .
Patrick Bourgeois , a QRN spokesman , said : "" If they want to come to Quebec for a honeymoon and pay for it themselves , that is not a problem , but if they are coming to humiliate us , we 'll be there .
The visit is nothing other than a political operation by the federal government to show the world that Quebec accepts its place within Canada . ""
In May , the federal Conservative government of Stephen Harper â€ “ regarded as the most pro - monarchist prime minister in Canada since the 1950s â€ “ was elected and in Quebec the Bloc QuÃ © bÃ
© cois lost all but four of its 47 seats , leaving the separatist movement split .
Separatism , along with republicanism , is seen as a distraction by many Canadians , and senior figures in both movements have called for any demonstrations to be civilised and responsible .
It is a far cry from the heady days of RenÃ © LÃ © vesque , founder of the separatist Parti QuÃ
© bÃ
© cois , and General de Gaulle 's "" Vive le QuÃ © bec libre "" in 1967 .
The spikiness is still evident , however .
In an online debate in the francophone La Presse there were plenty of complaints about the monarchy .
Guillaume Lavoie , executive director of an organisation called Mission Leadership , said : "" It is not the demonstration of the radical independents that is problematic , it is the peaceful tolerance of all the other Canadians opposed to the monarchy .
By their silence they are accomplices in the marginalisation of their point of view and of the cause of republicanism .
"" The republican movement has kept a low profile and has decided against demonstrations .
"" We do n't want all the loonies coming out , "" said Tom Freda of Citizens for a Canadian Republic .
"" Right now there does not seem to be much urgency , because the Queen is healthy . ""
Even if the formidable constitutional hurdles to ending the monarchy could be overcome â€ “ a change requiring the unlikely unanimous consent of all the country 's provinces and territories â€ “ public opinion
seems to be moving in the opposite direction , something this week 's visit by the photogenic young royals can only encourage .
Dr John Fraser , master of Massey College , Toronto , said : "" Most Canadians do n't think of themselves as living under a monarchy , but neither do they think of themselves as living in a republic .
Both sound equally strange .
On the other hand , they have no problem with the concept of the crown . ""
The royal couple have twinkled and beamed and been suitably unstuffy in meeting the starstruck crowds .
William even injected some English - sounding French into his speeches in Ottawa , assuring the crowd diffidently that his accent would get better .
Whether the symbolism of sending the royal couple overnight down the St Laurence river from Montreal to Quebec in a Canadian frigate , or placing one of the engagements in an old British fort , is diplomatic remains to be seen .
But they visited a children 's hospital in Montreal on Saturday and will spend time at the Maison Dauphine , a centre for street kids and runaways in Quebec â€ “ neither visit provocative .
Even the Quebec Resistance Network appears to believe violence will not help the cause , incurring some ridicule by hiring 40 bouncers to deter hooliganism when it demonstrates outside Quebec city hall as Prince William meets the francophone Royal 22nd Regiment .
"" We chose them based on their build , "" Bourgeois told the Canadian Press .
"" If some moron shows up and provokes police and is imperilling our plan and the safety of our supporters , we 're definitely going to ensure that person 's booted out . """
2011-07-03,"Prince William and the royal party could have been forgiven for not noticing , but there was a part of Quebec that had no intention of welcoming him and his wife , except with whistles , saucepan lids , vuvuzelas and , incongruously , bagpipes .
The prince – a rare British royal venturing into the heart of francophone , would - be separatist Quebec – received a formal welcome and inspection parade outside the city hall by the bearskin - helmeted members of the locally recruited 22nd regiment , known as "" Les Van Doos "" .
The mayor 's words of welcome were warm , and even the regimental goat , Baptiste , looked benignly upon him .
So far , all in a day 's work .
But a few streets away , around 300 demonstrators had a different message .
Mostly young , T - shirt clad and some facially studded , but with a scattering of older folk , they had gathered outside an Irish pub to bellow , toot and whistle the message that the monarchy should get out of Canada .
Blue and white fleur - de - lys Quebec flags were waved , as was the green , white and red standard of the failed insurrection of 1837 .
Their handmade banners told the story : "" Parasite go home "" said one , "" And do n't come back "" added another . ""
Pay for your trip "" said a third . ""
William dégage "" was the message .
Even more bluntly and in English : "" Kate go UK yourself "" .
And one for students of Britain 's victory over France in the seven years war : "" We are still waiting for your excuses for 1755 . ""
[ See footnote . ]
Their cries scarcely wafted up the hill to the prince in city hall – a double line of gendarmes prevented the demonstrators from getting any closer – but they lacked nothing in passion .
The arrival of a busload of reinforcements from Montreal was greeted with passionate fraternal cheers .
It may be rather doubtful , however , if those storming the Bastille in 1789 handed out leaflets urging : "" No violence will be tolerated in the ranks , nor towards the admirers of royalty , nor the police or other demonstrators … gardez votre calme . ""
"" We have no bad feelings about the British empire , "" explained Julien Gaudreau , 23-year - old spokesman for the Quebec Resistance Movement .
"" We want to change the constitution here , not because of what happened in the past , but what will happen in the future .
We have hired a plane to fly overhead with a banner for free Quebec , but we do n't know whether it is going to be able to take off with the weather around .
"" We think the monarchy should be abolished in Quebec .
It may not be a good time for independence , but we are all right with that .
We are young and we are going to be about for a long time .
Independence is not going to go away . ""
Polls indicate that a majority of francophone residents support the idea of independence , but do n't see its practicality , and the separatist Bloc Québécois was thrashed in May 's federal election , losing all but four of its 47 seats .
Up the hill , the prince was trying out his schoolboy French – "" C'est un honneur pour
nous d'être parmi vous
…
merci votre patience avec mon accent ""
– and was cheered for doing so .
Overhead , the plane and its banner finally made an appearance – a $ 1,000 gesture it looked as though the demonstrators could ill afford .
There was also a demonstration at the couple 's earlier engagement in Montreal on Saturday evening when a group of young protesters with placards gathered outside the Sainte - Justine university hospital next to a larger crowd of wellwishers .
This was a minor quirk in a day of engagements : a tree - planting and meeting with war veterans in Ottawa , the hospital tour to visit sick children and premature babies , and to conclude a cookery lesson at a training college for chefs in Montreal .
The latter is the sort of thing the royals have to endure on tours : a strangely artificial demonstration of ordinariness at which they are either supposed to show surprising aptitude or – all the better for the media – hopeless ineptitude .
There , the prince was shown how to prepare a lobster souffle and Kate was given instruction in the not - too - difficult creation of an amuse - bouche of foie gras on a toasted brioche .
Theresa Rindress , the student asked to show the duchess how to do it , confided afterwards : "" She was fantastic .
She was very competent with the knife .
I asked her if she liked to cook at home
and she said she likes to cook but does not do fancy things .
She more makes big batches , throws a few ingredients together , trying new things .
That 's how chefs experiment . ""
Last night the royals were heading back to anglophone Canada – to Prince Edward Island , land of one of the duchess 's favourite books , Anne of Green Gables – and the prince 's spokesman could afford to be condescending towards the demonstrators : "" The couple are taking it in their stride .
They are getting a very warm welcome .
They consider [ the demonstrations ] as all part of the rich fabric of Canada . ""

2011-07-06,"Many young couples seeking to get away from it all might choose a tent on a campsite – but not Prince William and his bride .
Instead they got a small island to themselves in the heart of the Canadian wilderness , leaving their retinue and protection officers behind and having just a chef , nesting bald eagles and the Canadian national bird , the loon , for company .
The trip on Tuesday evening following a day of official engagements in Yellowknife , capital of the Northwest Territories , was to an uninhabited island on Blachford Lake about 100 miles away from the city .
The granite rock landmass , which has only a few pine trees and a sandy beach , is normally known as Eagle island .
But owners Mike Freeland and Tessa Macintosh , who also own a nearby tourist lodge , happily played along with suggestions that in future it would be known as Honeymoon island .
They confided that they themselves had spent the first night of their marriage there in 1991 .
After watching the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge set off in their canoe , Macintosh said : "" When I was taken there I thought my new husband was the most romantic man on Earth .
I 'm sure that is just how Kate must feel now .
"" I think it is tremendous that they have decided to come here and spend time .
They may not have long but after all the travelling and chaos of the past few days , this really will recharge their batteries .
"" Her husband , who has owned the land since 1980 , added : "" The island is very beautiful .
I 'm not sure if Kate knew about this in advance or whether it was a surprise .
"" There is n't much on the island .
But one of our chefs has prepared a meal of local cranberries , Bannock bread and caribou as well as some white fish . ""
The midnight sunset here is regarded as the slowest sunset in the world and it 's very spectacular . ""
After three hours , the couple were collected from the island by a motorboat and flown by seaplane back to Yellowknife .
Their next move is to a less happy spot – Slave Lake , south of Yellowknife , where they are meeting the survivors of disastrous recent forest fires and the rescue services who responded to emergency calls ."
2011-07-06,"Prince William and his bride , the Duchess of Cambridge , received more than a perfunctory wedding gift as they reached the most northerly point of their Canadian tour on Tuesday , when they were presented with a brooch and cufflinks made from locally mined diamonds , at the North West Territories capital Yellowknife .
The jewellery , made in the shape of polar bears , contained 692 stones : 302 in the brooch and 390 in the cufflinks , made by one of the world 's leading specialists in the field , the Harry Winston company , and was exceptional even for a couple who lack little .
They were told that the diamonds symbolised the permanence of relations between the territories ' first nation , northern people and the British monarchy .
The company would not say how much the gifts were worth , only that it took 250 man hours to cut the diamonds to shape .
More than 3,000 people turned out to greet the royal couple , who were treated to dancing , drumming and singing from local tribespeople and a display of street hockey , played with ice hockey sticks but on tarmac - the prince essayed a few shots at goal without taking his jacket off .
As has become customary this week , the prince tried a few words in the native language - dene , this time , not French : "" Maihsi - cho , kay - ya - muck - puck , "" which roughly translated means thank you very much .
Yellowknife is not accustomed to much publicity , or celebrity visitors : founded as a gold mining town in the 1930s it is a long way from anywhere and Edmonton is regarded as the nearest metropolitan tourist centre .
The gold mines have gone but the diamonds remain and the city has one of the highest per capita incomes in the country in order to entice workers to a place that has snow for eight months of the year and temperatures drop to -30C in winter .
Yesterday , by contrast , was warm and sunny .
In the crowd were Andrea Booth , a local nurse and her father Jack Booth , up from Toronto on vacation with his partner Sharon Gilbert - they had decided to drive all the way and taken seven days to cover the 3,000 miles .
Andrea said : "" We have celebrities who come up here to hunt
but they are usually incognito ,
so it 's really fun to have a public event like this visit .
It makes us feel part of the world . ""
Unlike in francophone Canada at the weekend , the crowd was warmly welcoming , with screams and whoops drowning out the obligatory - in this part of the world - Scottish pipe band dressed in kilts , sporrans and glengarries .
Union flags were waved and one young woman - obviously more in hope than expectation - held up a home - made banner saying : "" I am calm - I can still marry Harry . ""
On Wednesday the couple move on to meet victims of a recent wildfire in the Slave Lake area and rescue and emergency services there , but for most of the coming two days they are spending private time out of the public and media spotlight before re - emerging to attend the annual Calgary rodeo and stampede on Friday and heading south to Los Angeles to mingle in the celebrity culture of Hollywood over the weekend ."
2011-07-07,"New world celebrity will meet old world monarchy on Friday as Prince William and his bride land in California to kick off a three - day visit to America that has made the royal pair the hottest couple in Hollywood .
Travelling from the Calgary rodeo and stampede in Canada , the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will begin their trip to southern California with an exclusive party at the house of Britain 's consul general , Dame Barbara Hay .
The plush mansion is in the Hancock Park district , just a few miles from the A - list havens of West Hollywood and Beverly Hills .
Then , after a charity polo match in Santa Barbara , the pair will attend a black - tie event on their second night at downtown Los Angeles ' Belasco Theatre , which is a showcase for emerging British acting talent .
Forty - two young British stars lined up by Bafta will be at the dinner and Hollywood studios including Disney and Universal have forked out $ 25,000 for each table .
British actors at the bash include Cemetery Junction star Tom Hughes , Talulah Riley and Gugu Mbatha - Raw , who is currently appearing on American cinema screens with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts in Larry Crowne .
The event is pitched as an opportunity for junior British talent to meet influential Hollywood studio heads , top agents and major stars .
At least two British actors will be seated at each table to mingle with the great and good of Tinseltown .
It is up for debate whether the studios have paid out thousands of dollars for that privilege or simply the hope of a quick chat with the royal couple .
Seasoned Hollywood - watchers certainly think the duke and duchess are likely the real reason the expensive tickets have sold out and the invitations have become the most sought after in town .
"" It 's like they dug up Elvis .
Movie people are killing themselves for these tickets , "" said Gayl Murphy , a Los Angeles - based author and celebrity interviewer .
Who has made it on to the list of attendees has not yet been revealed , despite the best efforts of Hollywood 's legion of gossip scribes .
Indeed the royal couple seem to be turning the tables on the usual celebrity experience in Los Angeles .
The local paparazzi , famed for its aggression in pursuing errant A - listers , have been warned off bothering the duke and duchess and threatened with arrest if they take photographs in certain areas .
The local police have forced residents near Dame Barbara 's residence to sign no - trespass letters and so - called "" keep away "" orders will allow officers to arrest photographers taking pictures from private property .
The American visit comes at a time when the royal couple are still basking in the afterglow of coverage of their wedding in the US .
America 's TV networks and celebrity magazines devoted endless hours and pages to the nuptials .
The duchess has been praised in the US media for her fashion style and the pair are seen as a comfortably modern face for an ancient institution .
Indeed when the Newsweek editor , Tina Brown , recently put a fake image of an aged Princess Diana on the cover of the magazine under the headline "" Diana at 50 "" she was roundly condemned by other US media outlets for lacking sensitivity .
The duke and duchess themselves are showing a far cannier appreciation of image management .
Aside from polo and parties , their schedule also pays a nod to the vast numbers of Los Angelenos who do not lead the lives of movie stars .
They will also visit Inner City Arts , an academy that gives children from poor backgrounds free classes in the arts .
The project stands on the notorious Skid Row , which is the unofficial homeless capital of America .
No doubt the visit will be good PR for a royal couple seemingly mindful of the economic hard times still gripping America and Britain .
But observers also wondered if their three - day visit to the city would really matter that much to most ordinary citizens , especially those living in the tougher neighbourhoods .
"" People are excited .
It is good for the city .
But if you live in south - central it probably does not matter that much to you , "" Murphy said ."
2011-07-11,"Following their successful 12-day visit to Canada and the US , the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge plan to go "" under the radar "" to concentrate on Prince William 's career with the RAF , a St James 's Palace spokesman said as the couple flew home from Los Angeles .
They will take a break from royal duties for the rest of the summer and do no more than one or two engagements a month in the autumn and winter .
It was said that they wanted to avoid taking attention away from the Queen and Prince of Wales in the runup to the Queen 's diamond jubilee next summer .
But other reasons were also given .
William , 29 , hopes to be promoted by earning his captaincy in the RAF search and rescue force early next year and has to complete extra hours flying and studying to progress from being a co - pilot to taking charge of his own Sea King helicopter .
The couple want to settle into their marriage after a busy period since their wedding in April , during which they have fulfilled official engagements at home and undertaken a strenuous overseas tour .
They are based in Anglesey , where the duke is undertaking air sea rescue duties .
It was said the couple hoped to emulate the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh who , early in their married life , were based for a short period in Malta because of Prince Philip 's naval career .
The spokesman said the duchess had a busy schedule of meetings with charity representatives to allow her to understand the work of her husband 's patronages and to decide which causes she wishes to support .
The announcement is likely to increase speculation that the couple are hoping for a child soon .
The duchess confided to a spectator during their Canadian tour that she wants to have children â€ “ an admission that would only have been controversial if she had said the opposite , but which will whet tabloid appetites for an early announcement .
But their spokesman said : "" They are very conscious to make sure that the runup to 2012 is the Queen 's year .
She quite rightly should be in the spotlight .
"" The Queen and the Prince of Wales are fully aware of their plan to go under the radar in the next few months and are very supportive of it .
"" The couple will be expected to be involved in official duties supporting the London Olympics and William is due to be posted to the Falkland Islands without his wife for two months next year , as it is classed as an unaccompanied deployment .
Despite a busy summer , the duke has managed to complete his RAF duties , flying at least the minimum number of required hours â€ “ eight 24-hour shifts in the air and eight 24-hour shifts on call .
The spokesman said : "" To get his captaincy you have to do over and above that and have extra training .
He is going for his flying captaincy in early 2012 and will move from the right to the left seat .
He needs to keep up his flying hours and there are some exams to get through .
A lot of work needs to be done and he has to dedicate himself to that .
"" The second reason is more personal really .
Despite what some people think , they have n't had a home together before .
Since they got married they were on honeymoon , in London for most of June for family events and other events and want to go back and have a married life together under the radar and enjoy their life in Anglesey and keeping things chilled .
"" The third reason is the duchess : she has got a lot of things in the pipeline in terms of meeting representatives of charities and lots of the duke 's charities so she can begin to know his work better and get to know what she wants to take on .
She is already interested in particular in things like sports therapy and arts therapy .
She has got to determine what her interests are and whether she can actually make a difference . ""
The spokesman said the couple were delighted with the reception they had received in Canada and California . ""
They think it 's gone really well , "" he said .
"" They have just been on such a buzz every day , coming back full of stories .
They have really enjoyed it . ""

2011-07-26,""" Special factors "" that limited Britain 's economic growth in the second quarter of 2011 to 0.2 % , as cited by the Office for National Statistics : Japanese earthquake Three of Japan 's largest carmakers reduced output in the UK after the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March .
Honda , Nissan and Toyota cut staff hours , banned overtime or suspended work altogether in April , after running short of components as Japan battled with its humanitarian and environmental disaster .
Royal wedding Prince William and Kate Middleton 's big day had a mixed impact on the UK economy .
Tourism was boosted , as were sales of Union flags and mugs .
But this effect appears to have been wiped out by the extra bank holiday , which encouraged many factory owners to suspend plant operations .
Olympic spending Around Â£300 m was spent on Olympic tickets in May , the equivalent of 0.1 % of GDP .
The ONS has ruled that this spending will not be counted until the third quarter of 2012 , when the Games takes place .
This makes consumer spending look artificially low .
Unseasonal heat
The cost of heating Britain 's homes and offices fell during April 's unusually warm weather .
This cut spending on electricity and gas supply output by 3.2 % â€ “ good for carbon emissions but not for GDP . ...
And one excuse the ONS cited for the economy shrinking unexpectedly by 0.5 % in the final quarter of 2010 : Too much snow The heavy and widespread snow that struck Britain last winter
â€ “ some of the deepest experienced in the United Kingdom for decades
â€ “ caused flights to be grounded and fuel rationed , and left many supermarket shelves unstocked .
Without these extreme weather conditions , the ONS said , the economy would probably have been flat ."
2011-09-05,"The Duchess of Cambridge effect was in evidence again at one of the most prestigious prizes in fashion with two of her favourite designers , including the woman behind the dress she wore for her marriage to Prince William , competing for the top award .
Sarah Burton , who has become one of the world 's best - known fashion designers
thanks to that dress , has been nominated as designer of the year at the British Fashion Awards along with Erdem Moralioglu , whose navy lace dress was worn by the duchess on her first foreign tour of Canada .
The nomination caps a remarkable year for Burton who was named creative director of the Alexander McQueen label in May last year , following its founder 's suicide three months before .
She has garnered critical acclaim for the collections she has created since his death , which fashion critics have praised for rebooting the brand in a more feminine , delicate direction .
Her wedding dresses for the duchess and her maid of honour , Pippa Middleton , were almost universally deemed a triumph .
Moralioglu – who goes by his first name Erdem – counts Samantha Cameron , the prime minister 's wife , among his fans , as well as her predecessor in No 10 , Sarah Brown .
Michelle Obama has been another customer , and the Canadian - born designer has also dressed Thandie Newton , Keira Knightley , and Sienna Miller .
This is the second year in a row that he has been nominated as designer of the year .
Also competing for the top award is Christopher Kane , a favourite of American Vogue 's editor - in - chief Anna Wintour , who but for the royal wedding might have been the favourite .
The Scottish designer 's clothes , famous for their offbeat references , were worn by Samantha Cameron to Downing Street 's London fashion week drinks reception earlier this year .
Other high profile nominations in the awards , which will be announced in late November , include Stella McCartney and Victoria Beckham – both up for the Designer Brand of the Year category along with Burberry and the now London - based Tom Ford .

2011-09-23,"A protester who was held in police cells for six hours during a crackdown on street protests during the royal wedding has received Â£5,000 compensation and an official apology from the Metropolitan police .
Republican , Adam Moniz , 30 , was arrested by 10 officers and kept locked up in custody for the duration of the wedding while attempting to make his way to a council - approved demonstration nearly a mile away from Buckingham Palace that morning .
His detention was part of dozens of other "" pre - crime "" arrests that took place around the wedding of Kate Middleton and Prince William on 29 April .
The arrests were later condemned by activists and lawyers as "" Orwellian "" and potentially illegal .
Moniz , who was travelling alone by train from his home in Southampton had been planning to join other republicans in Red Lion square , Holborn , at an event registered by Camden council called Not the Royal Wedding .
Moniz was first stopped by British Transport police ( BTP ) when they boarded his train at Clapham Junction and discovered his banner which read "" democracy not monarchy "" .
Moniz said he told them he was planning to attend the Red Lion square event and even offered to turn back but that the BTP officers told him he should continue with his journey .
However , when he alighted at Victoria station , Moniz was searched and arrested on suspicion of an "" anticipated "" breach of the peace .
In a letter from the directorate of professional standards , the branch of the Met that deals with conduct and behaviour , police apologised to Moniz for "" distress "" suffered as a result of his arrest .
Signed by acting detective superintendant Mark Eley , the letter admits that policing of "" large scale public order events is a challenging task "" , and that the balance of "" rights and freedoms "" between different parties had "" not been achieved "" in Moniz 's case .
Speaking about the Met 's apology Moniz said : "" I was treated like a criminal just so that someone else could be treated like a prince .
I was denied freedom of movement through central London and freedom of expression purely because of my republican beliefs . ""
He added that the events underlined the importance of the phrase on his banner , "" Democracy not Monarchy "" .
Moniz 's lawyer Sarah McSherry , from the firm Christian Khan said : "" Mr Moniz 's arrest and detention constituted a breach of his fundamental and democratic right to protest â€ ¦
The [ Metropolitan police ] commissioner , when challenged , has compensated our client , destroyed all photographs taken of him , apologised for the arrest and confirmed that any record of it will reflect that Mr Moniz was paid damages and an apology made . """
2011-09-25,"Many fathers may have doubts about handing the car keys to their sons , perhaps with good reason .
When Prince William borrowed his father 's beloved old Aston Martin to drive his new wife away from Buckingham Palace on their wedding day , the excitement apparently made him forget a basic rule of motoring .
Release the handbrake .
The slip - up on the couple ' big day was revealed by the Sun 's royal photographer Arthur Edwards on the BBC 's Desert Island Discs programme on Sunday .
Edwards , recounting the background to the bride and groom 's brief pootle down the Mall to Clarence House , said : "" I was talking to Prince Charles about that .
I said : ' Did you mind him borrowing your car ? '
Because he loves that car .
It was a birthday present from his mother on his 21st birthday . ""
He said : ' Oh , no .
He asked me if he could use it . '
"" But when Edwards pointed out there seemed to be a problem with the 41-year - old sports car , Prince Charles apparently answered : "" Yes .
Because he did n't take the handbrake off .
"" Edwards also revealed that William had made sure he got a shot of the couple 's kiss on the Buckingham Palace balcony despite his original press pass giving him a spot outside Westminster Abbey .
He said he had wanted a position outside the palace with a view of the balcony "" because great things have happened "" there .
But William had ensured he got a prime spot at the palace – because the couple wanted copies of his photos for themselves . ""
That was a pleasure to do that , "" he said ."
2011-11-09,"The News of the World 's covert surveillance of Prince William was allegedly commissioned while the paper was under police scrutiny for hacking into voicemail messages of members of the royal household .
Derek Webb , the private investigator who told Tuesday 's Newsnight that he was paid by the News of the World to follow more than 100 targets over eight years until the paper was closed in July , said he was asked to follow Prince William in 2006 in Gloucestershire .
During the same year a Metropolitan police investigation into the hacking of the voicemails of members of the royal household led to the arrest of News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire , a private investigator employed by the paper .
The police were called in after two diary items were published about Prince William in the News of the World 's Blackadder column , which the royal household suspected could only have come from hacked voicemail messages .
Goodman and Mulcaire pleaded guilty to intercepting voicemail messages and were jailed in January 2007 .
A spokesman for Prince William said : "" Our position has been as it always has been , since 2006 , and that is not to comment . ""
Among the 100 or more people Webb told Newsnight he targeted on the News of the World 's orders were the former Labour home secretary Charles Clarke , John Prescott , Prince Harry 's ex - girlfriend Chelsy Davy , London mayor Boris Johnson , and model Elle MacPherson .
Maxine Carr , the ex - girlfriend of murderer Ian Huntley , the Duke of Westminster , Sir Alex Ferguson and Sienna Miller were also on Webb 's list .
Webb said the paper also paid him to conduct covert surveillance on Angelina Jolie , Simon Cowell , Sir Paul McCartney , David Miliband and Heather Mills .
Others he said he had followed for the paper included Gary Lineker , former attorney general Lord Goldsmith and Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe 's parents .
It was also reported on Tuesday that Webb tailed Tom Watson , the MP who helped expose the phone - hacking scandal in parliament , for five days during the Labour party conference in 2009 .
Watson sits on the select committee that will grill News International chief James Murdoch for a second time on Thursday .
Webb , a former police officer who worked for many years in covert surveillance and received additional training from MI5 , said there was nothing illegal in what he was doing and the paper was pleased with his work and kept commissioning him .
However , he said he felt NoW should have given him "" loyalty money "" for his eight years of service when it closed , but it refused .
News International declined to comment on Webb 's claims .
However , the News of the World 's former features editor , Jules Stenson , appeared on Newsnight to defend the paper .
Stenson told Newsnight that Webb had been commissioned by the newsdesk , but the features desk had also used private detectives to pursue "" the great and the good "" for important scoops such as the revelation that Prince Harry had smoked cannabis .
He said it was common among the media to use private investigators and there was nothing wrong with it . ""
All media employ private eyes , that includes the BBC , "" he added .
"" Investigative journalism is messy .
The first goal of investigative journalists is to find the people .
The crooks and villains are n't on the electoral roll , they 're not on Acacia Avenue , "" said Stenson .
He told Newsnight that Webb 's story was "" one - sided "" and "" very slanted "" and was the view of a man who had "" a grievance "" against the paper because he had been cut loose when it closed in July and he had not received compensation for loss of work .
Stenson 's appearance on Newsnight was almost as significant as Webb 's , as few top journalists have come out to defend the paper .
He said he was "" extremely surprised "" by revelations in the Guardian this week that his former paper hired Webb to run covert surveillance on two of the lawyers representing phone - hacking victims as part of an operation to put pressure on them to stop their work .
Webb secretly videoed Mark Lewis and Charlotte Harris as well as family members and associates .

2011-11-09,"A private detective has claimed that the News of the World paid him to target more than 90 people , including Prince William , former attorney general Lord Goldsmith and Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe 's parents , over eight years until this July .
Derek Webb , a former police officer , said he started work for the paper shortly after setting up his private detective agency in 2003 .
He told the BBC 's Newsnight he continued to do surveillance until it was closed over the phone - hacking scandal .
The investigator said he was paid by the paper to follow more than 90 targets including Prince William , Goldsmith , Radcliffe 's parents and Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker .
"" I was working for them extensively on many jobs throughout that time .
I never knew when I was going to be required .

â€
¦ it could be anywhere in the country , "" Webb told Newsnight 's Richard Watson , in a report broadcast on the BBC2 daily current affairs show on Tuesday night .
In 2006 he was asked to follow Prince William while he spent a few days in Gloucestershire .
Webb did many years on covert surveillance and had MI5 training .
He told the BBC he set up his own detective agency in 2003 and was approached shortly after that by the News of the World .
Most commissions were by phone , but sometimes he was sent photos or addresses ; orders came from several NoW journalists , he reveals .
The Guardian revealed yesterday that the News International title had also paid Webb to run covert surveillance on two lawyers representing phone - hacking victims in an operation to pressure them to stop their work .
Webb secretly videoed Mark Lewis and Charlotte Harris as well as family members and associates .
Evidence suggests an attempt to gather evidence for false smears about their private lives .
Others named in the programme are former Chelsea manager JosÃ © Mourinho and Prince Harry 's ex - girlfriend Chelsy Davy .
His targets rarely suspected : "" 95 % of the job , I was never rumbled , even following them for weeks on end . ""
He said what he did was not illegal and he had decided to speak out after the News of the World failed to compensate him in July .
Its former features editor Jules Stenson told Newsnight Webb 's story was "" one - sided "" , "" very slanted "" and the view of a man with "" a grievance "" due to an issue of payment .

Fifa stood by its refusal to grant an FA request that poppies be worn on England 's shirt but agreed a compromise that ensures the remembrance symbol will be visible on the players ' kit .
The move , which is understood to have been made after discussions involving Alex Horne , the FA 's general secretary , and his Fifa counterpart , JÃ © rÃ´me Valcke , was welcomed by Cameron and Prince William as well as the FA . ""
The FA can confirm that Fifa has today agreed that the England team will now be permitted to wear a poppy on the black armbands the players will wear during Saturday 's match with Spain , "" a statement said .
"" While continuing to adhere to the laws of the game , wearing the poppy on the armband does ensure the poppy will be visible throughout the game .
The FA welcomes Fifa 's decision and thanks them for agreeing to this . ""
Fifa 's decision came at the end of a day on which the dispute had escalated .
Cameron said he would support the England team if they defied Fifa by wearing poppies on their shirts ; Prince William described the poppy as "" a universal symbol of remembrance "" ; and two members of the far - right English Defence League occupied the roof of the world governing body 's headquarters in Zurich to protest .
St James 's Palace said of Prince William , the Duke of Cambridge : "" The Duke 's strong view is the poppy is a universal symbol of remembrance , which has no political , religious or commercial connotations .
"" In his letter Prince William demanded that Fifa make "" an exception in this special circumstance "" .
After the compromise he was said by a spokesman to be "" happy with this resolution "" .
A Downing Street spokesman also welcomed Fifa 's move , saying : "" It 's a sensible way forward . ""
Cameron had written to Sepp Blatter asking Fifa 's president to "" find a sensible solution "" and , in the House of Commons , had branded the ban on England players wearing poppies against Spain as "" outrageous "" and urged the FA to take a "" very strong line "" .
Speaking during prime minister 's questions , Cameron said : "" This is not an issue of left or right or Labour or Conservative .
We all wear the poppy with pride , even if we do n't approve of the wars people were fighting in â€ ¦ to honour the fact that these people sacrificed their lives for us .
It 's absolutely vital for Fifa to understand that
and I think a clear message going out of this house and from this government can make them think again .
"" Fifa 's decision to allow poppies to be worn on players ' black armbands will be a relief to the FA .
Cameron 's pledge to support the England team if they chose to defy the ban had come with the clear message that the final decision would be left to individual players after one of the prime minister 's aides stated : "" We are not going to start ordering the football team what they should do . ""
Yet the FA was not minded to go against the ruling regarding the poppy being placed on the shirt as this would have caused the match referee to suspend and then call off the game on Saturday .
An abandoned match at a 90,00 sell - out at Wembley would also have proved controversial and the FA had published a list of alternative ways it was honouring Remembrance Day to show it was doing everything it could .
These included poppies being sold inside the stadium , a poppy wreath being placed on the pitch ahead of kick - off , and a one - minute silence .
There was some opposition to the armband compromise within Fifa after the EDL 's rooftop occupation , a move that was also uncomfortable for the FA given the organisation 's political leanings .
The protestors were taken away in a police van .
Fifa 's reasoning for turning down the FA 's request to have the poppies on the kit was that it would "" open the door to similar initiatives "" across the world , while "" jeopardising the neutrality of football .
Players ' equipment are that they should not carry any political , religious or commercial messages .
The same regulations are applied globally , and uniformly , in the event of similar requests by other nations to commemorate historical events . """
2011-11-10,"Prince William is being deployed to the Falklands briefly early next year to serve with the RAF search and rescue helicopter service there , the Ministry of Defence has announced .
The move , which may stir Argentinian sensitivities , coming as it does almost at the 30th anniversary of the Falklands war – which took place shortly before he was born – meets the prince 's wish to be deployed like any other member of the armed services .
His brother , Prince Harry , served briefly in a live war zone in Afghanistan under conditions of a strict media blackout three years ago .
William will be based for six weeks at RAF Mount Pleasant , south of Port Stanley during February and March .
The prince has been training at RAF Valley on Anglesey as a Sea King helicopter co - pilot , involved in rescue operations for those getting into difficulties in Snowdonia or off the coast .
There are two such helicopters at the base .
MoD sources have said it would be wrong on many levels to accede to Argentinian representations that the prince should not serve on the islands , whose sovereignty they continue to dispute , despite their defeat in the war in 1982 ."
2011-11-10,"Once a year , the footballing fraternity is excused its position as grossly paid , sexually incontinent , firework - toting harbinger of our nation 's systemic breakdown and redeployed as the people 's â€ “ and , if one is being accurate , the Daily Mail 's â€ “ ethical barometer .
This November , the seemingly annual row over Remembrance poppies on the football pitch has escalated due to England 's friendly against Spain on Saturday and Fifa 's ban of political symbols on national shirts .
The association has finally conceded the England team may wear black armbands embroidered with the symbol following a number of high - level interventions , including a letter from Prince William .
To deny that the poppy exists in a political context , as well as a historical and cultural one , is to exhibit quite baffling levels of wilful ignorance .
It 's also insulting to the armed services themselves , given how eager politicians of various stripes are to co - opt them to their particular agendas .
Nevertheless , David Cameron decried Fifa 's initial prohibition as "" appalling "" at prime minister 's questions , while Ed Miliband , condemned by opposition to speak his truth via social networking sites , tweeted his outrage .
Though how he managed to focus on anything beyond the ginormous red splodge attached to his Twitter avatar remains a mystery .
The manner in which poppies are displayed by public figures â€ “ too early , too late , insufficiently ironed â€ “ invariably gets seized upon by the media .
But this year that has been heightened not only by the Fifa row , but by the prevalence of what has unfortunately become known as "" poppy bling "" .
Two jewellery companies now sell their enamel and crystal - encrusted versions of the traditional paper flower â€ “ as modelled by The X Factor judges â€ “ via the Royal British Legion 's website .
But , while celebrity endorsements and designer variants are expected to generate more than Â£40 m for the appeal this year , there is some controversy about the proportion of profits from the new range which will actually find its way back to veterans , with one of the companies reportedly offering a meagre 10 % .
The Royal British Legion itself is pragmatic about the profile - raising benefits of a Â£60 sparkler being photographed on Tulisa 's lapel , while pointing out that paper poppies still account for 90 % of funds raised by the appeal .
And those news organisations that bemoan the commercialisation of a simple symbol are also magpie - like in their commercial appetite for shiny newness , and relentless in encouraging their readers to pimp pretty much everything .
April Lockett , whose son Michael was awarded the Military Cross before his death in Afghanistan in 2009 , makes the contrary point far more succinctly when she asks : "" What 's wrong with buying a Â£1 paper poppy and putting that Â£100 in the tin ? ""
Remembrance commemorations have of course been controversial as early as 1919 , when many returning soldiers were appalled by what they saw as the glorification of a squalid and meaningless loss of life .
While politicians and the press may enjoy their annual flourish of moral certitude , I 'd imagine that there are as many reasons to wear a poppy as there are poppy - wearers , and that these reasons are complex and , occasionally , contradictory .
Last year , we asked readers of Comment is free to tell us their own reasons for wearing â€ “ or not wearing â€ “ one .
Some eschewed it , believing it showed support for Britain 's military involvement in the Middle East .
Some argued against conspicuous displays of charity , or what they considered to be jingoistic connotations .
Others felt it no longer spoke of patriotism , but rather had become an anti - war statement .
Our readers variously wore the poppy with pride , with pity , with sadness or with gratitude .
One former serviceman explained : "" I do n't wear a poppy with pride but as a duty to remember all those who died in so many stupid and wasteful wars where young men had to pay for the mistakes of politicians .
"" There was thoughtfulness and nuance in these answers that was far removed from the public discourse of what Channel 4 newsreader Jon Snow described as "" poppy fascism "" and confected outrage that the penguins on Frozen Planet dare to be naked of breast .
Indeed , armed forces charities identify a huge increase in public support over the past decade that would suggest most people are more than capable of separating the political context of military intervention from the personnel involved .
And poppy chatter can only distract from remembrance of the living : despite sterling work by charities , veterans continue to be over - represented among rough sleepers ; the suicide rate among younger ex - servicemen is four times the national average ; the effects of deployment on mental health , often compounded by alcohol misuse , can take years to surface , long after the limited Ministry of Defence support has ended .
The Royal British Legion is particularly concerned about early service leavers â€ “ soldiers who are discharged within four years of enlistment , often for disciplinary matters â€ “ who are most at risk of social exclusion when they return to civilian life .
These are mainly young men â€ “ between 2006 and 2011 , almost half of the recruits who had enlisted before their 18th birthday had left the armed forces without completing their minimum period of service â€ “ and the hidden victims of our military conflicts , swiftly disappearing from view .
It is no doubt simpler to feel sympathy for the returning hero nobly coming to terms with a prosthetic limb than it is a barely trained private returning to his destitute hometown in a worse state than he left it in , full of beer and rage .
But it would be fitting this Sunday if the nuance that the public brings to remembrance of the dead could be similarly afforded to the living ."
2011-11-27,"Five crew from a cargo ship are feared dead after a huge wave snapped the vessel 's hull in stormy seas off the coast of north Wales .
Two men were rescued by an RAF helicopter co - piloted by Prince William .
The 81-metre Swanland sank almost immediately 10 miles west of the Llyn peninsula following a distress call at 2 am on Sunday .
The body of one crew member has been recovered and there were fears for the fate of the five others as night fell .
While some of them were believed to be wearing survival suits , given sea temperatures of around 13C they would not be expected to survive in the water beyond six hours , the coastguard said .
Two other crew members were rescued from the water by an RAF Sea King helicopter dispatched from RAF Valley in nearby Anglesey .
The men were taken to hospital in Bangor .
A Ministry of Defence spokesman explained the role played by Prince William , who is based at RAF Valley as a flight lieutenant trained in search and rescue work .
He said .
"" It was a four - man crew – captain , co - pilot , radar operator and winchman – and he was the co - pilot .
The weather conditions were described as extremely bad , with poor visibility and strong winds .
"" The two rescued sailors said the ship had sunk quickly in stormy weather of gale force eight and above .
Ray Carson , the watch manager at Holyhead coastguard , said : "" One of the survivors said that there were five of them on deck at the time , wearing survival suits because of the conditions , and there were three either below or within the accommodation . ""
He described a huge wave rolling the ship , and she broke her back .
It was a catastrophic failure , and she obviously sank very quickly after that . ""
Carson said : "" The two men recovered from the water were brought here before going to the hospital .
I think they are OK and are just suffering from shock .
He said the rescue undertaken by the Sea King crew would have involved considerable skill : "" It would be quite a feat given the conditions .
As well as keeping a helicopter stable in the winds they had to winch someone down to a liferaft moving around in the water . ""
Prince William spent 19 months training as a search and rescue pilot , qualifying in September last year .
Two other cargo vessels in the area at the time played a key role in saving the two sailors .
A tanker , the Bro Gazelle , was very close to the Swanland when it sank and helped provide shelter and light before the helicopters and lifeboats arrived .
Another vessel , the Monsoon , spent the night searching for survivors .
The search , now covering 300 square miles , has been expanded to include four helicopters , from both RAF bases and the Dublin coastguard , as well as the Pwllheli and Porth Dinllaen all - weather lifeboats and two inshore lifeboats .
An Irish navy boat has also joined the operation .
Carson said two liferafts had been spotted in the water .
One was presumed to be empty , as it was the raft to which the survivors had clung .
The other has washed up under cliffs at the tiny island of Bardsey and was inspected at close range by a helicopter winchman who saw no signs of life .
The stretch of water is notoriously rough , he said .
In January 1991 another cargo ship , the Kimya , was capsized by giant waves in a similar location , causing its consignment of palm oil to leak into the sea .
The Swanland , with a gross weight of 1,978 tonnes , was carrying limestone from Raynes Jetty near Colwyn Bay to Cowes on the Isle of Wight .
Reportedly built in the Netherlands and registered to the Cook Islands , the ship is believed to be operated by a company based in Grimsby .
Last summer the Swanland came close to going aground on rocks at Lizard Point , Cornwall .
The crew ship suffered engine failure in high winds as it carried a cargo of stone on 20 August .
A rescue helicopter was put on standby and a lifeboat was at the scene but Falmouth Coastguard 's emergency towing vessel then managed to bring the ship to safety .
No - one was injured ."
2011-11-28,"The search has resumed for five Russian seamen missing off the coast of north Wales after their cargo ship sank in stormy waters .
Two men were airlifted to safety by an RAF helicopter co - piloted by Prince William after their vessel , the Swanland , went down in the Irish Sea about 10 miles west of the Llyn peninsula .
The ship was hit by an "" enormous wave "" in the early hours of Sunday morning .
Another person was later recovered from the sea and pronounced dead .
The Duke of Cambridge was called into action after the Swanland issued a mayday call at around 2 am on Sunday after its hull cracked .
The two surviving members of the eight Russian crew of the Cook Islands - registered vessel were pulled from the water clinging to liferafts soon after the alarm was raised .
Both men were taken to hospital at nearby Bangor as a precaution and were later discharged .
One of them was later identified as 26-year - old Roman Savin .
The Russian ambassador to London sent Prince William a letter of thanks for taking "" an active part in the rescue "" .
"" The two seamen were saved thanks to your selfless effort under the bad weather conditions , "" Alexander Yakovenko wrote .
"" Let me express to you and your colleagues my deepest gratitude for saving the lives of the Russian citizens . ""
The Russian press also hailed the rescue , a rare show of goodwill against the backdrop of poor UK - Russia relations .
"" Sailors from Nizhny Novgorod were saved by Prince William "" , read the headline in the mass - market Komsomolskaya Pravda , referring to the Russian city from which the sailors hail .
The newspaper interviewed one of the rescued sailors ' brothers , who said that because the prince was involved in the rescue he had been able to get news of the events .
When another relative went missing last year , he said the family sat and waited for information that never arrived .
"" There was no Prince William and no one talked about the accident in the news .
Now it 's very convenient â€ “ we can find out about Roma in the news , "" Alexei Savin told the paper .
The search was called off at 4.45pm on Sunday because of fading light , and was resumed at about 8.15am .
Ray Carson , the watch manager at Holyhead coastguard , said the search area had been calculated at about 100 square miles .
Two helicopters , one from the RAF and another from North Wales police , were leading the operation , supported by 11 coastguard teams .
The RAF aircraft was searching offshore areas , he added , while the police helicopter was focusing on the coastline .
Carson said : "" We have calculated a search area based on the surface targets we retrieved yesterday , and using their found positions we can predict the rate of drift for an object in the water .
That has refined the search to about 100 square miles . ""
He described the weather conditions as "" not particularly kind "" but said the searchers were refusing to give up hope despite the length of time the men had been missing .
"" There is always the odd chance , "" Carson said .
"" You may get the odd person who will buck the trend . ""
Gale - force winds that battered the Irish Sea during the early hours of Sunday may have caused the incident , coastguards believe .
The ship , managed by Grimsby - based Torbulk Ltd , had been transporting a cargo of limestone from Llanddulas , near Abergele , to Cowes , on the Isle of Wight .
Last August , the Swanland came close to going aground on rocks at Lizard Point , Cornwall .
The nine - man ship suffered engine failure in high winds as it carried a cargo of stone in the early hours of 20 August .
Torbulks managing director , Andy Williamson , said : "" Our thoughts are with the families of the missing crew and the deceased crew member . ""
Swanland was a â€ ¦ properly maintained seagoing ship .
She was fully and properly crewed with experienced seamen .
The ship was fully certificated and classed as well as being fully and properly insured at the time of her loss . ""
The UK Marine Accident Investigation Branch has commenced an inquiry into the sinking of the Swanland . ""
Torbulk is providing all assistance and will work closely with the MAIB as willing participants , keen to assist in determining the facts behind this tragic incident . """
2011-11-29,"When Grazia covered the Royal Wedding in May , the magazine took a photograph of the happy couple and altered it , first to remove Prince William , and then to make Kate Middleton more symmetrical â€ “ and , as it happens , thinner â€ “ by flipping the image of her left side onto her right .
Advertisers and the publishers of glossy magazines retouch pictures all the time .
The art of creating fantasy is central to their business .
The practice goes on despite concerns that it might harm people 's health by promoting unrealisitic expectations of body image .
When the UK considered legislation to label manipulated photos , the industry fought back , and some of its points were valid .
Photos are altered for justifiable reasons â€ “ to improve colour balance , sharpen contrast and remove marks resulting from dirty lenses , for example .
A simple label would be too blunt an instrument .
There is a better way .
Computer image specialists Hany Farid and Eric Kee at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire , US , have come up with a technique that measures how much a digital picture has been manipulated .
It ignores trivial tweaks that improve the picture quality and focuses on changes that most alter a person 's appearance .
The list of changes that are commonly made to photos in magazines and adverts is long .
Picture editors airbrush out the darkness under people 's eyes , the crow 's feet , the wrinkles on the forehead , sagging skin on the neck , freckles , blemishes , and unsightly hairs .
They remove folds of skin and body fat , elongate the neck and enlarge the eyes , or even move them slightly . ""
Retouching is becoming more extreme , "" says Farid .
"" They are no longer making perfect skin , they are making impossible human beings .
They are moving us , slowly and surely , in the direction of an over - idealised notion of beauty . ""
"" If you are exposed to these images all the time your notion of a baseline is gone , "" Farid adds .
"" They move the line of reality .
What is real becomes the published reality . ""
Farid and Kee wrote software that takes "" before "" and "" after "" images and works out how much the original has been changed , whether it 's an obvious trimming of the waist , for example , or a subtle softening of wrinkles .
To calibrate the system , the scientists asked hundreds of people online to judge before and after images on a scale of one to five , with one being a negligible difference and five being almost unrecognisable .
Writing in the latest issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Farid and Kee describe how the system can produce a simple and objective rating of retouched images that could flag the worst offenders to readers and help publishers and advertisers rein in excessive digital manipulation .
Adding a number from one to five to a doctored image is unlikely to diminish its impact on a reader , but the ratings might be useful alongside other attempts to make the industry more responsible in its use of retouching . ""
This should work both ways , "" Farid told the Guardian .
"" It can inform the public and deal with issues in advertising , but also inform publishers .
Retouching may get out of hand without them knowing .
It might incentivise them not to score a five with all their images on this scale . """
2011-12-01,"It takes a royal wedding to remind us that what is known – not always accurately – as the Anglican choral tradition is in cultural terms blockbuster stuff , but it 's important that we 've been reminded of that fact .
In England 's cathedrals and greater churches , there is an almost unbroken link between the early days of the monastery , with monks singing "" in quire "" , and the professional choirs of today , in most cases the same buildings , who sing repertoire which spans nearly 10 centuries .
And it is excellent news that Paul Mealor – whose motet Ubi Caritas was performed at Prince William and Catherine Middleton 's wedding – has taken his place within that living tradition .
Mealor was born in the Welsh cathedral town of St Asaph , and spent much of his childhood on the island of Anglesey .
From an early age , he sang in local choirs and played in brass bands and orchestras , learning the trombone at the same time as his father – an amateur musician – learned to play tuba .
Now aged 35 , Mealor has a strong sense of place , and , unlike other composers who are characterised by an idiosyncratic style , his work is marked by something outside of himself that is beautifully spatial and evocative of landscape .
His music breathes .
It breathes in the salt sea air of this island nation 's dramatic and diverse coastal landscape , and it breathes out a soulful response to the poetry of words .
But that 's what "" inspiring "" is all about .
Like all good composers , Mealor has exposed himself to diverse influences and put himself through a rigorous process of self - examination .
Initially self - taught , he worked with William Mathias ( another royal wedding composer ) , and then John Pickard and Nicola LeFanu enlarged his experience .
Equally important to the process of development was Mealor 's exploration of ethno - musical traditions such as Javanese gamelan and the sitar .
When you add Boulez , Stockhausen , and Cage to the equation , it 's hard to work out where the sound that we heard in Westminster Abbey in April comes from .
But it 's only hard to work out if we fail to understand how it is the broader and more challenging experiences of life that bring our own achievements greater integrity .
The wise man who built his house upon a rock did n't build a house that looked like a rock , but the rock ensured that the house remained standing .
I think that 's why Ubi Caritas worked so well that day .
It started life as a recording of Mealor 's composition ,
Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal ( words by Alfred Tennyson ) , which was sent to William and Kate after it had been given its first performance at the University of St Andrews where they had both , of course , been undergraduates .
It appealed to them so much that they wanted it performed at their wedding , but with a different text to suit the liturgy better .
The ancient Christian hymn Ubi Caritas was chosen and the composition re - formed to provide a moment of stillness and contemplation after so much drama and words .
Listening again to Mealor 's setting of the Stabat Mater , a 13th - century text that depicts Mary at the foot of the cross witnessing her son 's crucifixion , I hear something gently insistent in his music , like the rolling of waves against the shore .
Maybe that 's got something to do with his upbringing on the north Wales coast and his work now on the east coast of Scotland .
That gentle insistence characterises Mealor 's music and makes it accessible without actually having to label it "" accessible "" – surely the kiss of death for any self - respecting composer .
In other words , you can listen to Mealor 's music with a certain ease , but still be challenged to think hard about its meaning and context .
Theologians have chewed over the question about what it means to be made in the image of God for some 3,000 years , and it took a writer – a detective novelist indeed – to come up with the most useful answer .
Dorothy L Sayers , never shy of cutting through the brambles of theology to talk realistically about God , took a close look at the verse in the Book of Genesis that claims God created humankind in his image ( Genesis 1 : 27 ) .
She spotted that all we know of God up to that point in the Bible is that he was somehow responsible for creation , and so she concluded that to be made in the image of God means that we are most like God when we are being creative .
She set about working out how to apply this theory to the creative impulse in her most significant piece of popular theology
The Mind of the Maker ( 1941 ) , a book that still today has a lot to say to us about how we resist the culture of instant gratification that has been more destructive of humankind and its environment than any world war .
The encampment outside St Paul 's Cathedral has held a mirror up to society – and the church , too – but its mirror is part of a culture of blame designed to make people look ugly .
It 's asking questions that must n't be shirked , but it was gentle insistence that was the hallmark of Jesus 's ministry , and his persuasive personality was the thing that gave him the authority that made people wonder at him .
Art has a role to play in challenge , but it 's the gently persuasive kind that stands the test of time and works its way into the soul , winning hearts and minds for something better than the status quo .
For people of faith , that something better is God .
Dorothy L Sayers insisted that the work of the human maker had to be worthy of its role to reflect – however dimly – the work of the divine maker : "" No crooked table legs or ill - fitting drawers ever , I dare swear , came out of the carpenter 's shop at Nazareth .
Nor , if they did , could anyone believe that they were made by the same hand who made heaven and earth .
"" There 's a challenge to the destructive culture of instant gratification if ever there was one .
It takes me back to my school motto : Age quod agis ( "" Whatever you do , do it well . "" )
Paul Mealor has heard that challenge , but his music makes a challenge of its own to the church : that gentle insistence and calm persuasion are more Christ - like than the arguments of synods .
We sang Mealor 's Lux Benigna recently at Evensong at St Paul 's .
The text , by Gordon Graham , is a hymn to the Holy Trinity .
The warm texture of the voices evokes the "" kindly light "" of the title and the accompaniment is the landscape upon which God 's light shines .
As Sayers puts it , "" an earthly trinity to match the heavenly "" .
And , as the Book of Genesis says , it was very good .

2011-12-25,"The Queen and members of the royal family were due to visit the Duke of Edinburgh in hospital in Cambridge in an unwelcome deviation from their annual Christmas festivities , following the 90-year - old prince 's emergency heart surgery on Friday night .
By all accounts the family 's patriarch was chafing to return to Sandringham after the successful – and these days relatively routine – surgery to insert a metal mesh stent tube into his heart to improve the blood flow after he complained of chest pains before the weekend .
The hospital visit – the second in two days for the Queen and royal children , and the first for the royal grandchildren , including Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge – was anticipated to take place after the family , like much of the rest of the country , settled down to watch the Queen 's speech on the television after lunch .
The duke is under medical observation and may be kept at Papworth hospital for at least a couple more days .
In the longer term , his active participation in royal events is likely to have to be more closely reviewed .
The royal couple have been anticipating a busy year , with a tour across the British isles in the summer to mark the Queen 's diamond jubilee , a long weekend of public celebrations in London in early June and the Olympic Games later in the summer .
Until recently the duke was one of the busiest members of the royal family , attending more than 300 events a year , but in interviews last year to mark his 90th birthday he suggested he was beginning to wind down .
He has already shed some of his long - standing commitments .
When she recorded her annual Christmas broadcast at Buckingham Palace on 9 December , the Queen could not have realised how prescient or how close to home it would appear a fortnight later .
In it , surrounded by family photographs in the 1844 room at the palace , she spoke of the importance of family , particularly in times of crisis .
Her words related particularly to this year 's natural disasters in the Commonwealth – floods in Australia , the New Zealand earthquakes – but also to family hardships in difficult economic times , with the personal family bonds she was thinking of being happy ones , principally the two royal weddings , far from the crisis of the duke 's ill health .
She said : "" The importance of family has , of course , come home to Prince Philip and me personally this year with the marriages of two of our grandchildren , each in their own way a celebration of the God - given love that binds a family together . ""
Film of the weddings of Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge at Westminster Abbey in April , and of Zara Phillips to the rugby player Mike Tindall in Edinburgh at the end of July , was shown as she spoke .
The Queen said that in times of hardship people often found strength from their families , just as during crises communities come together to break down barriers – sometimes taking a tragedy to bring out qualities in individuals .
There was also footage of the Queen and duke touring Brisbane , which was inundated by flooding earlier in the year , and of Prince William viewing earthquake damage in Christchurch , New Zealand , in the spring .
A nativity play perfomed by the pupils of St Joseph 's Catholic infants ' school in Camberwell , south London was also featured .
"" For many this Christmas will not be easy , with our armed forces deployed around the world , thousands of service families face Christmas without their loved ones at home .
The bereaved and the lonely will find it especially hard .
And , as we all know , the world is going through difficult times , "" she said .
"" In the past year , my family and I have been inspired by the courage and hope we have seen in so many ways in Britain and the Commonwealth , and around the world .
"" We have seen that it is in hardship that we often find strength from our families .
It is in adversity that new friendships are sometimes formed and it is in a crisis that communities break down barriers and bind together to help one another . ""
Families , friends and communities often find a source of courage rising up from within . ""
Indeed sadly it seems that it is tragedy that often draws out the most and the best from the human spirit . ""
Larger than normal crowds gathered outside Sandringham parish church , hoping to see the new duchess attend the morning service with the rest of the family , during her first Christmas spent with them .

In the case of one individual who bumped into Prince William on a tour of Australia last year , it was a jar of Vegemite , the local equivalent of Marmite .
When William went on to Canada with his bride after the royal wedding last summer , the presents included a tartan waistcoat and a flying helmet .
All well received , no doubt , along with an extensive list of other presents given to Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge and to Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall during their overseas tours last year , which have just been published by St James 's Palace on their royal website .
The gifts range from the poignant ( some building fragments from the wreckage of the city of Christchurch , New Zealand , which William visited following last February 's disastrous earthquake ) to the predictable ( a wide - brimmed hat and a cricket jacket from his trip to Australia ) to the frankly bizarre ( the duchess received a tartan fascinator during the couple 's first official visit to Canada ) .
There were also gifts that come under the heading of "" you should n't have "" , such as a pair of caribou antler snow goggles .
The presents also included , more practically , three pairs of shoes from the Canadian ministry of foreign affairs and a quilt from the governor - general .
Prince Charles received a bottle of port , unsurprisingly , when he visited Portugal in the spring , and four bottles of olive oil and a cured ham from the ministry of the environment in Spain , a salt cellar and tray set from the Spanish royal family , and eight jars of marmalade .
When he visited South Africa in October , among other gifts , he was given a trilby hat and a set of Zulu spears and shields and the duchess was presented with a woven Zulu basket and some seaweed soaps ."

2012-02-01,"Argentina has stepped up its war of words with the UK , issuing an official statement criticising Prince William 's planned tour of duty of the Falkland Islands â€ “ wearing what Argentina angrily termed "" the uniform of the conqueror "" .
The statement , from Argentinian foreign ministry , under the letterhead : "" Argentina , a country with good people "" , was the strongest reaction yet to William 's six - week deployment as an RAF search - and - rescue helicopter pilot in the south Atlantic . ""
Prince William will arrive on the Malvinas islands as a member of his country 's armed forces .
The Argentine people regret that the royal heir will arrive on national soil in the uniform of the conqueror and not with the wisdom of the statesman who works in the service of peace and dialogue among nations , "" it said .
Patriotic fervour is high in Argentina as the 30th anniversary of its invasion of the islands approaches this April .
With the support of Argentina 's closest neighbours , the country 's president , Cristina Kirchner , has imposed a blockade of major South American ports against ships flying the Falklands flag and is threatening to cancel permission for the once - weekly flight that links Port Stanley with neighbouring Chile to overfly Argentina , cutting off the Falklands only commercial air link with the outside world .
The ban against ships prompted David Cameron to accuse Kirchner of having "" colonialist "" aims on an island population that wants to remain a British dependency .
In response , she accused Cameron of "" mediocrity bordering on stupidity "" .
William Hague , the foreign secretary , said on Tuesday that Britain is sending one of its most modern warships , the destroyer HMS Dauntless , to the Falklands .
He called the deployment a routine replacement of another warship , but also stressed that "" the Royal Navy packs a very considerable punch "" .
The Ministry of Defence described the move as a routine operation to replace the HMS Montrose , currently in the South Atlantic , although its capability to use its Viper anti - aircraft system to prevent just about any air attack on the islands has infuriated Argentina . ""
Argentina rejects the British attempt to militarise a conflict regarding which the UN has said both nations must resolve though bilateral negotiations , "" said the new statement .
Anti -
British sentiment is also being stirred ahead of Thursday 's premiere of the Oscar - nominated The Iron Lady , in which Meryl Streep plays Margaret Thatcher .
An online preview of the film shows the moment when Thatcher decided to send the British fleet to counter Argentina 's 1982 invasion .
"" It is shameful they are showing this film in Argentina , "" said one furious commentator who provocatively proclaimed that the US would never allow the screening of a film glorifying Osama bin Laden .
On the other hand , the 1982 invasion was described as "" one of the greatest moral swindles suffered by the Argentine people "" by another . ""
Do you even know what moral means , "" replied a Malvinas hardliner .
"" If you regret that we left the English with 31 ships out of combat then you never had any sense of morality . ""
The online disagreements reflect a noticeable recent shift from formerly unified public opinion on the issue of Malvinas , as the islands are known in Argentina .
Despite the passion most Argentines outwardly display , the most recent available poll from 2010 showed that 45 % had little or no interest in the Malvinas question .
Surprisingly , compared to previous hard - line positions , 24 % agreed to the idea of some kind of shared sovereignty solution .
Among women and young people the acceptance of shared sovereignty increased to 28 % .
A small group of 5 % even said the islands should remain British .
A column last week in the leftist daily PÃ¡gina/12 proposed that Argentina should offer the widest possible autonomy to the islands , still an unthinkable alternative at an official level .
"" We have to move away from the old sloganeering , "" says its author Gustavo Arballo , a 36-year - old law professor at the University of La Pampa in central Argentina .
"" We 're a nation of 40 million against islands with only a couple of thousand inhabitants , that 's like an 18-wheeler bearing down on a bicycle . """
2012-02-14,"Toy giant Mattel is launching Wills'n'Kate
Barbie dolls to cash in on their first wedding anniversary in April .
The mini versions of the royal couple – marketed as the William and Catherine Royal Wedding Giftset , and a snip at $ 100 – has perfectly captured in plastic the perma - smiles that come as standard issue for royal couples .
However , Mattel has decided to turn back the clock in terms of William 's bald patch , with the Barbie version sporting a full - on mop reminiscent of the kind of barnet that Wayne Rooney forked out tens of thousands of pounds to achieve .
Monkey has been unable to establish if a "" hair clause "" was inserted by the royal household as a condition of Mattel being given the go - ahead .
Whatever next – a Pippa Middleton Barbie doll , from the waist down only ?"
2012-02-14,"The Duchess of Cambridge spent her first Valentine 's Day since her wedding almost 8,000 miles from her husband , as she continued her charitable work at a "" dry bar "" in Liverpool that helps recovering addicts .
On what was her first engagement outside London without Prince William â€ “ who is on duty as an RAF search and rescue pilot in the Falklands â€ “ she told members of the public that flowers and a card from him had arrived in the morning .
At The Brink , which offers a supportive social environment for recovering addicts and where three - quarters of its staff have had problems with alcohol in the past , there was approval for the ease with which the duchess engaged with clients and others .
Among them was Rachael Lyons , 36 , from Toxteth , who told her story to showcase the work of the charity does .
She said a year ago she was at the worst stage of her alcoholism .
Agencies had been called in for her children "" because I was not being the parent I should have been "" .
Lyons , who will have been sober for 11 months on 18 February and now volunteers at the centre , said she "" felt wonderful "" with the future queen sitting in front of her , adding : "" She seemed really interested in what I had to say .
Never in a million years did I think this would happen to me .
It 's amazing . ""
St James 's Palace announced in January that the duchess was to become patron of five charities with which she intended to become actively involved on a regular basis , including Action on Addiction .
The others are the East Anglia Children 's Hospices , the Art Room , which aims to increase children 's self - esteem through art , the National Portrait Gallery and the Scout Association .
A palace spokesman said at the time : "" Action on Addiction was chosen because as she visited young people 's charities almost everyone working in the field pointed to addiction as a major problem and she wanted to help highlight that . ""
After her visit to The Brink , where she was served with a non - alcoholic cocktail named the Duchess and listened to a song from The Raucous Caucus Recovery Chorus , for recovering addicts , she travelled to Alder
Hey Children 's Hospital where she arrived to loud cheers and applause from hundreds of wellwishers .
At Ronald McDonald House Charities , which provides free "" home away from home "" accommodation at hospitals across Britain , she was introduced to families who use the centre on a long - term basis to stay close to children undergoing treatment .
"" It 's a fantastic place , "" said the duchess , who was presented with a Valentine 's Day card by 10-year - old Ethan Harris .
The self - made card , on red paper with painted spots , had a picture of his brother , Carson Hartley , on the front cut into a heart shape .
Inside he had written a poem which read : ""
You 're smiley like the sun , you 're bright like a star , you 're light when it 's dark and I love your spark .
"" Duchess 's coat is a sell - out The coat worn by the Duchess of Cambridge in Liverpool became a hit with shoppers in the hours that followed .
The Hobbs Unlimited Celeste wool coat was soon doing good business on the company 's website .
Gemma Cartwright , of OSOYOU.com , said : "" When I looked this morning it was available in two sizes , and it has sold out now . ""
The price was originally Â£369 , and people are suggesting that is what she paid for it , but when they were available earlier today the price had been reduced to Â£182 . ""
The coat flares from the hips and has a belt at the waist .
Cartwright said : "" Everything she wears is pitch - perfect on these occasions . ""
She often goes for A - line skirts , and the coat is A - line too , flaring out from the waist . ""
The Duchess also wore a black polo - neck dress from high street store Oasis , a royal aide said ."
2012-02-15,"Hollywood actor Sean Penn , fresh from branding Britain 's presence in the Falklands "" colonialist , ludicrous and archaic "" , has criticised Prince William 's deployment to the islands .
Less than 24 hours after he criticised Britain over the Falklands during a visit to Buenos Aires to see the Argentine president Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner , Penn accused the UK of "" insensitivity "" for posting the heir to the throne to the disputed south Atlantic territory .
Penn accused the UK government of geopolitical grandstanding after a meeting with Uruguayan president Jose Mujica in Montevideo , a visit undertaken as part of Penn 's role as ambassador at large for Haiti .
The presence of Prince William in the Falklands was an act of provocation , he suggested .
"" It 's unthinkable that the United Kingdom can make a conscious decision to deploy a prince within the military to the Malvinas , knowing the great emotional sensitivity both of mothers and fathers in the United Kingdom and in Argentina who lost sons and daughters in a war of islands with a population of so few , "" he said .
"" There are many places to deploy the prince .
It 's not necessary , when the deployment of a prince is generally accompanied by warships , to send them into the seas of such shared blood . ""
The double - Oscar winner condemned criticism of his earlier comments as "" hyperbole "" .
He said : "" My oh my , are n't people sensitive to the word colonialism , particularly those who implement colonialism . ""
The leftwing actor , who has previously called for the impeachment of George W Bush over the Iraq war , praised America 's longstanding alliance with the UK but said he felt criticism was necessary .
He added that he understood and respected the wish of people living in the Falkland Islands to remain British , but said Argentina and Britain needed to negotiate the sharing of the islands ' natural resources .
Tory MP and former army officer Patrick Mercer told the Daily Mail his comments were "" moronic "" .
He said : "" What on earth has this got to do with Sean Penn ?
He 's neither British nor Argentine and seems to know nothing about the situation judging by this moronic comment .
A good number of his movies have been turkeys , so I suppose we should n't expect much better coming out of his mouth . ""
After an earlier meeting with the Argentinian president , Penn urged Britain to join UN - sponsored talks over what he called "" the Malvinas Islands of Argentina "" .
He said : "" It 's necessary that these diplomatic talks happen between the United Kingdom and Argentina .
I think that the world today is not going to tolerate any kind of ludicrous and archaic commitment to colonialist ideology . ""
Tensions have been growing between Buenos Aires and London for months , as the anniversary of the start of the Falklands war approaches on 2 April .
British officials last week dismissed claims it was "" militarising "" the situation in the south Atlantic by deploying nuclear weapons nearby .
Argentina said it had intelligence that a Vanguard submarine had been sent to the area , and demanded to know whether it was carrying warheads .
Britain insisted the deployment of one of its most modern destroyers , HMS Dauntless , to the region was merely routine .
The arrival of Prince William in the Falklands for a posting as an RAF search and rescue pilot has further infuriated Buenos Aires .
And there were protests on the streets of the Argentinian capital after the website of Falklands newspaper the Penguin News ran a photo of FernÃ¡ndez labelled "" bitch "" ."
2012-02-16,
2012-02-23,"Britain should open negotiations with Argentina over immigration to the Falklands and the distribution of natural resources in the south Atlantic , the actor Sean Penn says .
In a Guardian article , Penn criticises Britain for sending a message of "" pre - emptive intimidation "" to Argentina after the deployment of Prince William to the islands .
Penn has written for the Guardian after he was criticised for describing Britain 's claim to sovereignty over the Falklands as "" colonialist , ludicrous and archaic "" .
The actor said his remarks had been distorted by the "" transparently corrupt and non - diligent propaganda machine "" of the British press .
But he said Britain should help Argentinians move to the Falklands . ""
The very people who suffered and fought most enduringly against this military junta in Argentina [ which invaded the islands in 1982 ] are the ones who today lead that country , and on behalf of their people seek simply a fair and re - established diplomacy in issues of the disputed islands ranging from immigration to natural resources , "" Penn writes .
Penn accuses Britain of slowing down moves on immigration after oil discoveries .
"" The legalisation of Argentinian immigration to the Malvinas / Falkland Islands is one that it seems might have been addressed , but for the speculative discovery of booming offshore oil in the surrounding seas this past year . """
2012-02-28,"As political editor of ITN , Tom Bradby has benefited from the reflected celebrity glory of his friendship with Prince William and Catherine Middleton : an association that brought pre - wedding interviews and an invitation to the marriage .
This may now have helped him to take a significant step up in the line of succession to presenting News at Ten , as last night he launched a current affairs discussion show immediately after the flagship bulletin :
The Agenda with Tom Bradby .
Bradby was given a studio audience and a set consisting of chairs arranged around a plastic table with several levels , like a Tibetan pavilion .
Four guests –
London mayor Boris Johnson , actor Jenny Agutter , writer Allison Pearson and TUC chief Brendan Barber – discussed three subjects that had trended in the previous 24 hours : the 30 % of the tax burden paid by 1 % of the workforce ; the alleged network of links between police and journalists at the Sun ; and the perennial post - Oscars topic of whether Britain needs a more robust film business .
The 2 - 2 gender split among the pundits was at least an advance on the still frequent 3 - 1 advantage for the boys but the format was otherwise conventional :
The Review Show with a remit larger than the arts , Question Time with less politics and a more redundant studio audience .
In what was perhaps a homage to the Oscar success of The Artist , the ranks of punters were required to listen silently , called into action only once for a show of hands on whether they thought the 50 % tax rate should be scrapped .
( They did n't . )
Even the veteran Question Time invites tweets these days .
Bradby looked and sounded smooth throughout but , if he needs a private discussion topic with his royal chums , should now be able to find shared ground in the frustrations of rigid rules and conventions .
The programme was hampered by the traditional TV difficulty of an over - packed bag – even within the first five minutes , Bradby was prefacing questions with "" very briefly now "" – but also by the cyclical difficulty of election law .
If Boris Johnson started making London mayoral campaigning speeches , The Agenda might have to have Ken Livingstone and Brian Paddick as guests next week .
This separation of powers was not helped by the fact that , in the south - east region , the local news immediately before The Agenda featured Boris in political action , launching his new bus in the capital .
But , every time a second version of this speech threatened to turn up in The Agenda , Bradby had to cut him off : "" Almost drifting into tribal politics , which we try to avoid on this programme ! ""
Boris 's signature hairdo looked unusually subdued , almost barbered , and this proved symbolic of his overall performance .
His one bad - taste crack – a borrowed gag about Meryl Streep playing "" Lady Gaga "" in The Iron Lady – prompted an apologetic intervention from the presenter and this atmosphere of fear and politeness is the programme 's weakness .
The panellists were gentle and supportive , complementing each other on their careers and views , although it was good reason that this genre of TV became known in America as "" shout shows "" , a description the best editions of Question Time still fulfil .
Opening the show , Bradby had promised to "" get to the heart of the stories making the headlines "" .
But , at the first attempt , he failed to get much of a pulse going , the fault not with him and his talkers but with a cramping format ."
2012-03-01,"Cosmpolitan magazine has something of a scoop to celebrate its 40th birthday issue â€ “ a saucy centrefold featuring "" naked "" pictures of "" Prince William "" and "" Prince Harry "" , reports the Daily Star .
But , hang on a minute , it 's not Harry and William at all !
They 're comedy lookalikes courtesy of snapper Alison Jackson .
Thank goodness for that . ""
To celebrate its birthday , Cosmopolitan , the magazine for smart young women , has given its readers the ultimate birthday present â€ “ naked Prince William and Harry lookalikes , "" says a spokesman .
Look at the size of those polo mallets ."
2012-03-02,"On the same day that Prince William arrived in the Falkland Islands last month , dozens of masked protesters took to the streets of Buenos Aires .
They carried wooden bats , chanted anti - British slogans and vandalised an HSBC bank .
Needless to say , Prince William 's deployment , coupled with the 30th anniversary of the Falklands war , has catapulted the Falklands into the headlines north and south of the equator .
Since the re - election of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner as president of Argentina , there has been a crescendo of rhetoric coming from Buenos Aires about the status of the Falkland Islands .
But more worryingly , the Argentinians have also started to turn this into action .
The Argentinian navy has intercepted , and even boarded , European fishing vessels operating under fishing licenses issued by the Falkland Islands .
Thanks to strong encouragement from Buenos Aires , Falkland - flagged ships are increasingly banned from many South American ports .
This has indirectly created a partial naval blockade around the Falkland Islands .
In a speech last month , delivered in front of a map of the islands imprinted with the Argentinian flag , Kirchner announced that Argentina will be formally complaining to the UN about the recent "" militarisation of the South Atlantic "" by the British .
This week two cruise ships were denied a port call in Argentina because they had previously visited the Falklands .
Argentina has put into question the future of the vital air link between Chile and the Falkland Islands .
All of this amount to what 10 Downing Street has described as a "" policy of confrontation "" pursued by Argentina .
Unlike the UK , which wants to let the status of the islands be decided by the Falklanders themselves , Argentina would like to annex and colonise the islands .
Exacerbating the problem , the Obama administration in Washington has publicly stated that it would like the UN to broker negotiations in order to decide what is best for the island 's inhabitants .
This policy plays right into the hands of President Kirchner and makes a mockery of the "" special relationship "" .
The war fought and won by Britain in 1982 to expel the Argentinian invaders was a victory for self - determination .
Margaret Thatcher 's leadership during the war ensured that the Falklands were liberated and that its inhabitants remained British .
David Cameron and William Hague have stood firm on the issue of the Falkland Islands , and they should continue to do so .
The recent deployment of the newest Type-45 destroyer , HMS Dauntless , sends a message of seriousness to the region .
Still more could be done .
During the cold war the US conducted an annual military exercise called Operation Reforger ( Return of Forces to Germany ) .
These exercises were designed to prove US ability to move conventional military forces rapidly from the US to Germany in the event of a war with the Soviets .
The MoD should consider conducting a similar exercise for the Falklands .
A British version could focus on rapidly deploying land , maritime and air assets in the event of a crisis in the south Atlantic .
Regular exercises on this scale will be expensive but this is about being prepared for the unexpected .
The Treasury needs to provide the MoD with the additional financial resources required .
Defending the Falkland Islands is not a departmental issue , it is a national issue .
The MoD should not have to bear the additional cost .
The UK must also factor cyber - warfare into any contingency planning for the Falklands .
Argentinian hackers have been known to hack into Falklands ' news websites in the past .
This likely will happen more often in the future .
It was rightly recognised in the 2010 strategic defence and security review that cyber - warfare will play a major role in future conflicts .
Military planners must prepare for this – and the defence of the Falklands is no exception .
The recent announcement by the Department for International Development ( DfID ) that they will fund the construction of an airfield on St Helena , an overseas territory in the south Atlantic , is also a positive development for British strategy in the region .
Similar to the airbase on Ascension Island , an airstrip on St Helena could be used as a military staging point during a time of crisis .
An airstrip on St Helena will add resilience to the UK 's south Atlantic contingency planning .
It is also a good example of DfID money being used to further British strategic objectives .
The construction of the airfield needs to be completed as soon as possible .
For its part , the Obama administration needs to make it crystal clear that they would back the UK in the event of a conflict .
They also need to reverse their position on UN mediation over the status of the islands .
It beggars belief that a country such as the US , with its deep - seated tradition of individual rights and instinctive suspicion of the UN , would want the UN to decide the fate of the islanders .
When Obama hosts David Cameron next month he should offer assurances of US military support to the UK in the event of a crisis – on the same level as provided during the 1982 Falklands war .
No British government could survive losing the Falklands , and rightly so .
This is why the islands still occupy a lot of time , resources and focus inside the Ministry of Defence .
With a heavily defended airbase at Mount Pleasant , battle - tested Typhoon fighter jets , and the occasional attack submarine patrolling beneath the waves , Argentina would be foolish to try anything .
But if , in the fog of war , the islands were occupied once again , this government must make it its policy to have the capability to take the islands back – and the MoD must be given the resources to do so .
Anything less is unacceptable .

2012-03-06,"At last year 's London marathon my mates dressed up as Prince William and Kate Middleton .
They captured the zeitgeist ( that 's German for "" spirit of the times "" , I knew roughly what it meant
but I had to look it up ) .
Within hours , they were featured on the front page of a national newspaper , websites and television news bulletins across the globe .
I watched in awe and just a little envy .
So this year I planned to capture the London marathon zeitgeist myself , with the aid of a simple headdress .
I was going to put on a headband with a vertical garden cane attached to it , supporting a 42cm - wide green vertical hoop â€ “ a bit like an angel 's fallen halo or Princess Beatrice 's royal wedding hat , but without the ribbony bits at the side and the toilet seat bit in the middle
and it 's a circle
not an oval and it 's green not pink
and it 's on my head , not hers .
Other than that , it 's practically identical .
Yes , this hoop , worn with my Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research hi - vis yellow / snotty - green vest , would be my passport to worldwide fame and recognition .
But what if there were more than one of us dressed like this ?
Specifically five of us dressed like this , the others with a black ring , a blue , a yellow and a red , running at first in a line and then merging ourselves into formation ?
Five Olympic rings at the Cutty Sark , five Olympic rings at Tower Bridge , five Olympic rings racing down the Mall with Buckingham Palace resplendent as a backdrop â€ ¦ Sport , London and the Olympic symbol would be brought together in one iconic image .
Journalists the world over would form a media scrum to use it and find out who was behind it .
My phone will be red hot with fevered interest :
RING Hello , Time magazine ?
The cover , why of course !
RING
RING
Le Monde ?
Le supplement ?
Naturellement !
RING
RING
RING Piers , how are you ?
You 're dropping Obama , you want me instead !
RING
RING
RING
RING Mr Jackson â€

if you insist , Peter â€ ¦ a sequel ?
Lord Of The Olympic Rings ,
oh , who 'll be playing me ?
Pacino ?
De Niro 's not free ?
OK !
RING
RING
RING
RING
RING
The London Olympic committee ?
Do n't tell me you 'd like me for the opening ceremony , just after Paul McCartney !
The closing ceremony ?
You want me to run in the Olympic marathon ?
What 's that ?
â€
¦
You 're going to sue me for infringement of copyright ?
I ca n't use the Olympic symbol or any form of guerrilla marketing ?
If I go ahead with it you 'll sue the charity as well ?
Ah yes , the Olympic logo copyright .
There is a whole library of downloadable leaflets you can view to make sure you do n't infringe copyrights if you 're planning an event or a campaign .
There are all sorts of combinations of words you ca n't use : Olympics , Olympiad , London , 2012 , Games , medals , breadknife ( OK , I made the last one up ) .
You ca n't use the symbol of the Olympic rings , the paralympic logo , the Olympic mascots Wenlock and Mandeville ( they 're keeping an special eye on those ) .
You ca n't use athletic images , representations of an Olympic - style torch and flame , even the colours of the Olympic rings .
Noel Edmonds will need some new shirts .
Bakers are even banned from icing cakes with the Olympic logo .
The plan by Britain 's leading cake decorators , British Sugarcraft Guild â€ “ to celebrate the 2012 games in icing and marzipan
â€ “ has been left in tatters after the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) banned it from copying any of its official symbols .
The IOC said : "" We very much regret that this situation has arisen "" â€ ¦ Cakes , arisen , they 've got a sense of humour at the IOC â€ ¦
but it 's a serious business .
Is it any coincidence that eight years after hosting the Athens Olympics , Greece 's economy is on its knees ?
There 's a punchline about the rest of Europe , but I 'm not going to say it .
The operating budget for the London Games is Â£2bn , and a big chunk of that has to come from sponsors .
Those sponsors demand exclusivity in return for their support so that the Games can make a profit and invest in sport in the UK beyond 2012 .
If you 'd forked out a fortune to associate yourself with the Games and then some idiot came along and got a load of publicity for free , you be pretty cheesed off .
So , I wo n't be running the London marathon with a coloured hoop on my head this year in support of the IOC â€
“ mainly because I do n't want to get sued .
But I really hope that at London 2012 , the balance between the sponsors and the sport is as it should be , and that the big brands allow athletes to speak freely rather than toe a boring corporate line .
I am hoping for great interviews â€ “ like the one with Rebecca Adlington after winning gold in Beijing saying "" I just want a hamburger and fries . ""
Or Usain Bolt talking about his preparation for breaking the world 100 m record : "" I never had breakfast .
I woke up around 11 , I watched television and then I had some [ chicken ] nuggets for lunch .
I went back to my room , I slept for two hours , I went back for some more nuggets and came to the track . ""
All this talk of food is making me hungry .
I 'd love a doughnut â€ ¦ one with green icing
and then another four with blue , black , red and yellow .

The Fiver has always imagined itself something of a frontiersman among the avant garde opinion - formers of the modern footballing salon , one of the real heavy - hitters of instant soccer think - blurt , up there with the likes of Tim Lovejoy , Elton Welsby , Prince William , DJ Spoony , pale men with overly detailed blogs , outspoken radio hosts who take a deliberately inflammatory position and pretend to be cross about baseless ephemera , unknown sideburned bands on Soccer AM , Terry Venables and his gigolo - beard , Tony Blair , Hugh Grant , Ray Winstone 's disembodied severed head and the non - stupid one in Oasis .
The Fiver it was who first invented the phrases "" two banks of four "" , "" if the keeper comes he 's got to deal with it , Ruud "" and "" that 's a stone - baked penalty "" .
Similarly , the Fiver was the first to point out that there are no easy games at this level , that sometimes all a top striker needs is for one to go in off his elbow and that , win or lose , get the rub of the green with the referee 's decision or not , feel disrespected by an opposition manager 's mind games or otherwise , every single person currently involved in football as a player , spectator or official is destined to die within a relatively short timespan , their thoughts , deeds and opinions rendered entirely meaningless by the unarguable fact of eternal oblivion .
With this in mind , the Fiver considered itself unflappable - pre - flapped in fact , already reversing the engines on its latest perfectly crystallised spurt of football - spout and preparing to come up with the exact opposite in half the time and double the words .
Until this morning that is , when resurgent fourth - place certainties Arsenal , expertly stewarded by unsackable wise old owl Arsene Wenger , having recently proved themselves masters of Spurs and Milan , announced the signing of a new contract by Czech midfield genius and all - action Mr Consistency Tomas Rosicky , who has in recent weeks with his own brawny hands dragged a young team out of … no , sorry , even the Fiver 's reversible opinion ducts have begun to digest themselves trying to take all this in in one go .
"" It 's a great honour to sign a new deal with Arsenal , "" Rosicky read off an envelope this morning .
"" It 's felt like home since I arrived six years ago , "" he added , putting on his espadrille house - shoes and positioning his favourite kitten fur armchair somewhere near the halfway line .
Boosted –
yes boosted – by the news , Arsenal will play Newcastle tonight at the Emirates with Mikel Arteta and his Action Man hair once again available for selection and Aaron Ramsey ready to return after ankle - knack .
Yossi Benayoun is also back , not that it generally makes much difference either way .
Newcastle will be without Peter Lovenkrands who has a ruptured thigh muscle and could be out for the season .
An Arsenal win will leave them just a point behind super soaraway crisis - club Tottenham .

THE DAY No1 ""
The margin of victory does not impress me "" - FC Basel / Basle / Baaarl boss Heiko Vogel comes over all Shania Twain while considering Bayern Munich 's 7 - 1 win over Hoffenheim on Saturday .
Basel meet Bayern in Big Cup on Tuesday .
PERSPECTIVE , PLEASE !
With an entire point separating both clubs and only 10 matches each remaining , it 's probably no exaggeration to suggest that Manchester United have all but wrapped up this season 's Premier League title at the expense of their noisy neighbours City .
Well , obviously they have n't , but that certainly seemed to be the opinion of the City fan shown on Match of the Day 2 yesterday ; a grown man whose face was such a study in abject grief you could be forgiven for assuming he was watching Bambi 's mother get shot , rather than a football team he quite likes go 1 - 0 down against Swansea in their 11th - last match of the current campaign .
With football fans having long been renowned for their sense of perspective , we dread to think what the blubbering eejit in question was ready to do upon hearing that Manchester United had wrapped up a win against West Brom to leapfrog jittery City and replace them at the top of the table .
"" We 've been at the top for six months .
We might not be at the top now but United had an easy game , "" sniffed Roberto Mancini , whose side 's comparatively difficult encounter was against a side that had been several places below West Brom at lunchtime yesterday .
Manchester City 's poor away form is clearly a source of grave concern to fans , so desperate to win a title , that many of them recently extended a warm welcome to a treacherous Argentinian scrote upon his return to the club 's reserves .
Presenting recent statistics in a way to make them look as bad as possible , the Fiver can reveal that City have lost four and drawn two of their last eight away matches in the Best League
In The World , failing to score more than once in any of them .
Of course having said that , the same supporters should keep some perspective .
There 's no shame in Manchester City being completely outplayed by Swansea , a club that 's spent £ 15 m on players in the time it 's taken Man City to spend 33 times that in their bid to win the league .

2012-03-20,"Sean Penn , Roger Waters and Morrissey may have all spoken out in favour of Argentina 's claim to the Falkland Islands , but the British people remain doggedly determined to defend the South Atlantic archipelago , according to a Guardian / ICM poll .
As the 30th anniversary of the conflict approaches and with Prince William fresh from his "" routine "" posting , 61 % of voters say that "" Britain should protect the Falklands so long as the islanders want protecting , no matter what the cost "" .
That is against just 32 % who believe Britain must "" be ready to negotiate with Argentina over the eventual handover "" of this "" distant outpost of a forgotten era "" .
This near two - to - one margin suggests that Argentinian complaints about "" imperialism "" and "" militarisation "" have failed to carry across the 8,000 miles of ocean that separate the islands from the British "" mainland "" .
There is a clear overall majority for defending the Falklands across all social classes , regions and nations , save for Wales .
But even there protecting the Falklanders at all costs receives 49 % backing , as opposed to 39 % of support for negotiating a handover .
Women are somewhat less hardline than men , who split 66%-29 % against negotiation , but female voters nonetheless endorse the "" no matter what the cost "" commitment to the islanders by a substantial margin , of 56 % to 35 % .
Not surprisingly , it is Conservative voters who are most strident in their determination to protect the fruits of Margaret Thatcher 's military victory .
By 78 % to 20 % they reject moving towards a negotiated handover .
Labour and Liberal Democrat voters are somewhat more evenly split , but even here there are respective majorities of 54 % and 60 % for defending the islanders at all costs .
Only among the very youngest voters , aged 18 to 24 , is there a strikingly different picture .
Among this cohort – none of whom were born when Argentina invaded the islands on 2 April 1982 – 49 % support negotiations with a view to handover , as opposed to just 39 % who take the contrary view .
Among all other age groups there is a 60 - 70 % majority for standing firm on sovereignty .

2012-03-21,"The kidnapping of Briton Judith Tebbutt and the murder of her husband David in a luxury resort on Kenya 's Indian Ocean coast turned what should have been the holiday of a lifetime into a nightmare .
It also dealt a severe blow to a tourism industry that just a year before was basking in renewed interest after the engagement of Prince William and Kate Middleton in a rustic lodge near Mount Kenya .
After the attack on the Tebbutts , and the kidnapping of a French woman from the island of Manda near Lamu , several countries , including Britain and the US , issued travel advisories , warning their citizens not to visit parts of Kenya that are close to Somalia .
In October , Kenya sent its troops into Somalia to push the Islamist rebels of al - Shabaab , which it blamed for the kidnappings , away from its borders .
Al - Shabaab denied any involvement but threatened to retaliate and there have been several grenade attacks since the incursion .
Mohammed Hersi , chairman of the Mombasa and Coast Tourist Association , said the effect of the kidnappings and travel warnings "" had affected bookings .
He added that tourism operators were working hard to explain that most areas in Kenya are safe .
"" We 've been able to explain that the advisory and travel ban does not affect Malindi ( a coastal resort ) and Mombasa , "" he said .
Hersi was very happy that Tebbutt had been released and hoped there would be no more kidnappings , saying Kenya had moved quickly to improve security .
Security threats are just one of several factors dampening tourism .
Kenya is due to hold presidential elections within 12 months and these will be the first polls since the disputed 2007 ballot which claimed the lives of around 1,200 people .
The tourism industry has also been affected by the euro debt crisis .
The number of visitors from China and other non - traditional markets has been rising , but Hersi said these could not replace traditional countries like Britain , Germany , Italy and France .
The Kenyan hotelier TPS Eastern Africa , which operates luxury hotels , lodges and tented camps under its Serena brand , said last week however that demand had increased last year .
But it said there had been a decline in the last quarter of 2011 .
The tourism minister Najib Balala told Reuters Kenya expected revenues to fall this year ."
2012-04-16,"The former husband of Coronation Street and Holby City star , Tina Hobley , has joined the growing list of new phone - hacking claimants suing Rupert Murdoch 's News International .
Steve Wallington , who was married to the actress between 1998 and 2001 , has launched a legal action against News Group Newspapers , the News International subsidiary that published the now closed News of the World , via his solicitor Chris Hutchings , who says he also has two other actions pending .
Hutchings is also acting for an unnamed BBC journalist who he said was "" quite seriously hacked "" and was also pursued by the private investigator Derek Webb , who was hired by News of the World to follow celebrities , politicians and royalty such as Prince William .
The solicitor added he has two other cases in the pipeline involving members of the public .
News International could face almost 200 more civil claims from alleged victims of News of the World phone hacking , with the process of settling the new cases expected to last at least another year .
The high court was told in February that 14 new claims had been issued and that there were another 180 cases involving individuals "" who have approached solicitors that we know about and have said they are considering claims "" .
Earlier on Monday , it emerged that Bobby Davro and his former wife Trudi have become the latest public figures to sue the former publisher of the News of the World over alleged phone hacking .
The comedian filed a civil action under his real name , Robert Nankeville , at the high court in London last week against News Group Newspapers , and Glenn Mulcaire , the private investigator who used to work for the News of the World .

2012-05-27,"Activists who were rounded up before last year 's royal wedding are challenging the Metropolitan police in the high court on Monday in a case that could have implications for the way the Queen 's diamond jubilee celebrations and the Olympics are policed .
Scores of people were arrested and many more detained before the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton last April , leading to claims that police were unlawfully criminalising legitimate protests before they had taken place .
Lawyers acting on behalf of 20 of those involved are seeking a judicial review of the police action at the high court .
Sophie Priestley , of Tuckers Solicitors , is representing two environmental campaigners who were detained at what police described as an "" environmental training camp "" near Heathrow , the day before the wedding .
She said : "" It appears that the police were determined to restrict or remove the sight of protest from central London during the royal wedding .
With the Queen 's jubilee celebrations and the Olympics approaching it should not be forgotten that the real strength of our heritage and tradition lies not in the spectacle and pageantry of events like these , but rather in the rich history of our hard - won democratic freedoms . ""
In the months leading up to the wedding , a series of demonstrations by students , trade unionists and others saw hundreds of thousands of people take to the streets to protest against government cuts .
There were outbreaks of disorder and in one case student demonstrators attacked a car carrying Prince Charles and his wife Camilla .
Senior police chiefs said at the time they were planning to take pre - emptive action to ensure there was no repeat of the trouble .
Lynne Owens , then assistant commissioner at the Met , told journalists : "" We have both overt and covert policing activities on going and we will prevent people coming to London to cause criminal behaviour if that is their intention . ""
The police raided several squats and activist camps in the days before the wedding and stopped other protesters on the morning of the event .
Sophie Naftalin , of Bhatt Murphy solicitors , is representing 15 protesters who were pre - emptively arrested on the day of the wedding .
They were all detained until after the wedding celebrations but no further action was taken against them . ""
This matter touches upon the most important of constitutional rights â€ “ namely the right
to free expression â€ “ which is fundamental to any properly functioning democracy , "" she said .
"" While our clients recognise the difficulties of policing large - scale operations , it is nevertheless clear that the police must strike the right balance between maintaining public order and allowing people to express their political beliefs . ""
Two of those taking action in court on Monday were detained at Sipson environmental camp near Heathrow and say they had no intention of protesting .
Police claimed the camp was occupied by "" extreme leftwing or environmental groups "" and claimed there was evidence to suggest paint bombs were being made at the site .
No paint bombs were found and lawyers say police had no evidence of any link between the camp and any royal wedding protests .
All those detained were later released without charge .
Theodora Middleton , one of the activists , said : "" We simply can not have a situation where the police are allowed to break into people 's homes without any evidence that a crime has been committed .
This kind of harassment , based it seems on crude political profiling , is entirely inappropriate in a democratic society . ""
Daniel Randall , who was detained near Trafalgar Square on the day of the demonstration , said : "" This was a very explicit manoeuvre by the state to prevent people raising dissenting voices . ""
Another of the protesters , Hannah Eiseman , said : "" It seemed like they had their script and once we were on the wrong end of that , we were being treated like criminalsâ€
¦ any possible dissent was being cleared and human rights were being suspended briefly to make way for pageantry .
Pageantry is all well and good , but human rights are way more important . """
2012-05-29,"The Duke of Cambridge and his brother Prince Harry have spoken movingly of their mother the late Diana , Princess of Wales , in an interview for US television .
Prince William revealed his deep sadness that his mother was not there to witness his wedding , and had never met his bride , Catherine Middleton .
"" I sort of prepared myself beforehand so that I was sort of mentally prepared …
I did n't want any wobbly lips or anything going on , "" said William , 29 .
He added : "" It 's the one time since she 's died , where I 've thought to myself it would be fantastic if she was here , and just how sad really for her , more than anything , not being able to see it . ""
I think she would have loved the day
and I think , hopefully , she 'd be very proud of us both for the day .
I 'm just very sad that she 's never going to get a chance to meet Kate . ""
Harry said : "" I think she had the best seat in the house , probably .
But yeah , she would have loved to have been there "" .
The 27-year - old said he had been "" massively nervous "" on the day .
"" Everybody was nervous , "" he recalled .
"" The whole thing was a bit of a blur to be honest because there was God knows how many millions or billions of eyes focused on us .
Luckily , mainly those two [ William and Catherine ] . ""
During the programme , the princes also pay tribute to their grandmother .
The pair were interviewed by Katie Couric , of ABC News , as US networks compete for coverage of the British royals during the jubilee .
Piers Morgan is set to anchor rival network CNN 's coverage of the jubilee weekend 's events .
The ABC documentary , The Jubilee Queen With Katie Couric , aired last night , examined the relationship the princes enjoy with the Queen .
Prince William revealed how she urged him to ignore protocol and make his wedding as personal an occasion as possible , given the global media attention .
Of the guest list , he said : "" I was given a list in the first meeting of 777 names , and not one of them on there I knew .
So it was a bit daunting and it was like , well , that seems to be the guest list 's sorted , but no room for friends or family .
And I was n't too happy about it .
She [ the Queen ] said , ' Ridiculous .
Get rid of the list .
Start from your friends . '
""
His brother said that to him and his brother , she was just "" granny . ""
"" In a small room with close members of the family , then she is just a normal grandmother .
Very relaxed .
"" She obviously takes a huge interest in what we all do , that 's her children as well as her grandchildren .
She wants to know which charities we 're supporting , how life is going in our jobs and such .
So you know , she has a vested interested in what we do .
"" When we were young it was very easy to take our grandmother for granted .
She was just a grandmother to us .
It 's only really sort of been over the last sort of five , eight to 10 years that I 've actually really learned to sort of understand and accept the huge deal that she is around the world , especially within the UK . ""
Having recently undertaken his first overseas tour to Jamaica , Belize and the Bahamas on behalf of the Queen , Harry , two years older than his grandmother when she became monarch , said he could not imagine taking on such duties at such a young age . ""
No , not a chance , "" he said .
"" But this tour itself has been a brief insight as to what she had to deal with at a very young age … what she 's achieved and what she 's done and at the age of 25 … confronted with the world 's media .
And you can see it in her face now .
You can see it in the way that she parades herself is just immaculate .
And she 's learned it from all the years of experience . ""
Prince Harry added his grandmother had shown a remarkable ability to adapt through the years .
"" She 's managed to get the family to move with the times , and I think that 's incredibly important , "" he told Couric .
"" You ca n't get stuck in a sort of an old - age situation when everything else around you is changing .
So you have , you have to go with it . ""
Buckingham Palace announced on Tuesday that the Duke of Cambridge has been made a Royal Knight of the Order of the Thistle by the Queen .
He is already a Knight of the Garter , while his younger brother does not hold either title .
A St James 's Palace spokesman said of William : "" It 's his 30th birthday this year and also the diamond jubilee and the Queen felt it was an appropriate time to bestow the honour . ""
Alan Titchmarsh 's "" Elizabeth , Queen , Wife , Mother , "" is due to be broadcast on ITV on Friday ."

2012-06-04,"Student leaders have attacked top Scottish universities for their "" awful "" record on admitting impoverished students .
National Union of Students ( NUS ) Scotland said several Scottish universities were among the worst in the UK for attracting poorer students .
St Andrews University – a popular destination for English public school students after it was attended by Prince William – recruited just 13 people from the most deprived backgrounds , out of 7,370 undergraduates in 2010 .
The study , compiled using freedom of information requests , found that two other elite universities – Edinburgh and Aberdeen – had only 91 and 51 poor students respectively in 2010 , out of total undergraduate numbers of 17,570 and 12,195 .
The universities defended their record , insisting they were increasing outreach work , bursaries and targeting of poorer students and were actively investigating new ways of improving recruitment .
St Andrews said it offered places to 25 % of applicants from the poorest backgrounds , against about 10 % of better - off applicants .
It said too few poor students achieved the right entrance grades , leaving universities competing with each other to get them to take up places .
Robin Parker , president of NUS Scotland , disputed that defence , saying that since Scottish universities could not charge tuition fees to Scottish students , it should be easier to attract poorer students than for English universities .
Yet UK - wide statistics show English institutions still did better .
Parker said the figures raised significant questions for the universities involved just as they faced new measures on widening access from Scottish government ministers and the Scottish Funding Council later this year . ""
While these statistics are truly awful , the silver lining is that they show that we can make really good progress with only small numbers of students , "" he said .
The NUS Scotland statistics were calculated using the Scottish index of multiple deprivation , which measures many types of poverty including income , health , employment and educational outcomes , by tracking those students who came from the country 's 20 % most deprived areas .
Many areas of Glasgow , parts of Edinburgh , Dundee and North and South Lanarkshire come within that 20 % band of most deprived areas .
However , only 2.7 % of St Andrews students came from the 20 % most deprived areas , against 5 % for Edinburgh and 3.1 % for Aberdeen .
Glasgow and Dundee universities did comparatively better by recruiting just over 10 % of their students from that band .
Parker said the new NUS figures did not take account of students coming from comparatively poor areas of England , Wales or Northern Ireland , but UK - wide data confirmed a similar low level of recruitment by Scottish universities there too .
A St Andrews spokesman said it had set a £ 13 m fundraising target for its bursaries and scholarship programme and staff would be "" working their socks off "" at summer schools for potential students this year .
He said NUS Scotland was guilty of a "" gross oversimplification "" of the problem facing universities : the root problem was equipping and helping poor students get the right grades and overcome their inhibitions to applying to elite universities .
"" If this challenge continues to be laid solely at the door of universities , it will never be properly met , "" he said .
"" It requires a concerted national effort on health , employment , housing and a culture of attainment at all levels of Scottish education to equip young people with the grades they need to gain entry and to succeed at university . """
2012-06-04,"The plan was simple : find 2,012 open spaces and protect them in perpetuity for public recreation as part of the combined diamond jubilee and Olympic legacy .
The national charity Fields in Trust would find the fields ; private sponsorship would pay for the plaques , bunting and toolkits sent to participants so they could organise a fete .
Prince William would be the project 's patron , a trial run for taking over as the charity 's president when the Duke of Edinburgh retires next year .
The Olympic organisers would cheer the whole thing on .
But with the jubilee festivities under way , the organisers of the Queen Elizabeth II Fields Challenge still have more than 700 fields to find – with royal and Olympic boroughs among those that have yet to come up with a site .
The royal county of Berkshire sits at the top of the tree with 18 open spaces lined up and two days of Field Day festivities at Streatley , where a trust raised £ 750,000 to protect a field from developers .
But seven of the other nine English places with royal patronage , including Kensington and Chelsea and Windsor , both home to royal palaces , have yet to designate a single one .
Of the five London Olympic boroughs , only Greenwich and Tower Hamlets have signed up , although Newham says it is keen to be involved .
Alison Moore - Gwynne , the Fields in Trust chief executive , said she was disappointed at the lack of progress .
"" A legacy is surely something that is handed on to the next generation and brings tangible benefits .
These fields can play a part in so many issues including community cohesion , antisocial behaviour , health and the environment .
"" Private landowners have also proved reluctant to join in .
Lord lieutenants were approached for help but so far the Duke of Westminster , one of Britain 's richest men and a family friend to the Windsors , is the only big landowner to have named his jubilee field , Westminster Park in Chester .
Moore - Gwynne is planning a concerted effort to recruit more like him after the jubilee weekend .
"" Many of them have had ancestors who have done a great deal and do n't feel they can do more .
But yes , I am slightly disappointed , "" she said .
Large urban local authorities , on the other hand , have proved enthusiastic : Edinburgh 's Labour and SNP - controlled council has named 22 fields , putting it in second place , one field behind the Conservative - led Shropshire county council .
Glasgow has 20 fields , Newcastle a dozen , and Birmingham , Bradford and Wolverhampton at least five each .
The royal borough of Windsor and Maidenhead said it had decided not to join the challenge in order to concentrate on its 13 acres of jubilee woods , to be planted by volunteers in the autumn .
A Kensington and Chelsea spokesman said its parks managers had decided the borough 's parks "" did not require the additional levels of protection that would come from inclusion in the Fields Challenge "" .
Hackney , one of the Olympic boroughs to have rejected the scheme , pointed out that it already has 62 green spaces .
"" We will be gaining part of the world - class Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and residents will benefit from these facilities for years , "" said Jonathan McShane , council cabinet member for health and culture .
"" Our current portfolio of high - quality parks and track record of investing in them meant we decided not to nominate a space for the Fields Challenge . ""
The Queen , the Duke of Edinburgh and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will unveil the QE2 plaque at Vernon Park in Nottingham on 13 June .

2012-06-21,"The Duke of Cambridge turns 30 on Thursday and , according to aides at St James 's Palace , will be marking this milestone in a "" low - key "" and "" private "" fashion .
So , no big birthday bash , apparently , is planned for the second in line to the throne – though he could well afford one .
Reaching his fourth decade brings rich rewards for Prince William , and that 's not just his grandmother 's gift of the Order of the Thistle , the highest honour in Scotland , whose insignia he proudly displayed for the first time during Saturday 's trooping the colour .
Rather , he is now entitled to inherit a substantial sum from the estate of his mother , the late Diana , Princess of Wales .
Some back - of - the - cigarette - packet calculations put it at around £ 10 m .
In her will Diana left a net estate of £ 12,966,022 after inheritance tax of £ 8,502,330 was deducted .
It comprised stocks and shares and jewellery , dresses , other personal belongings and cash from her £ 17 m divorce settlement .
Royal wills are not normally made public .
But in this case , details of her will were changed by a variation order in the high court just months after her death in 1997 and both the original will and the new will were made public by executors .
Originally Diana had stipulated that her sons , Princes William and Harry , would be entitled to inherit at the age of 25 .
Under the changes , a clause was included that raised the age at which they could ask for the capital in full to 30 .
With shrewd investment , some commentators have estimated the estate could now be worth around £ 20 m – half for William , and half for his brother when he reaches 30 in September 2014 .
St James 's Palace declined to confirm or deny any details , and said about Prince William 's birthday : "" He 'll be spending it in a low - key private fashion . ""
He has been busy this week on a course connected to his work as an RAF search and rescue pilot , but will apparently be taking time out to mark his birthday .

2012-06-29,"Public funding to support Prince Charles rose by 11 % during the past financial year , taking the contribution from the taxpayer to almost £ 2.2 m , it was disclosed on Friday .
The accounts , an annual glimpse into the finances of the royal household , also showed that the Prince of Wales ' spending rose by 3.6 % to over £ 20.2 m .
They cover the period in which the wedding between Prince William and Kate Middleton took place , the cost of which royal aides have said was shared between the families of the bride and groom .
The accounts also showed an increase of 3 % in the income that the Prince of Wales receives from the Duchy of Cornwall , the estate given to the heir to the throne to provide him with a living , to £ 18.3 m .
The increased contribution from the public purse has largely been spent on the official overseas tours undertaken by Charles , his wife Camilla , the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry , according to Clarence House .
The government justified the increased cost of the foreign travel , saying that the tours were necessary to promote "" foreign policy objectives and UK interests throughout the world "" .
Anti - monarchists , however , criticised the rising bill at a time when "" the country is facing sweeping cuts to public spending "" .
They also disputed that all the royal heir 's travel was for official purposes .
Clarence House said total spending on official travel for the five royals came to £ 1.31 m , a 22 % rise on the previous year .
The government was keen to point out that the overseas visits by the royals were "" of real value to the country "" .
Simon Fraser , the head of the Diplomatic Service , said : "" The visits of the Prince of Wales have supported British business , investment and development goals and promoted our values around the world . ""
Charles and Camilla travelled almost 48,000 miles to and from official engagements at home and abroad , according to Clarence House .
They undertook 804 domestic and foreign engagements , alone or together , during the year , and hosted almost 9,500 people at events at royal residences , according to the accounts .
Aides added that the travel bill covered tours royals have been asked to undertake by the government .
They said that the increased bill was due to several factors , identifying in particular more trips abroad by the five royals and the "" longer distances travelled during those visits "" .
They singled out visits such as the Prince of Wales ' trips to the US , Kuwait , Qatar and Saudi Arabia , as well as tours with the Duchess of Cornwall to Norway , Sweden and Denmark in March "" in the first of their overseas tours to mark the Queen 's diamond jubilee "" .
However , the accounts did not disclose the cost of the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge last year .
Prince Charles ' spokesman , Paddy Harverson , said most of the expense was covered by the bride and groom 's families , and that "" it would be rather impolite to give away the cost of a wedding "" .
The government footed the bill for some aspects of the ceremony at Westminster Abbey , such as security .
Royal aides also were also quoted as saying it would be "" impolite "" to give a cost for the Duchess of Cambridge 's wardrobe .
It falls under expenditure for official duties and charitable activities – a total of £ 9.8 m for the year .
This week , tabloids claimed that Charles pays for the cost of the clothes she wears for official engagements and that the bill was in the region of £ 35,000 a year .
The Prince of Wales ' tax bill rose marginally from £ 4.39 m to £ 4.49 m .
The accounts disclose a slight increase in staff who work for the prince and his family .
They include two valets , a butler , an equerry , a master of the household , three chauffeurs , 10 house managers and housekeepers , five chefs and kitchen porters and 19 gardeners and estate workers .
Republican campaigners called for an urgent review of royal finances and an "" end to the ' something - for - nothing ' culture in the royal household "" .
Graham Smith , chief executive of Republic , said "" Year on year , Charles continues to spend more public money on travel , much of which is for personal trips .
When the country is facing sweeping cuts to public spending , Charles Windsor wilfully helps himself to whatever travel funds he wants or feel he needs . """

While in the UK we 've not heard that much from Ellie Goulding since her performance at Prince William 's wedding last year , in America she 's becoming a household name .
While her song Lights hit the heady heights of No 49 over here , in America it 's currently at No 6 .
While work on her second album is underway with rumoured collaborators Calvin Harris and Swedish House Mafia , Goulding has started to tease her new direction , uploading a cover of the Weeknd 's High for This in May and now Hanging On .
A cover of a song by Active Child , it was introduced by Goulding as "" the beginning of my new journey "" , which seems to suggest she 's ditched the acoustic guitars in favour of something more compelling .
What the song could have done without is Tinie Tempah , who destroys any sense of atmosphere with his monotone delivery .
Things are n't helped by the fact that his verse includes the lines "" There 's something about your cleavage , now I ca n't put my fingers on it "" and , much worse , "" I spat a verse , she sang a song , she broke my heart
I took some Gaviscon "" .
Seemingly inspired by a more lo - fi aesthetic , the video â€ “ premiered here
â€ “ shows footage of Goulding having a late night wander interspersed with shots of her staring intensely at the camera .
Gaviscon fan Tinie Tempah is nowhere to be seen , probably a blessing .

2012-08-17,"Two teenage girls are recovering after being rescued from the sea by a helicopter piloted by Prince William .
A rip current dragged the girls out to sea off the coast of Anglesey while they were body boarding .
Prince William 's Sea King , Rescue 137 , was landing when it received the emergency call .
He took off again and was hovering the aircraft over the girls within 38 seconds , the Royal Air Force said .
The girls , aged 13 and 16 , from Herefordshire , had been on Cymyran beach , Rhosneigr .
The 13-year - old was understood to be body boarding when her sister swam out to help her .
One of the girls , who did not have a body board , was exhausted and dipping below the surface as the helicopter prepared to lower the winch .
The winchman , Master Aircrew Harry Harrison , told the BBC : "" When I got to her , the elder girl was clearly exhausted and was going under the water for what was the very last time . ""
The girls were taken to Gwynedd hospital in Bangor for treatment .
Harrison said : "" We never know what we 'll face when we 're called out .
Sometimes its just a twisted ankle or a broken bone , but this was one rescue where we truly did arrive in the nick of time and managed to save two young lives .
"" The crew had been called to a similar incident at Rhosneigr minutes earlier when a child and three adults were carried out by a rip tide but managed to get safely on to rocks .
The co - pilot , Flight Lieutenant ' Schmoo ' Smith , said : "" This was a remarkably swift rescue , taking around 38 seconds from take - off until we arrived on scene . """
2012-09-14,"Here we go again ...
now it 's Kate , Duchess of Cambridge , getting the paparazzi treatment , just as her late mother - in - law did 15 years ago and
her brother - in - law did just a couple of weeks ago .
No wonder the Duchess and her husband , Prince William , are reported to be furious .
With memories of Princess Diana in mind , they must feel history is repeating itself .
The statement issued by the Palace this morning , calling the privacy intrusion "" grotesque and totally unjustifiable "" , makes an explicit reference to Diana : "" The incident is reminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of Diana , Princess of Wales , and all the more upsetting to The Duke and Duchess for being so . ""
Clearly , British newspapers and magazines refused to publish the topless pictures of Kate because it would be a blatant breach of the editors ' code of practice to do so .
The photos were obviously taken without the Duchess 's consent , and they were snapped in a place where she and her husband had , to quote the code , "" a reasonable expectation of privacy . ""
As for "" the public interest "" , there is no earthly way of constructing an argument to justify publication on such grounds .
The Kate pictures are different from those involving Prince Harry , who was pictured last month while naked in a Las Vegas hotel .
Though The Sun advanced a public interest defence for publishing the Harry picture , it was very specific to the circumstances .
Aside from its argument that the pictures were "" in the public domain "" by virtue of having been published on many websites , the paper claimed there were security implications and questions about his position in the army .
"" We believe Harry has compromised his own privacy , "" it said .
That paper thin argument to justify publication would not be possible in relation to the Kate pictures .
Nor is it a matter of newspapers giving special privileges to royalty .
One key decision taken by the Press Complaints Commission about sneak pictures of people in a private place dates back to 2001 and involved the DJ Sara Cox .
She was pictured nude on a private beach on an island in the Seychelles .
The PCC did not adjudicate because it convinced the offending paper , The People , to apologise , and Cox went on to sue the paper , which eventually paid her and her husband £ 50,000 in an out - of - court settlement .
Similarly , Amanda Holden and her then husband , Les Dennis , were paid £ 40,000 in an out - of - court settlement after the Daily Star published sneak photographs of them .
Neither were legal precedents , because they did n't go to trial .
The editors ' code certainly did draw a line between public places and private places , offering a large measure of protection for the latter .
It is interesting that the pictures of Kate and William are appearing in a French magazine because France has very strict privacy laws .
Presumably the magazine , Closer , is willing to take the legal heat should the prince and his wife decide to sue .
It is also sobering to recall that Diana 's death in 1997 occurred in France when she was being pursued by the paparazzi .
( Incidentally , she was not pictured topless .
She was pictured in a bikini while pregnant - by newspaper staff photographers - and there were many other bikini shots taken by paparazzi over the years ) .
Finally , some callers to radio phone - in programmes this morning have indicated that there could be a public backlash should any British publication dare to publish sneak pictures of the Duchess .
I would doubt that .
Hypocrisy in this matter runs deep .
But the British - based version of Closer - published by Bauer Media - had better watch out .
Despite its French namesake being owned by a different company - Silvio Berlusconi 's Mondadori - it could just find itself being punished by a boycott ."
2012-09-17,"Chi , the Italian magazine that has published intimate pictures of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge , was criticised six years ago by the royal princes for running a photo of their dying mother .
In July 2006 , Chi carried a black - and - white picture of Princess Diana receiving oxygen in the wreckage of a car in the Paris underpass where she died in August 1997 .
The picture was widely described as "" tasteless . ""
At the time , Prince William and his brother , Harry , issued a statement condemning publication , saying "" a low has been reached . ""
The Daily Mail said the princes ' highly emotional outburst revealed just how much they had been hurt .
All the British tabloids attacked the publication . ""
Shame on you , "" said The Sun , calling it "" the lowest of the low "" .
The Daily Mirror 's headline said : "" Our deep hurt "" , while the Daily Express described the image as "" grotesque . ""
The magazine 's then editor , Umberto Brindani , defended his decision to publish by saying the photograph was "" touching "" and "" tender "" but not offensive .
There is an echo of his defiant stance in the reaction of the current editor , Alfonso Signorini , to criticism for publishing 18 pictures of Kate , the Duchess of Cambridge , sunbathing topless .
Signorini said he published the 26-page "" exclusive "" edition in order to show how the royal family in Britain had modernised ."
2012-09-19,"The court victory secured on behalf of Prince William and his wife certainly does n't prove that the French privacy law is so good that we should have one here .
Just the opposite .
Closer magazine 's decision to publish a set of blatantly intrusive pictures of the royal couple illustrates the law 's weakness as a brake on press misbehaviour .
It may be suggested that it is not the law itself that 's the problem - it is the insufficiently punitive range of penalties that lead France 's celebrity magazine publishers and editors to defy it so regularly .
In fact , the potential penalties for offenders - according to Legal Week - are severe : one year in jail and a fine of â‚¬45,000 ( Â£36,000 ) .
Corporate offenders , incidentally , could be fined up to â‚¬225,000 ( Â£180,000 ) .
But judges in France do n't impose anything like the maximum penalties .
My researches suggest that no - one has ever received a jail sentence ( which , I understand , would be a suspended anyway ) .
Instead , most offenders are ordered to pay relatively modest fines .
Why should that be ?
Well , it does n't take a moment to realise that the French judiciary are being pragmatic because , in spite of the law , they value press freedom more than they do privacy .
As I note in my London Evening Standard column today , can you imagine the outcry if an editor or photographer was sent to jail for invading someone 's privacy ?
Do we really think it would be a proportionate punishment to imprison an individual - even if he or she lacks manners and morals - for causing another person embarrassment ?
I do not doubt that some people would be only too delighted to see certain editors doing porridge , but surely they would need to have been guilty of something more venal than publishing a picture of a topless woman ?
The latest episode of royal intrusion illustrates once again the virtues of self - regulation over the law .
At its best , it works .
I agree that , as so often , it has been to the benefit of the royal family ( though , behind the scenes , the Press Complaints Commission will say that it benefits plenty of celebrities and other people caught up in news stories too ) .
Of course it needs to be improved and , hopefully , Lord Justice Leveson will recommend a better system .
It may need some kind statutory backing , but it wo n't amount to statutory regulation .
Whatever the case , as the French experience indicates , a law would never work .
Finally , let 's not forget the internet .
No national law , no European - wide law , is going to prevent the downloading and uploading of material that may well involve privacy intrusions .
Perhaps we all need to rethink our attitude to privacy in the digital age .
Day by day , whether we like it or not , life is getting more transparent ."
2012-10-10,"Opening the new England football academy in Burton - on - Trent Tuesday , Prince William reportedly warned Ashley Cole , the Chelsea defender currently under fire for tweeting his considered view that the FA were a # bunchoftwats , that if he continued to be "" a naughty boy "" he would end up having his Twitter account taken off him .
Interesting expression .
Our future king used it in its modern , knowing incarnation : directed at an adult to signify a wry , possibly ironic understanding that their behaviour has not been altogether above reproach , that they have in some way overstepped the mark : "" Who 's been a naughty boy , then ? "" begs a "" nudge , nudge "" .
Actual children , of course , may no longer be called "" naughty "" .
Despite the fact that the Oxford dictionaries give as an example of their primary definition of the word ( "" badly behaved ; disobedient "" ) the phrase
"" You 've been a really naughty boy "" , any teacher or parent who uses it in this way today would be guilty of being naughty themselves .
For at least a decade , educationalists and child psychologists have been arguing that calling children "" naughty "" or "" bad "" in effect labels them , potentially damaging their self - esteem and adversely affecting their development .
Children who are regularly told they are naughty
will , the reasoning goes , eventually begin to believe that is what they are .
It 's theoretically fine , on the other hand , to describe specific behaviour as naughty or bad ; that way you label the act , not the child .
So "" What you did is very naughty "" is largely considered OK ; "" You are naughty "" is not .
( Some creches , however , have banned the word altogether : "" You did something silly "" or "" You made a bad choice "" are preferred , and "" the naughty step "" has become "" the thinking step "" . )
Needless to say , the debate has angered the political - correctness - gone - mad brigade .
No such qualms , obviously , afflicted Sir Salman Rushdie â€ “ then plain Salman â€ “ when , as an advertising copywriter , he coined the slogan "" Naughty ... but nice "" to promote fresh cream cakes ; the resulting TV commercials , starring the likes of Barbara Windsor and Les Dawson , were popular in the 70s and 80s .
But Rushdie 's use of the word plays on the notion of guilty or illicit pleasure suggested by its second main definition .
As the Oxford dictionaries again put it , "" naughty "" these days
â€ “ perhaps mainly â€ “ means "" mildly rude or indecent , typically because related to sex "" .
Think Cosmo top tips , or Fifty Shades of Grey .
In time , this secondary definition looks likely to supersede the primary .
Which , applied to Ashley Cole , may not be entirely inappropriate ."
2012-11-20,"As a royal PR initiative it was meant to highlight Prince William 's role as a search and rescue pilot and publicise a new official website dedicated to the public life of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge .
Alas , there were red faces at the Ministry of Defence and St James 's Palace after pictures of Flight Lieutenant Wales , as he is known at work , were launched on the website showing sensitive information in the background .
It swiftly became apparent that in some of the 10 pictures , taken by an MoD photographer at RAF Valley , in Anglesey , north Wales , where the prince is based , information was visible on computer screens captured in the shots .
But by then the pictures were already up on the royal site , and had been distributed to and appeared on many news websites , including the Guardian 's .
The photographs , which included those of the prince sitting at a computer with a document on his desk , and another of him attending a briefing , had to be replaced and new versions launched with sensitive details pixelated out .
As a precaution , the MoD has been forced to reset the user names and passwords of some RAF staff on its internal system .
A St James 's Palace spokeswoman said four of the photographs had to be taken down and had been replaced on the website .
She added that the the pictures had been supplied by RAF Valley . ""
Any security issues are a matter for the MoD , "" she said .
In a statement , an MoD spokesman said : "" A number of photographs of Flight Lieutenant Wales were taken while on duty working as a helicopter search and rescue pilot at RAF Valley on Anglesey , Wales .
The passwords and user names shown have now been reset as a precaution and we are satisfied the images do not contravene security regulations .
"" All the photos have been now amended and reissued .
Media organisations are kindly asked to use these images "" .
The photographs show the prince getting the teas in and making up his bed in the sparsely furnished bunkroom at the base where he is an on - call RAF search and rescue ( SAR ) Sea King helicopter pilot .
Away from red carpet duties , the 30-year - old 's life is spent in "" readiness state "" , working 24-hour shifts where he must be no more than 60 seconds away from his helicopter at any time .
The pictures have been released on the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge 's website , which will promote their public life and is further evidence of the couple 's augmented role as "" working royals "" taking on a larger share of the royal diary .
According to the website : "" SAR aircrews expect to fly into conditions from which others are fleeing , meaning they often find themselves flying in gales or through clouds , driving rain and poor visibility "" .
Certainly , in the photographs entitled "" a typical day "" , rain is much in evidence as the prince is seen carrying out pre - flight checks on his helicopter .
Wall art adorning the spartan bunkroom where he sleeps while on call appears to be of a satellite photograph of yet more weather of the type he has undoubtedly become accustomed to during his north Wales stint .
Downtime is spent playing computer games , with those favoured usually having a military theme , such as Call of Duty , the MoD explains .
In the base 's canteen , the health - conscious prince is seen sharing a meal with his crew â€ “ eschewing the chips favoured by his colleague in favour of salad , it would seem .
William has been based on Anglesey since starting his training in January 2009 , and graduated as a fully operational search and rescue pilot in September 2010 .
He qualified to take command of a Sea King mark 3 this year .
During his time there he has been involved in many dramatic rescues , details of some of which have leaked to the media .
The most recent to have made headlines was his team 's rescue of a 16-year - old girl in August , who had been swept out to sea in Silver Bay , Anglesey .
It took the prince and his crew just 38 seconds from receiving the call to reach her .
Speculation is mounting , however , that the prince will shortly leave his RAF role to take on the mantle of full - time royal engagements .
The duke and duchess and Prince Harry will now have their own private office , funded by the Prince of Wales .
It will move from St James 's Palace , where it shares space with Charles 's private office , to Kensington Palace this month .
The duke and duchess will , eventually , take over the Kensington Palace apartment that used to be occupied by Princess Margaret ."
2012-11-21,"The oft photographed Duchess of Cambridge was given an opportunity to hone her skills behind the camera lens on her recent official tour of south - east Asia and the south Pacific .
Using her own camera , she captured rainforest scenes during her visit with Prince William to the research station at Danum valley in Malaysian Borneo .
Her photographs have been published on the couple 's new website .
Kate , who is said to be a keen photographer , chose to shoot in black and white for many of the scenes as she attempted to convey the scale of the jungle .
An endangered Borneo orangutan is shown in silhouette in one artistic shot .
The couple were lucky enough to see one of the apes close up during their brief visit to the Royal Society research station .
The duke is a fellow of the Royal Society .
During a private walk with the duke close to the research station , the duchess photographed a jungle clearing .
The accompanying caption describes how "" in rare clearings , when the sunlight does shine through , it creates the most spectacular effect through the architectural structures of the trees and leaves "" .
In another , she concentrates on a tall tree above the canopy , attempting to convey its size .
"" It does not even begin to give a sense of the size of these jungle giants , which are truly one of nature 's most awesome sights , "" reads the caption .
During their visit , William and Kate were taken up a 130 ft rainforest tree in harnesses , and walked along a 300-metre - long canopy bridge .
A picture of Mount Kinabalu , which at 4,095 metres above sea level is the highest point on Borneo , was taken from their plane as the couple flew to the Solomon Islands .
Another aerial shot is of a palm oil plantation , which the royal party flew over on their way to the research station in Sabah , Malaysia .
The photographs , which are the copyright of the duchess , were published as the couple 's new website was launched this week .
It will promote their public life and is further evidence of their augmented role as "" working royals "" taking on a larger share of the royal diary .
St James 's Palace would not give the make of the camera used by the duchess , but did say it was a "" pocket - sized digital camera "" and not a DSLR ."

2012-12-06,"With a smile and a wave the Duchess of Cambridge left hospital on Thursday to the undoubted relief of her husband and also of the international news crews camped outside in the bitter cold throughout her three - night stay .
She emerged from the King Edward VII private hospital in central London looking relaxed after receiving treatment for hyperemesis gravidarum , an acute form of morning sickness .
As journalists shouted to inquire how she was feeling , she replied "" much better "" as she briefly posed on the hospital steps for a photograph with Prince William , 30 , at her side .
The duchess , 30 , who is less than 12 weeks pregnant , will now rest at the couple 's London home in Kensington Palace .
She was admitted to hospital on Monday afternoon after becoming unwell at her parents ' Berkshire home .
Just hours after her admission , two Australian radio DJs impersonating the Queen and Prince of Wales duped hospital staff into divulging intimate medical details .
The embarrassed hospital has condemned the hoax as "" pretty deplorable "" and "" journalistic trickery "" .
But Prince Charles seemed to make light of the prank at an engagement at HMS Belfast on Thursday . ""
How do you know I 'm not a radio station ? ""
he joked to reporters .
Asked about the prospect of becoming a grandfather , he said : "" I 'm thrilled , marvellous .
It 's a very nice thought to become a grandfather in my old age . ""
He added : "" I 'm very glad my daughter - in - law is getting better , thank goodness . ""
The duchess has pulled out of her two planned royal engagements this weekend
â€ “ a Centrepoint Royal Albert Hall fundraiser and the British Military Tournament .
William is due to attend them without her .
The couple 's diary also includes the London premiere of The Hobbit film on Wednesday , but it is not yet clear whether Kate will be well enough to attend ."
2013-01-05,"Prince William rented a remote African lodge , singer Seal took a helicopter to a private igloo , and Tom Cruise borrowed the Eiffel Tower and its restaurant for the night .
And last year a flux of newly engaged celebrities flaunted some of the biggest diamonds ever seen on a finger , from Angelina Jolie 's Â£500,000 ring to Keira Knightley 's at Â£40,000 .
All very well for the rich , but now even the average Mr who wants his Miss to be a Mrs is catching on to the fad for a gesture when they pop the question , creating a new industry out of planning the proposal .
Websites and agencies that have become prolific in the US are springing up here .
Welcome to the latest trend â€ “ do n't start worrying about the wedding yet , it 's all about the proposal .
"" It 's gone utterly crazy , "" said Daisy Amodio , director of the Proposers , a UK firm which started out last year to help people plan their romantic gesture .
"" Men are getting competitive , they want their mates to be impressed as well as the girl .
They are trying to outdo each other .
A lot of it is people looking for an idea , they 'll pay for one that suits them and go away happy to carry it out .
At the other end we organise the whole thing , plan it , research and find a venue .
"" We launched in May and have been overrun by demand .
A lot of it is following celebrity trends , and the movies of course .
In days gone by you might have gone for a walk in the park to propose , but that 's not enough now .
"" About half of our clients come to us with their own idea , which is great because it does need to be personal , but for some of the proposals a guy could n't do it on his own . ""
Like the one who wanted to be a knight in shining armour , we had to find him a castle and decorate it and persuade him out of wearing the complete helmet .
We 've done singers and horse - drawn carriages in Horse Guards Parade .
My partner has been in New York arranging one there , it 's all very romantic and everyone cries .
They are all normal people who use us , who just want to make it special and something to be remembered .
I 'm really proud of them all
and we have n't had one who has lost their nerve or one that has said no .
"" Amodio is working on her first flashmob proposal , something she thinks will become more popular .
"" We 're getting loads of women , gay people now too , quite a lot of gay women especially . ""
The pressure is on to come up with something spectacular .
The words can be written on Casino playing cards ( Robbie Williams ) or in flaming torches on the beach ( property developer Nick Candy ) .
Think location , think buildup , think romance , think a whole lot of rose petals .
Overblown shows of sentiment are never going to be everyone 's cup of tea , however .
They are not , for example , for Dame Helen Mirren , who this weekend declared that she and her partner , Taylor Hackford , are not "" remotely romantic "" .
The actor added : "" I 'd be completely horrified if Taylor gave me a Valentine 's Day card . ""
And Amodio does recommend that people think carefully about making a public proposal :
"" It 's not to everyone 's liking "" , as a baseball fan found out last year when he proposed in front of 10,000 people in a US stadium , along with a viewer who asked US TV show host Ellen DeGeneres to propose on his behalf on national television â€ “ they both scored a "" no thanks "" .
For the sceptics among you thinking that a romantic gesture does not a long and happy married life make , remember the late Johnny Cash , who proposed to June Carter live on stage in Canada and got a "" yes "" â€ “ and 35 years of marriage ."
2013-01-07,"Six years ago , I wrote a piece for the Guardian about a phenomenon that had been bubbling away for a few years , and had started to become inescapable .
It all seems rather quaint now : Prince William allegedly taking part in a "" chav - themed fancy dress party "" at Sandhurst ; Oxford colleges hosting "" chav bops "" ; the privately educated creators of Little Britain entertaining their devotees with comedic representations of the so - called underclass .
But there it was : to be living on an estate , and in receipt of benefits , and possibly out of work , was to not just to be fair game for Oxford undergraduates , the future king and a certain kind of TV comedian , but the butt of a huge national joke .
Some of us wondered where exactly what was briefly known as "" The New Snobbery "" was headed .
We now know .
Its cultural aspects were merely the tip of the iceberg – as the Labour party engaged in the rebranding of social security as "" welfare "" and its ministers raged against "" benefit cheats "" , something poisonous was being embedded at the core of our national life .
While the Conservative party grimaced through a fleeting modernisation , it sat there , ready to be picked up by a Tory - led administration and taken to its logical conclusion .
Tuesday sees the Commons vote on the welfare uprating bill , via which the government wants to cap increases in working - age benefits at 1 % and in the process portray Labour as – to quote the Observer 's Andrew Rawnsley – the party of "" skiving fat slobs "" .
Throughout the coming year , the grim provisions of the Welfare Reform Act will be upon us , snatching away money from hundreds of thousands of people , and commencing the uncertain era of universal credit .
It is a token of the government 's agenda that in moving in on just about anyone who receives state help ( apart from those electorally vital pensioners ) , they are simultaneously lionising hard - working families while snatching money off them – which is the basis of Labour 's creditable opposition to the bill , though that does not quite let them off the hook .
Most of the opposition seem incapable of challenging the "" strivers v skivers "" dichotomy , and are therefore leaving one modern shibboleth unchallenged : that even with swaths of the country economically dead , to be on out - of - work benefits is to be degenerate , and unable to grasp the soul - cleansing wonders of toil , however low paid .
Meanwhile , the same people who rage against the nanny state have become its loudest advocates .
Last week , in partnership with a thinktank called the Local Government Information Unit , Westminster council came up with a report that was seemingly based on a neo - Hogarthian caricature of people on limited incomes – again , many of them actually in work .
The text said this : "" The increasing use of smart cards for access to leisure facilities , for instance , provides councils with a significant amount of data on usage patterns .
Where an exercise package is prescribed to a resident , housing and council tax benefit payments could be varied to reward or incentivise residents . ""
To translate : they should be able to pack anyone who is obese and on benefits off to the gym , on pain of having their money cut .
Just before Christmas , the Tory backbench MP Alec Shelbrooke issued a private member 's bill proposing that all benefits aside from pensions and those covering disability be delivered via a "" welfare cash card "" that would only cover "" priority purchases "" and outlaw "" luxury goods such as cigarettes , alcohol , Sky television and gambling "" .
He was echoing noises made by people at the top of government : in June 2012 , in a speech on future welfare reform , David Cameron floated the idea of paying benefits "" in kind "" .
Iain Duncan Smith is working on the same idea for "" problem families "" .
This is nothing to do with practical policy : it is about grandstanding on the basis of crass stereotypes , and the Victorian idea that only the affluent should be allowed pleasure – not to mention a weird definition of "" luxury "" .
Last week came my favourite outburst so far .
Free - market oracle John Redwood said in response to news that bookmakers are situating the majority of their addictive fixed - odds gambling machines in areas where most people do n't have much money : "" I put it down to the fact that poor people believe there 's one shot to get rich .
They put getting rich down to luck and think they can take a gamble .
They also have time on their hands .
My voters "" – he 's the MP for Wokingham , in Berkshire – "" are too busy working hard to make a reasonable income . ""
Note that distinction between people who are poor , and those who are "" too busy working hard "" , as if he has not bothered to think about who it is who empties his office bin .
In almost everything we now hear about economic disadvantage , there is the same belief , embodied in such government schemes as the Work Programme , that 40-plus years of deindustrialisation matters not , and to be one of the economy 's losers is n't about being a victim of forces beyond your control , but character failings .
This , it 's often said , is what the majority of the public believe , but perhaps things are more complicated .
Last week , the TUC put out the results of a survey by YouGov .
On average , people apparently think 41 % of the social security budget goes to those who are unemployed , and 27 % is spent on fraudulent claims , whereas the true figures are 3 % and 0.7 % respectively .
However , while 48 % of people support the welfare uprating bill , 63 % think benefits should go up in line with wages , prices or both .
In other words , many people are confused , and their answers depend on how you phrase the questions .
Funny , that .
You will not turn this unprecedented tide of nastiness and bigotry by using statistics .
If it can be stopped , that will happen via arguments built on emotion , and a conversation about exactly what kind of country we ought to be .
A shame , perhaps , that Rowan Williams has left Lambeth Palace : he did a pretty good job of opposing a lot of what the government was doing to the benefits system , and apparently brought most of his church with him .
A pity , too , that whereas past attacks on the welfare state sparked revolts that were expressed culturally just as much as politically , people who write TV dramas , plays , songs and novels seem to have little interest in what 's happening .
Over the next 12 months , some of the fundamentals of Britain 's future will become clear .
In the meantime , consider the words of writer and artist John Berger , written 20 or so years ago , but pertinent today : "" The poverty of our century is unlike that of any other .
It is not , as poverty was before , the result of natural scarcity , but of a set of priorities imposed upon the rest of the world by the rich .
Consequently , the modern poor are not pitied but written off as trash . """

2013-03-26,"The future is as unclear for Prince William â€ “ the duke of Cambridge , or Flight Lieutenant Wales as he is known in the RAF â€ “ as it is for many of his search and rescue colleagues .
Based at RAF Valley on Anglesey , William is nearing the end of his tour of duty .
It is thought he may carry on at Valley until 2016 , taking time off for his royal duties and forthcoming family commitments .
Quite what he will do once the search and rescue service is privatised is not known .
He could be transferred or he could become a full - time royal .
An RAF spokesman said only that aircrew serving in search and rescue would be "" redeployed elsewhere as a normal part of their career pattern "" .
Bristow , a Texas - based leading provider of helicopter services to the offshore energy industry , has won a Â£1.6bn contract to provide search and rescue , which has been mainly carried out by the RAF and Royal Navy for more than a century , from 2016 ."
2013-04-05,"I 'm excited .
I 'm off to the National Portrait Gallery to see that terrifyingly regal portrait of King George V ; you know the one – the great - great - grandfather of Prince William .
I bet the late royal portraitist Sir Oswald Birley would be proud to know his picture of the king was still on display for thousands to see every day .
Birley painted another portrait around the same time that has had a much less distinguished fate : that of the Yorkshire businessman and former lord mayor of Leeds , Sir Charles Lupton .
But Lupton 's fame has faded so much that the portrait has been gathering dust in the vaults of Leeds art gallery for 60 years .
However , some dogged research by my senior students at the Australian college where I teach history has helped unearth a very modern – and very royal – family connection that may see the portrait given a second shot at getting the audience it deserves :
Sir Charles Lupton is the great - great - great - uncle of Prince William 's wife , the Duchess of Cambridge , the royal consort formerly known as Kate Middleton .
When my wife and I were watching Kate 's elegant wedding to Prince William , we were rather put off by the constant and snooty assertions of British "" royal correspondent "" James Whitaker ( sadly now no longer with us ) that Kate "" simply did not have the necessary gentry connections "" required to cope with marrying into the royal family .
Cobblers .
Even a cursory look at her family tree will make you realise that the media - fuelled idea of Kate Middleton as the daughter of social - climbing parents is absolute rubbish .
Kate 's relatives are very much connected to the good and great of Leeds – to the "" gentry "" if you will .
My research revealed that Kate 's second cousin , thrice removed , is Leeds - born Lady Bullock ( Barbara May Lupton ) , a Cambridge graduate .
And , what 's more that man lying forgotten in Leeds art gallery , Sir Charles Lupton OBE , founded the law firm Dibb Lupton , which later evolved into what is now the world 's largest law firm , DLA Piper ( the L in DLA stands for Lupton ) .
Our reward for all this sleuthing came in the form of kind letters from St James Palace : "" HRH the Duchess of Cambridge would have me thank you very much for highlighting these aspects of her ancestry … "" .
The Royal College of Arms and of course Cambridge itself has been wonderfully welcoming ; both Trinity and Newnham Colleges graciously accepted framed photos ( made by my students ) of Kate 's ancestors and sharing with me Kate - related archival material – a real treat for this Aussie history teacher and his students .
Why is it that fame , if it does occur to us at all , only happens for such a finite period ?
Sir Charles Lupton , was lord mayor of Leeds , and the brother of Kate 's great - great - grandfather Francis .
His wife 's brother was Thomas Ashton , 1st Baron Ashton of Hyde ( also a northerner ) .
But Lupton is pretty much forgotten today .
Such an enormous difference in ' fame - longevity ' compared to King George V , despite both men being deemed important enough to have had their portraits painted around the same time .
But it is good to know that Charles Lupton may be the toast of Leeds again before too long .
He 'll cope with that – just as his great - great - grandniece copes with her every move being dissected by the world 's media .
Oh yes , do n't you worry
, I do n't think Charles will be staying in that basement for much longer .
Northerners do n't wither and die in palaces , nor in storage .
I like to think Kate will read this blog , make a good , fair offer to Leeds art gallery and , as patron of the National Portrait Gallery , quite simply demand that her beloved great - great - great - uncle 's portrait sits alongside that of King George V , both looking fondly down on her and her hubby above their living room fireplace .

Michael Reed has taught humanities for many years in Australia , and was once offered a job as an education curator at an art gallery"
2013-04-16,"As a choice to lead Lady Thatcher 's funeral service the bishop of London â€ “ to use his full title , the Right Reverend and Right Honourable Richard Chartres , KCVO â€ “ appears on the face of it the safest , most establishment - friendly choice possible .
The 65-year - old , who has occupied the number three role in the church since 1995 , is not only close to the Thatcher family but is also a confidant of the royals , a friend of Prince Charles who officiated at Prince William 's confirmation and , later , his wedding to Kate Middleton .
He is a trustee of Princess Diana 's will and a privy councillor , the latter granting him the "" right honourable "" prefix .
But when the white - bearded , intellectually formidable cleric rises to give the address at St Paul 's , his own diocesan cathedral , some will be anticipating his words with a little nervousness .
For all his insider credentials and generally conservative views , Chartres was at the centre of one of the more bitter church - government rows during Thatcher 's prime ministership .
In 1982 , as Robert Runcie 's junior chaplain , Chartres wrote the then archbishop of Canterbury 's sermon for the post - Falklands thanksgiving service .
This enraged Thatcher by calling on the congregation to pray for the dead of both sides and criticising "" those who stay at home , most violent in their attitudes and untouched in themselves "" .
The words were all the more stinging delivered by Runcie , who was awarded the Military Cross as a tank commander in the second world war .
The controversy anticipated Chartres 's own future career .
While largely seen as a conservative he has veered into occasionally unexpected views and actions , a habit allies see as honest and freethinking but viewed by some critics as occasionally opportunistic .
When St Paul 's was fringed by a tented camp of Occupy protesters , Chartres joined a debate with activists about corporate culture and personally delivered a large box of chocolates to them as a Christmas present .
Chartres 's huge confidence , clear talent and seemingly endless high - mindedness â€ “ asked in an interview what he did for frivolity he eventually confessed an interest in the history of farming â€
“ saw him tipped as a future archbishop of Canterbury .
In the end , when Rowan Williams announced his departure from the role , Chartres ruled himself out , reportedly seeing the job as too gruelling at his age .
He would have been a distinctive , even controversial head for the Anglican church .
Opposed to gay marriage , he last year spoke out strongly against what he termed the "" epidemic proportions "" of promiscuity and divorce , saying these made society less happy .
Yet this is the same person who , in 2006 , decided to spend Easter giving lectures on a cruise ship rather than at St Paul 's .
Unrepentant , Chartres told critics this was his first sabbatical in 33 years .
Married with four children , Chartres attended Hertford grammar school and Trinity College , Cambridge , and briefly taught history before his ordination .
In an interview with a vicar , Chartres recounted the faltering start to his church career : "" It was the year of the barricades and I arrived in a bowler hat and voted against all ' modernisations ' .
Some of it was genuine belief , some was immaturity
â€
¦
I took a year or two out working in Sainsbury 's and then in forestry before completing my training .
""
In the same interview Chartres explained that while his mother was from east London , his father was an Irish Huguenot , whose uncle was a Sinn FÃ © in activist and likely gun runner for Michael Collins .
It was this heritage , Chartres said , which decided his university career : "" I asked my father and he said : ' Your grandfather went to Trinity . '
So I applied .
I was in my final year before he told me he had meant Trinity , Dublin . """
2013-04-23,"A close friend of Prince William and Prince Harry is suing News International over alleged phone hacking by the News of the World .
Harry Meade has filed a civil claim against News Group Newspapers , the News International subsidiary that published the now - defunct Sunday tabloid , at the high court in London .
Meade has been close to the princes for over a decade , on occasion appearing in press articles about the antics of Prince Harry .
He hosted the now - infamous fancy dress party in 2005 where Prince Harry wore a swastika armband , prompting an international furore and a swift apology from Clarence House .
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge – known to most as Prince William and Kate Middleton – attended Meade 's wedding in October 2010 in an appearance that prompted speculation , later confirmed , that they were engaged .
Meade is one of eight fresh phone - hacking claims filed against News International in the past month .
Another claiming damages for breach of privacy is Dr Hasnat Khan , the former lover of Princess Diana .
An eminent heart and lung surgeon , Khan had a two - year relationship with the princess that ended months before her death in 1997 .
He told the Mail on Sunday last year after discovering his voicemails may have been intercepted : "" To know that someone has been listening to your private messages is awful .
It is absolutely terrible .
It feels as if you have been robbed .
We live in the UK .
We are supposed to have civil liberties .
I feel really , really violated .
I am very angry .
"" Others to have filed claims against News International in the past four weeks are Susan Katona , the mother of singer Kerry , and former Atomic Kitten performer Jenny Frost .
Others named in court documents are Dionne Lazette Webber , Ronald George Gray and Jonathan M W Sedgwick .
On Friday , the high court heard that eight others – including Matthew Doyle , former deputy director of communications for Tony Blair when he was prime minister , and ex - Blue Peter presenter John Leslie – have accepted undisclosed damages from News International over phone hacking by News of the World .
They are among a total of 149 to have settled civil cases against the newspaper group since the height of the hacking saga in 2011 .
A spokeswoman for News International said : "" We are looking at the details of all these claims . ""

2013-04-24,"The Sun 's royal editor , Duncan Larcombe , has been charged over allegations he paid Â£23,000 to an army sergeant and his wife .
Larcombe is accused of making 34 payments to the sergeant , John Hardy , and his wife , Claire Hardy , between February 2006 and October 2008 for stories about the royal family , the Crown Prosecution Service said on Wednesday .
Hardy was a colour sergeant based at the Royal Military Training Academy in Sandhurst , where Prince Harry and Prince William trained .
At the time of the alleged payments Larcombe was chief royal correspondent .
Larcombe and the Hardys were arrested under Scotland Yard 's Operation Elveden investigation into alleged illicit payments by journalists to public officials .
They have both been charged with conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office , the CPS said , and will appear at Westminster magistrates court on 8 May.
A fourth person , Tracy Bell , a former pharmacy assistant at Sandhurst medical centre , was charged with misconduct in public office over allegations she received Â£1,250 from the Sun between October 2005 and July 2006 for five articles about Sandhurst .
The prosecutors added in a statement : "" These decisions were considered carefully in accordance with the DPP 's guidelines on the public interest in cases affecting the media .
These guidelines require prosecutors to consider whether the public interest served by the conduct in question outweighs the overall criminality before bringing criminal proceedings . ""
May I remind all concerned that these defendants have a right to a fair trial .
It is very important that nothing is said , or reported , which could prejudice that trial .
For these reasons it would be inappropriate for me to comment further .
"" Larcombe 's solicitor , Richard Mallet , said that his client denies any wrongdoing .
Mallett said : "" Mr Larcombe categorically denies any wrongdoing and is entirely confident that the matter will be resolved and he will be exonerated in full .
He is extremely shocked and disappointed that he has been charged with this offence .
Mr Larcombe is renowned within the industry as being an upright and trustworthy individual and fully expects to clear his name .
"" We are unable to comment any further at this stage . ""
Larcombe was made royal editor of the Sun in January 2011 after 14 months as its defence editor .
He was the paper 's royal correspondent between 2005 and 2009 after joining the Sun in October 2002 .

2013-06-14,"John Witherow , the temporary acting editor of The Times , told his staff last week that the loss - making paper had previously relied on profits from other News Corp businesses , adding : "" I fear that era of being subsidised is coming to an end . ""
So I ca n't help wondering whether today 's Times is an indication of what lies ahead - subsidised splash stories .
The paper ran a quirky front page lead that claimed , on the basis of DNA analysis , that Prince William "" will be Britain 's first king to have proven Indian ancestry .
"" It was kind of interesting , the sort of tale that a newspaper diarist would be pleased to run as its top item .
It really did n't exactly cut it as a splash in the paper of record , as many of the reader comments below the online version make clear .
The story - run across three pages plus a leading article - was based on research by a genetics expert at Edinburgh university and a private company called BritainsDNA .
And The Times was clearly so pleased with its royal ancestry scoop that , on page 5 , it carried a special readers ' offer in company with none other than BritainsDNA .
People are urged to order a test on the company 's website or by phone .
And Times+ members were informed that they could enjoy "" a free upgrade package worth Â£65 when they order a DNA test from BritainsDNA . ""
One commenter , Mrs D Kennett , was unimpressed with this novel departure :
"" I find it of some concern that The Times is running such an extensive advertorial to coincide with the launch of the new BritainsDNA test .
"" There were plenty of similar comments .
Ms Elizabeth Keith wrote : "" This merits front - page headlines , does it ?
It 's about time the editors of this so - called quality newspaper got a serious grip on what 's important and what is n't .
And this is n't . ""
Chris Miller , who questioned the genetic "" science "" behind the claims , pointed out : "" Remember BritainsDNA is a commercial operation with a publicity machine .
Their ' genetic testing ' has a lot more in common with palmistry than with real science . ""
And Keith Nicholls simply asked : "" Short of headline news again ? """
2013-06-14,"This morning 's revelation that Prince William has Indian blood on his mother 's side knocked news of Rupert Murdoch 's latest divorce clean off page one of the Times ( though there is an obvious connection ) .
But should we be as surprised in 2013 as we might have pretended to be in imperial 1913 , but would not have been in 1813 ?
After all , it has long been suggested that the Queen herself has African ancestry .
It 's all good globalising stuff .
Two cheers .
Come again ?
Yes .
As recently as the Guardian 's Stuart Jeffries wrote a typically scholarly article discussing claims that Queen Charlotte ( 1744 - 1818 ) , the wife of the uxorious George III was , as a German princess , linked to the 13th - century Portuguese monarch Alfonso III and his mistress , Madragana , who was probably a Moor ( like Othello ) .
Daily Telegraph readers should not reach for their fully - licensed shotguns until they have inspected a few portraits of the late Queen whose 15 children inspired the naming of a famous maternity hospital in her honour .
When one looks at the Queen 's portraits by the great Scottish painter , Allan Ramsay , you can certainly see what people mean .
Back to Prince William .
As soon as I saw the headline I thought : "" Di , what have you been up to ? ""
A compliment , really , to the late princess , though misplaced in this context .
Researchers at Edinburgh University who have been tracing the prince 's line on his mother 's side focused some curiosity on an ancestor seven generations back .
Her name was Eliza Kewark and she was married , according to Edinburgh Uni 's Susan Harvard , in 1812 to a wealthy Scots merchant called Theodore Forbes in the Indian port city of Surat .
Eliza was described at the time as Armenian , but the miraculous DNA link now unearthed â€ “ other descendants ' saliva has been tested , not Wills ' â€ “ all but guarantees that she was at least half South Asian , possibly wholly so .
However evident that was or was n't at the time was ignored as Anglo - Indians such as Cliff Richard or Freddie Mercury could confirm in our own age .
And though Forbes wrote a lot of "" My Dear Betsy "" letters on his travels , the money and allowance he left her in his will in 1818 was to his "" housekeeper "" .
Such euphemisms are not unknown , then or now .
By that stage , Eliza 's children and Theodore 's "" reputed "" children , Kitty and Alexander , had been reluctantly sent "" home "" to Scotland , not least because well - meaning friends were worried that the Indian sun would ruin her complexion .
I bet they did .
Anyway , Kitty later marries into the Crombie coat family and looks a respectable Victorian matron in the sepia photos .
Her great - granddaughter , Ruth , aka Lady Fermoy , was our Scots Queen Mum 's chum , the pair which manoeuvred their respective grandchildren â€ “ Charles and Di â€ “ up the fateful aisle at St Paul 's in 1981 .
It 's a very common story of empire , ours and all the others .
The piquancy of this particular era is well - documented by the writer William Dalrymple , himself a child of Scottish mercantile empire - builders , who has written some brilliant books on the sub - continent .
One , White Mughals , explores the sheer scale of inter - marriage between Indian women and British soldiers , administrators and traders in the decades after the French defeat at Plassey in 1759 and the consolidation of fragmented British control after 1815 when naval power gave it its hegemonic reach .
The dusty stats which Dalrymple has analysed puts the level of inter - marriages as one in three .
Some Brits went native â€ “ as the saying went â€ “ in habit and costume , some converted to Islam , many made handsome financial settlements on their wives and children , some even brought them "" home "" .
The tragedy of the story , a little later than the Forbes marriage , came as more and more wives and would - be wives â€ “ the memsahibs - went out to India .
It was happening at roughly the same time as the Christian revival in post - Georgian England , sometimes known as the second awakening of the Evangelical Movement , moved heavily into the missionary business , taking with it its powerful sense of sin .
A nasty , hopelessly misplaced and transient sense of racial superiority and separation arrived , too .
The Indian Mutiny of 1857 â€ “ the first war of independence to Indians
â€ “ consolidated that trend ; the savagery on both sides underpinning separation with fear .
The Raj lasted a mere 90 years .
How that would have shocked the Victorians in their patronising paternalistic ( and exploitative ) way , but probably no more than the thought of the last Viceroy 's wife , Edwina Mountbatten , having an affair ( carnal or spiritual ? ) with Jawaharlal Nehru , leader of the independence movement .
With her own Indian dalliances , Princess Di might have been amused .
Her brother , Lord Spencer , seems to have clocked the connection : two of his daughters are called Kitty and Eliza .
Which brings us back to the latest Murdoch divorce .
By general consent , Rupert is a tough cookie of Scots empire - building stock .
If this Wall St Journal profile from 2000 is even half true then wife
No 3 , the scourge of the pie - throwing classes , is even tougher
â€ “ Chinese empire - building stock , you might even say .
When the Edinburgh University research team has finished checking out those pushy middle - class Middletons it could do worse than get on the Murdoch / Deng case to see what may lie in store for News Corp â€ “ and the rest of us ."
2013-06-23,"When the 2013 Republic annual conference meets in Leicester this weekend , Queen Elizabeth II will be 87 years old ; five years beyond the average life expectancy of British females .
If she seems much younger , or even ageless ( "" glowing "" , other newspapers would probably call her , paddling in their customary abyss of flattery )
this is surely our fault .
Our inability , or unwillingness , to see her as mortal and fragile â€ “ just another elderly woman , only richer and more photographed than most â€ “ is the central principle , and insanity , of monarchy .
If you consider the needs of constitutional monarchy , Elizabeth has done well .
Perhaps she lacks the imagination , or fury , to be a rotten queen .
I often wonder what her sister Margaret Rose would have done in her place ; screamed like Caligula , I suspect .
Elizabeth has presided over the "" managed decline "" of the British empire with what I imagine is called dignity .
Silence , which is her established personal catchphrase , has an inherent dignity , even if most of the dignity resides in our own projection .
( Jan Morris , a writer whose instincts I trust absolutely , has said that without her advisers Elizabeth does not know what to say to strangers , unless , I suspect , they are of another species ) .
Even so , she has always managed to convey concern for the rest .
When she said , through an intermediary of course , that her greatest regret was not immediately visiting Aberfan after a pit heap collapsed on to its school in 1966 , her regret seemed authentic .
She has managed to convey an impression of thrift and even humility , which I find ridiculous ; but no one thinks Elizabeth II a fleshpot , or selfish , or mad .
When the disaster film 2012 showed a representation of her mounting an ark to escape an exploding world , I laughed , because she would not have gone .
She would not have gone without Philip , and he would not have gone at all , probably because he does n't believe the rubbish intellectuals talk â€
“
you know the rest .
She also , I suspect , benefited from the growing social mobility in the central years of her reign ; gaudy privilege is easier to tolerate in a democracy when spoils are more evenly divided .
( Here , monarchy seems a boastful luxury to taunt other nations , rather than a domestic insult . )
Whether this concern is heartfelt , I do not know , and I do not care .
I have no holy covenant with monarchy .
I do not worship human gods , and I do not want to be clutched in a cold , theoretical embrace in return .
But what next ?
I have always felt that the British attachment to monarchy is an inch deep and a mile wide ; we dream in kings and queens and dreams are by nature insubstantial â€ “ they melt in light .
If it is currently robust ( 69 % said Britain would be worse off without it in 2012 ) that is surely due to Elizabeth 's longevity and skills .
But what of her successors ?
Whether Prince Charles is a good man , again , I do not know or care .
But he does not seem dutiful or grateful , which is the least we can expect for our money and attention .
He seems , in fact , spoilt , childlike and bitter .
His insult to the BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell in 2005 â€ “ ""
I hate these people "" â€ “ was an insult to all who pay the licence fee .
His manic interventions in politics are known , and this is dangerous ; a constitutional monarch must be beyond policy , floating smilingly , like an over - medalled cloud .
His sons , meanwhile , are princes of Tatler : profligate and ignorant , they inhabit a remote Chelsea pond .
Harry is known primarily for inheriting the jocular racism of his grandfather .
He once called a fellow soldier "" our little Paki friend "" ; and what great - grandson of George VI would be so stupid as to wear a Nazi uniform as fancy dress ?
William just seems desperately unhappy , an anxious sacrifice too befuddled by his destiny to grasp its needs or meaning .
We read of Â£4,000-a - night hotel suites ; of Â£250,000 dresses ; of publicly owned helicopters taking detours to amuse the princes and their friends .
Last Saturday the princes attended a wedding ; an RAF Sea King appeared and circled the castle .
( The Ministry of Defence said there was no detour . )
This is not forgivable expenditure .
This is the wages of unthinking entitlement and mindless greed .
Elizabeth II was a child of war ; coddled , yes , but she knew , or pretended that she knew , what world she lived in , that it was different for others â€ “
and she had the responsibility of grace .
Her successors do not share it .

2013-07-10,"As the Duchess of Cambridge 's due date approaches , the royal family looks set to establish a more modern approach to childcare .
With Prince William taking the standard paternity leave of two weeks , speculation is rife that his wife and newborn child will retreat to her parents ' Berkshire home to recover after the birth .
Last week , TV presenter Beverley Turner called upon the duchess to become an advocate for breastfeeding , but it remains uncertain what decision she will make .
Perhaps in common with many new mothers , she is simply waiting to see how it goes .
Royal breastfeeding mothers are a relatively new phenomenon .
The present Queen , Elizabeth II , was breastfed following her birth in 1926 and chose to continue the practice with her own children .
However , in the 1960s , her sister , Princess Margaret , reputedly found it distasteful and made the opposite decision .
Princess Diana insisted on nursing William and Harry herself , but while the Cambridges are expected to follow her more "" hands - on "" approach to parenting , this does not guarantee her grandchild will be fed in the same way .
Historically , most royal mothers did not always believe that breast was best .
In fact , in some cases , it was considered at best an inconvenience , at worst , downright harmful .
In past centuries , the majority of royal babies were handed to a wet nurse soon after their arrival .
Royal women were often little more than symbolic figures , delivering child after child to secure a dynasty .
This was particularly important in times of high infant and child mortality , when the production of second , third and fourth sons were crucial .
Breastfeeding offers a degree of contraceptive protection , so with their babies being fed by others , Queens were free to resume their duties and begin the process of conceiving the next heir .
It was also believed that breast milk would be curdled if marital relations were resumed before weaning .
Often , the royal household would contain a team of lactating women , to ensure the new arrival could be fed on demand .
Women of good birth were considered the most suitable wet nurses , as long as they were of good character and healthy appearance .
We even know the names of some of them : Henry VIII 's short - lived son in 1511 was suckled by an Elizabeth Poyntz and the future Richard the Lionheart was nursed by a woman named Hodierna .
Boys traditionally spent longer at the breast than their sisters , often up to two years , as they were considered to be more dependent and fussy as babies .
When convenient , aristocratic women from the royal household were chosen for the job .
In 1566 , the future James I was suckled by Lady Reres , his mother 's lady - in - waiting , while the youngest daughter of Charles
I was fed by the trusted Lady Dalkeith in 1644 .
The choice was an important one .
It was believed that babies could absorb a wet nurse 's temperament through her milk , as well as being affected by her diet , so strong alcohol , garlic and spices were rejected in favour of bland food .
Wet nurses would use herbal and folkloric remedies to ensure their continuing milk flow , such as wearing a steel chain between their breasts or reciting charms .
During the 18th century , doctors were suspicious of the value of breast milk and advised mothers to avoid using it where possible .
The first milk , or colostrum , was judged to be harmful , and it was thought that feeding should not take place at all until post - partum bleeding was over .
Newborns were fed with animal milk , or honey and sugar water for around a month .
Some were suckled on linen pouches , horns , clay jugs and pickled cow nipples , which must have been riddled with germs .
Gruel and oatmeal were also used as weaning foods , which often resulted in fatal cases of diarrhoea .
Queen Mary of Modena was told by her doctors that her ailing baby , James Stuart , would not last half an hour if breastfed .
In the end , a local tile - maker 's wife was brought to feed the baby in such haste that she was wearing old shoes and no stockings .
Her milk probably saved the baby 's life .
Queen Victoria found the idea of breastfeeding repellent , considering it the "" ruin "" of intellectual and refined young ladies .
Her own daughters concealed from her their choice to suckle their babies themselves , leading her to brand them "" cows "" on discovering the secret .
Surprisingly , considering modern perceptions of her as a Victorian domestic goddess , Mrs Beeton echoed this sentiment .
She compared babies to vampires and advocated the use of the newly available powdered milks , administered in a glass jar , to prevent maternal fatigue .
Now that royal mothers are no longer tied to an endless regime of producing heirs , the duchess 's decision whether or not to breastfeed will be an entirely personal one .
In the privacy of her parental home , she will have time to adapt and make her decisions without being overlooked by the traditional throng of courtiers , lords and ministers .
Today 's doctors may advise that breast is best but the numbers of new mothers choosing to feed their babies themselves is falling .
The eyes of the world may be turned her way this July , but as a modern mum , the Duchess is more likely to consult her family and friends before following tradition and duty .

2013-07-22,"For the first and probably only time in his life , the royal baby behaved in an impeccably normal , if not to say ordinary , fashion at birth .
The heir to the throne weighed an extremely healthy 8lbs 6 oz , about a pound heavier than the UK average , but given that the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William are both of above average height ( she is 1.78 m or 5 ft 8ins tall and the English average is 5 ft 3ins according to the Office for National Statistics ) and that she will have eaten very well and received the very best of care throughout her pregnancy , the young prince is not a heavyweight .
The normal range in the UK is around 5lbs 8 oz to 9lbs 14 oz .
The duchess was in labour from the early hours until she gave birth at 4.24pm – normal progress .
Average labour for a first baby is about eight hours .
Subsequent children usually arrive faster .
The palace was frugal with details of the birth , but it would be surprising if the baby had been induced , unless it was well after the due date .
Most first babies are late and some are early – only about 5 % arrive when the midwife predicts they will .
The heat and the pressure might have persuaded some women in the Duchess ' position to ask for labour to be induced , but if she did stick it out and go into labour naturally , she is less likely to have had medical intervention at the end .
Studies have shown that induced labour more often leads to epidurals , forceps deliveries , caesareans and other interventions ."
2013-07-23,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were spending their first full day with their newborn son on Tuesday , amid anticipation the world would get its first glimpse of the baby destined to be a king .
Prince William stayed overnight with mother and baby at the Lindo wing at St Mary 's hospital , Paddington , west London , where , at 4.24pm on Monday the duchess was safely delivered of her son , weighing 8lbs 6 oz ( 3.8 kg ) .
In a brief statement issued on Monday night , the duke said : "" We could not be happier . ""
A Kensington Palace spokesman said it was "" too early "" to say if the family would be leaving St Mary 's Lindo wing on Tuesday : "" In terms of whether they will be discharged , it 's down to their medical team and themselves when they 'll be discharged , but it 's too early to say .
"" It is not known whether the couple will receive visitors .
While Kate 's parents , Carole and Michael Middleton , and siblings Pippa and James may pop in , new grandfather the Prince of Wales was continuing his two - day visit to Yorkshire .
He issued a brief statement on Monday night , saying : "" Both my wife and I are overjoyed at the arrival of my first grandchild .
It is an incredibly special moment for William and Catherine and we are so thrilled for them on the birth of their baby boy .
"" Grandparenthood is a unique moment in anyone 's life , as countless kind people have told me in recent months , so I am enormously proud and happy to be a grandfather for the first time and we are eagerly looking forward to seeing the baby in the near future .
"" It is thought unlikely that the Queen will visit â€ “ though she did on the occasion of William 's birth .
But she will undoubtedly be able to see her third great - grandchild in private before departing for Balmoral for her summer sojourn on Friday .
No name has yet been announced for the third - in - line to the throne , though the bookies ' favourites were George and James .
The couple have drawn up a shortlist but , given their son 's destiny , will be consulting with members of the royal family .
It took one week for William 's name to be made public , and a month for Charles 's .
There were celebrations around the world .
In London , gun salutes will sound across the capital to mark the birth of the baby , a tradition carried out upon the arrival of every new prince or princess .
The King 's Troop Royal Horse Artillery will ride past Buckingham Palace to stage a 41-gun royal salute in Green park at 2 pm .
At the Tower of London , there will be a 62-gun salute from the Gun Wharf by the Honourable Artillery Company .
A royal gun salute normally comprises 21 rounds , increased to 41 if fired from a royal park or residence .
The Tower gets an extra 21 for the citizens of the City of London to show their loyalty to the monarch .
Outside Buckingham Palace the ornate easel , upon which the foolscap bulletin announcing details of the birth to the world was placed last night , remained in place .
New Zealand got in early with its 21-gun salute , due to the time difference , staging it outside parliament in Wellington .
The country also planned to illuminate 37 landmarks nationwide .
Back in London , Trafalgar Square 's fountains were lit with blue lights , and will remain lit for the next six days , as will London 's Living Room at the top of City Hall .
The London mayor , Boris Johnson , said : "" Huge congratulations to the duke and duchess on the birth of their first child who will , by virtue of being born in this great city , be a Londoner through and through . ""
The fountains in Marble Arch and the Golden Jubilee bridge were also lit up in blue and will remain so until midnight .
The leader of Westminster city council , Philippa Rose , said : "" We will be working with Kensington Palace to register the birth of the baby . ""
Even Niagara Falls in Canada was illuminated in blue , as was the Peace tower and parliament buildings in Ottawa , and the CN tower in Toronto .
On board HMS Kent , crew lined up to spell out the word "" BOY "" on deck .
Messages of congratulation continued to flood in from across Britain and the world .
President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle were among the first to congratulate the couple on "" the joyous occasion "" , with the president referring to the "" special relationship "" between the US and Britain making Americans "" pleased to join with the people of the United Kingdom as they celebrate the birth of the young prince "" .
Canada 's prime minister , Stephen Harper , sent his "" heartfelt congratulations "" .
As things stand , the baby prince is destined to be king not just of Britain , but 15 other Commonwealth realms including Canada and Australia .
Kevin Rudd , the prime minister of Australia , announced the country 's gift to the baby prince would be a research project examining a desert - dwelling Australian marsupial , the bilby . ""
In terms of cute and cuddly toys , it 'll be a cute and cuddly bilby , "" he said .
Prince William had a fondness for Australian marsupials as a small child , and was nicknamed "" wombat "" at home .
In a statement , Rudd said the country shared the joy of the royal family : "" Prince William holds a special place in the hearts of many Australians .
Some of us remember his first visit to this country as a nine - month - old baby more than 30 years ago with his mother Diana and father Charles . ""
New Zealand , meanwhile , is sending a gift of a hand - woven , fine lace shawl , which took more than 280 hours to weave .
The birth of a boy means the history books will not be totally rewritten .
Had the baby been a girl , the newly passed Succession to the Crown Act 2013 would have seen her become monarch , even if a younger brother was born .
But the act does mean that the new prince , should he chose , could marry a Catholic without renouncing his right to the throne , though he can not be one himself .
Station commander Group Captain Adrian Hill , on behalf of all at RAF Valley , where William serves as a search and rescue pilot , said : "" We are delighted to learn that Flight Lieutenant Wales and the Duchess of Cambridge are now proud parents of a newborn son . ""
The Irish Guards , of which William is colonel , raised a traditional glass of stout at their barracks in Aldershot and bases in London to wet the baby 's head .
The Royal Mint has unveiled a commemorative silver penny to mark the occasion .
It will produce 2,013 , which are available to babies born on the same day as the prince .
The campaign group Republic , which launched its # bornEqual initiative earlier this month , calling for every child to be born equal in political status and rights , said the royal birth raised serious questions about Britain and democratic values .
But its chief executive , Graham Smith , said the baby should be allowed to grow up without "" constant interference and intrusion "" .
He added : "" Here is a new baby whose career , religion , even personal relationships have already been mapped out .
Thanks to the monarchy , he will have very few real choices in life â€ “
so let 's give him the space to grow up as normally as possible ,
Meanwhile , this is an opportunity for the rest of us to consider whether this circus is the best way to run things . """
2013-07-23,"Who has best learned the lessons of the 1980s , when Prince William was a baby and his mother was subject to an unrelenting media - feeding frenzy â€ “ the press or the palace ?
The straightforward answer is that the palace long ago took that experience on board and has handled its PR with greater professionalism ever since .
Even when it wobbled in the aftermath of the death of Diana , Princess of Wales , in 1997 , it managed to turn matters around within a week .
The popular press , resistant to any restraint , may lay claim to having learned from its past misbehaviour , but a leopard would change its spots before tabloid editors mended their ways .
Editorial ambitions are largely irrelevant , however , because it is the change of the royal cast , and the differences in their characters , that count more .
The Duchess of Cambridge has not made the mistakes of her late mother - in - law .
Discretion has been her watchword .
In the years since she and her husband met at university , the couple has avoided the media elephant traps set for them .
They will surely do so again now that they have become parents .
They will protect their baby just as they have done so successfully for themselves over the past couple of years .
To keep media attention to a minimum , they have used all the security advantages provided by the palace and , on the rare occasions of intrusions into their privacy , have been swift to act .
The duchess has sought help from the Press Complaints Commission ( PCC ) to deal with prying photographers and , when she was snapped topless while sunbathing in a French villa , the palace called in the lawyers .
They have kept journalists at arm 's length by merely fulfilling the minimum of official press conferences and photocalls .
Neither she nor her husband have stooped to briefing the press and give no hint of doing so in future .
Their reticence appears to be part of their personalities , but their deft handling of the media is certainly a legacy of Prince William 's memories of what happened to his mother .
Diana was the object of intense press and public fascination from the moment her relationship with Prince Charles emerged .
Though she kept her distance from reporters and photographers during their engagement and the early stages of their marriage , the newspapers soon found that she was as much a Princess of Sales as a Princess of Wales .
So a royal ratpack , partly monarchist and adulatory , wholly commercial and cynical , exploited every opportunity to obtain circulation - winning material about Diana .
It began when she was pregnant with William .
She was pictured in a bikini on a beach on an obscure Caribbean island .
The Press Council â€ “ forerunner of the PCC â€ “ censured the two papers responsible for publishing the pictures , The Sun and Daily Star , but the die was cast .
Princess Diana became public property .
And her sons ' early lives were blighted by intrusion too .
The Sunday People went so far as to publish a picture of William answering a call of nature under the headline "" The royal wee "" .
As the Wales 's marriage disintegrated , it was transformed into a royal soap opera recorded in daily updates in papers and magazines .
The paparazzi tormented Diana by following her every move , but she went on to compound the problem by indulging in covert briefings of favoured journalists .
William and his brother , Harry , were able to enjoy a measure of privacy because the palace secured agreements with the press , largely brokered by the then PCC director , Guy Black ( now Lord Black , a Telegraph group executive and chairman of the Press Standards Board of Finance that oversees the PCC ) .
Even so , as a schoolboy William could not be other than aware that the press was always looking for ways to evade the agreement .
Meanwhile , he must have noted the negative effects of a compromised private life on his mother 's status .
One key difference between the media of his youth and that of today is the obsessive use of social media .
Everyone is a journalist now in the sense that people can observe , snap photographs and then publish them in the blink of an eye .
But people need to get close up to take pictures with smartphones , and aside from formal engagements , the couple do not appear in public .
So there is no opportunity for candid shots .
Thus far , the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have not been troubled by the rise of the new media landscape .
Though pictures of the duchess attending official visits have appeared on Twitter , nothing remotely intrusive has been posted .
It is impossible to predict with any certainty that the latest addition to the Windsors will enjoy a life entirely free from intrusion , but the signs surely point in that direction .
This new prince is bound to start off with a relatively quiet infancy ."
2013-07-23,"Royal babies used to be born in palaces ; these days many mothers prefer hospitals .
The Queen gave birth to Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace but her daughter , Princess Anne , started the trend towards St Mary 's Paddington when she chose the hospital to have her children , Peter and Zara Phillips .
Diana followed for the birth of Prince William in 1982 , then Prince Harry in 1984 .
Curiously , Queen Victoria was born in May 1819 in Kensington Palace on a floor above the Cambridges ' new home and christened there as Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent .
Royal births in those days were often protracted , painful and far from private .
It was common practice for witnesses to attend a birth , to encourage the woman in labour and to swear there had been no foul play if the child died .
At a birth of a potential heir to the throne , witnesses were considered essential and the room would be crowded with ladies - in - waiting , midwives , servants and doctors , with the male courtiers hovering in the background .
There were fears that unscrupulous monarchs would replace a dead baby with another newborn male , carried to the birth bed concealed in a warming pan .
After the Reformation , Protestants were afraid that the Catholic Stuarts would cheat to divert the succession away from the Protestant Hanoverians .
Ministers and privy counsellors had been present with the ladies - in - waiting until 1894 , when Queen Victoria decided that for the birth of the future Edward VIII , the home secretary would be enough .
Princess Margaret kept the home secretary waiting for her birth at her grandparents ' Scottish castle , Glamis , in August 1930 .
Home secretaries attended until the birth of Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace in 1948 when it was announced that the practice would be discontinued .
Until recently the first born would not inherit the throne unless he was a boy . ""
Oh , madam , it is a princess , "" Queen Victoria 's disappointed doctor , Charles Locock , told her when her first baby , Princess Victoria was born at Buckingham Palace .
""
Never mind , "" the young Queen replied , "" the next will be a prince .
"" It was : the future Edward VII .
For the birth of her first child , Victoria had a 12-hour labour and by her own account "" suffered severely "" .
Prince Albert was at her bedside almost throughout .
Victoria enjoyed sex but hated pregnancy , which she called the "" shadow - side "" of marriage .
There were no anaesthetics until Dr John Snow administered ether ( ie chloroform ) to Victoria during the births of Prince Leopold and Princess Beatrice , writing his groundbreaking book On Chloroform and Other Anaesthetics in 1858 .
Queen Victoria herself called it "" that blessed chloroform "" and its effect "" soothing , quieting and delightful beyond measure "" .
One particularly gruesome experience was that of George IV 's only child , Princess Charlotte , whose excruciating death in childbirth in 1817 led to Victoria 's eventual accession to the throne .
Only 21 and madly in love with her husband , Leopold , poor Charlotte endured 50 hours of labour before giving birth to a stillborn son .
Within 24 hours , she too was dead after painful haemorrhaging caused by the doctors ' bungling ( the man chiefly responsible later killed himself as a result ) .
Although Charlotte had lived secluded from the public gaze at Claremont outside London , in the months before her confinement she had been the subject of intense press speculation and huge bets on the sex of her unborn baby were laid at the Stock Exchange .
It was the same , only much more so , for the 20th - century "" People 's Princess "" Diana , who was photographed five months pregnant with Prince William in a bikini on a beach in the Bahamas .
The media expert Roy Greenslade called the bikini photographs the great turning point in her relationship with the press : "" editors and reporters were in love with Diana …
no one could get enough of her "" .
Diana went into St Mary 's Paddington for the birth of Prince William , which was induced , she told the biographer Andrew Morton , "" because I could n't handle the press pressure any longer , it was becoming unbearable .
It was as if everybody was monitoring every day for me . ""
When her officials told her that they would come to the hospital to keep the people informed , she had what they called a "" foot stamp "" .
"" What 's that got to do with you ? "" she asked furiously .
Prince Charles , who attended the birth , told his godmother Patricia Brabourne that he had never seen such scenes as there were outside the hospital when he left that night , "" everyone had gone berserk with excitement "" .
There is similar excitement about the birth of William and Kate 's first child , the future heir to the throne , but this time round there is a difference .
Kate 's family are more involved and closer to the couple than the Spencers were to Diana .
Carole Middleton is level - headed , practical and energetic and likely to be a hands - on grandmother .
The Queen heard the news via a telephone call from Prince William .
For the general public and the world at large tradition was followed : the news bulletin on the time and the date of the baby 's birth ( and its sex ) was posted outside Buckingham Palace just as William 's was and it seems likely that the couple and their child will be going back to their new home in Kensington Palace , as Diana did .
It seems likely too that in the near future the new family will want to join the Middletons in their Berkshire country house .
What is certain , however , is that the child will succeed William on the throne and that among his ancestors will be a coal miner , Joseph Harrison , who once worked in the Queen Mother 's County Durham coal mine .
Incidentally , the Queen Mother 's own place of birth on 4 August 1900 remains uncertain – one of the few remaining royal mysteries of the 20th century .
She was airily vague about it and even her authorised biographer , William Shawcross , seemed unsure in his book published in 2009 , as did Hugo Vickers in his earlier biography .
Was it London or was it St Paul 's Walden Bury , her family 's country home in Hertfordshire ?
We will never know , as the saying goes .
Over a century later , under the relentless scrutiny of the media worldwide , the same will not be true of her great - great - grandchild .
Sarah Bradford is one of the foremost authorities on the British royal family , as well as the author of biographies including Elizabeth :
A Biography of Her Majesty the Queen ; America 's Queen : The Life of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis ; and Diana .
She is working on a life of Queen Victoria ."
2013-07-23,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were spending their first full day with their newborn son on Tuesday , amid anticipation the world would get its first glimpse of the baby destined to be a king .
It is expected that the duchess and her baby will remain in the private Lindo wing of St Mary 's hospital , Paddington , for most of Tuesday , and may even stay an extra night .
Her husband , Prince William , stayed overnight with them at the luxury suite where , at 4.24pm on Monday , she gave birth to a boy weighing 8lbs 6 oz ( 3.8 kg ) .
In a statement on Tuesday morning , the couple said : "" We would like to thank the staff at the Lindo wing and the whole hospital for the tremendous care the three of us have received .
"" We know it has been a very busy period for the hospital and we would like to thank everyone â€ “ staff , patients and visitors â€ “ for their understanding during this time . ""
The duke had previously said of their new baby , who is third in line to the throne : "" We could not be happier . ""
A Kensington Palace spokesman said : "" Mother , son and father are all doing well this morning . ""
The duchess is not expected to leave the hospital before 6 pm on Tuesday at the earliest .
The couple have not released any information about the name of their child .
It is not known whether the couple will receive visitors .
While her parents , Carole and Michael Middleton , and siblings Pippa and James may pop in , the other new grandfather the Prince of Wales was continuing his two - day visit to Yorkshire .
Prince Charles , on a visit to Bugthorpe , a village in east Yorkshire , said he had wet his grandson 's head with champagne . ""
But just a little bit , "" he told wellwisher Alec Dale .
Charles 's wife , the Duchess of Cornwall , meanwhile , said the birth was "" wonderful news "" and "" a wonderfully uplifting moment for the country "" .
"" It 's very exciting and it 's wonderful for the grandfather â€ “
he 's brilliant with children , "" she told the BBC .
The celebratory mood was continuing at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday morning at the changing of the guard , where the band of the Scots Guard struck up Congratulations , Royal Salute , The Duke of Cambridge March and Procession of the Nobles .
Campanology fans , meanwhile , were to be treated to three hours of pealing at Westminster Abbey from 2 pm , as 10 bell ringers perform the Cambridge Surprise Royal , consisting of some 5,000 changes , and composed for the royal couple 's wedding .
In London , gun salutes will sound across the capital to mark the birth of the baby , a tradition carried out upon the arrival of every new prince or princess .
The King 's Troop Royal Horse Artillery will ride past Buckingham Palace to stage a 41-gun royal salute in Green Park at 2 pm .
At the Tower of London , there will be a 62-gun salute from the Gun Wharf by the Honourable Artillery Company .
A royal gun salute normally comprises 21 rounds , increased to 41 if fired from a royal park or residence .
The Tower gets an extra 21 for the citizens of the City of London to show their loyalty to the monarch .
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have 42 days from Monday to register the birth .
Normally registration of births at the Paddington hospital happen at Marylebone town hall , but traditionally royals are registered at home by a registrar .
The crowd outside the Lindo wing grew steadily through the early morning on Tuesday , every eye and camera trained on the tall grey stone doorway .
The delivery of an extra lorry load of security barriers just before 10 am was taken as an omen that something might happen .
The photographers assured one another of what might happen next , based on unimpeachable sources : other photographers .
"" They 're coming out in an hour . ""
"" They 're coming out this afternoon .
"" "" They 're not coming out till tomorrow . ""
"" We 'll get an hour 's warning . ""
"" They 'll go out the back â€ “ we 'll get nothing . """
2013-07-24,"With the multitude of cameras focused on the front door of the Lindo Wing , it is hard to imagine the baby , the future king , who will soon emerge from it will have any hope of privacy .
Once the furore over his birth has died down , his parents will be keen to keep their child out of the limelight .
However , with the Press Complaints Commission facing imminent demise , the machinery that has done much to secure privacy for Prince William in his childhood , and then Kate in turn when their engagement was announced , is about to be dismantled .
The PCC 's replacement , whether it is the Independent Press Standards Organisation or the politicians ' royal charter alternative , will have to negotiate the tricky question of press access to the heir to the throne .
This might be more difficult than it seems .
While the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been very visible on their own terms at pre - arranged press media appearances , they , or those looking after their PR , have been less accommodating when caught unawares .
When national newspapers were offered pictures of the royal couple walking on a public beach in Anglesey , they inquired of the royal press machine whether their use would be OK .
No , came the very firm reply , it was a "" private walk on a public beach "" – a novel concept in UK privacy law and one yet to be given the seal of approval by any court .
Nevertheless the pictures went unused .
Of course , the royal couple have more reason than most to realise how easy it is for their privacy to be invaded after a photographer snatched topless photographs of the duchess holidaying at a private villa in France last year .
While the PCC insists that it treats the royal family no differently from other individuals when it comes to the protection offered by the editors ' code of practice , it has issued advisory notices to newspapers in the past to warn of harassment of Kate Middleton before she married Prince William .
Such advisories have been issued in relation to other people , not just royalty , of course .
When Prince William celebrated his 18th birthday and left school , the PCC 's then chairman , Lord Wakeham , made a speech in which he said the fact that the prince had been able to go through his school life free from press intrusion was a triumph of self - regulation by the industry .
He made the point that the restraint was rewarded by regular access to the royal princes by way of press facilities .
It may well be that the new Prince of Cambridge needs a similar level of protection for his childhood .
The question now is whether Ipso is up to the task .
It looks likely that Ipso will at least start with the PCC editors ' code , which Lord Wakeham pointed out in 2000 would continue to protect Prince William as it did everyone else .
The speech was made before , of course , the interception of the voicemail messages of one of William 's aides led to the discovery of widespread phone hacking and ultimately the Leveson inquiry .
Therefore the privacy of the new prince will depend on a new regulator , perhaps Ipso , that is the result of a chain of events set in train by the hacking of a phone belonging to a member of the royal household , and whether it can impose a code that prevents the abuses of the past , not just of royalty , but ordinary people too .
How it protects the prince , and others seeking privacy in an age of new media , will be the regulator 's first real test .

2013-07-24,"A future king has attended his first photocall aged one day old as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge presented their newborn son to the world .
The infant prince made his debut on the steps of the Lindo wing at St Mary 's hospital , Paddington , a little over 24 hours after his birth , as the duchess was discharged at 7.15pm .
Cradling the third in line to the throne on the same spot where he himself was introduced to the public 31 years ago , Prince William said they were "" still working on a name "" .
The couple posed for pictures before massed ranks of photographers with hundreds of lenses trained on the tiny yawning bundle to capture the historic moment , with the duchess holding their son before passing him to her husband . ""
He 's got a good pair of lungs on him ,
that 's for sure , "" said William .
"" He 's a big boy , he 's quite heavy .
We are still working on a name
so we will have that as soon as we can .
"" What about George , someone asked . ""
Wait and see , "" the duke replied .
He added : "" It 's the first time we have seen him really
so we are having a proper chance to catch up . ""
Kate , who chose a bespoke cornflower blue crepe de chine Jenny Packham dress for the occasion , said : "" It 's very emotional .
It 's such a special time .
I think any parent will know what this feeling feels like . ""
Her husband agreed : "" It 's very special . ""
Joking about the long wait for the media , the duke said : "" I will remind him of his tardiness when he 's a bit older because I know how long you guys have been standing out here .
So hopefully the hospital and you guys can all get back to normal now and we can go and look after him . ""
The two disagreed over whom he most resembled : "" He 's got her looks , thankfully , "" said William .
But Kate demurred : "" No , I am not sure about that . ""
And yes .
He had changed his first nappy . ""
Done that , "" he said , triumphantly .
"" Yes , he was very good , "" said Kate .
Asked about the baby 's hair , William said : "" He 's got way more than me , thank God . ""
The couple then drove off to Kensington Palace , with William at the wheel after he had successfully secured the child car seat into which his tiny son was securely strapped , a feat he executed with skill and a relieved mop of his brow once accomplished .
The as - yet - unnamed baby prince was born at 4.24pm on Monday weighing 8lbs 6 oz after the duchess was admitted in the early stages of labour shortly before 6 am that day .
He met his grandparents for the first time on Tuesday as celebrations for the royal birth were staged across the capital and around the Commonwealth for the infant .
The Duchess of Cambridge 's parents , Carole and Michael Middleton , travelling in a black cab , were first to visit the hospital where the royal couple had spent their first day as parents .
The beaming Middletons emerged after one hour , Carole telling TV cameras the baby was "" absolutely beautiful â€ ¦
They are both doing really well , and we are so thrilled .
"" Asked what the first cuddle with her grandson was like , she said : ""
Amazing .
It 's all coming back . ""
Had she suggested any names ? ""
Absolutely not . ""
The Prince of Wales , returning from a two - day official visit to Yorkshire , was next to roll up , in a chauffeur - driven limousine , leaving after 30 minutes and describing his grandson as "" marvellous , thank you very much , absolutely marvellous â€ “
you wait and see , you 'll see in a minute "" .
Earlier , the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had issued a statement saying : "" We would like to thank the staff at the Lindo wing and the whole hospital for the tremendous care the three of us have received .
We know it has been a very busy period for the hospital and we would like to thank everyone â€ “ staff , patients and visitors â€ “ for their understanding during this time . ""
The bookies ' favourites for the name are George and James .
The couple have drawn up a shortlist but , given their son 's destiny , will be consulting members of the royal family .
It took one week for William 's name to be made public , and a month for Charles 's .
Crowds gathered throughout the day at Buckingham Palace , where the queue to photograph the official birth bulletin mounted on an easel in the forecourt was still half an hour long on Tuesday evening .
As is traditional , the birth announcement also appeared in the Court Circular , the published diary of royal engagements which was started by George III in 1803 .
It read : "" KENSINGTON PALACE 22nd July , 2013 .
The Duchess of Cambridge was safely delivered of a son at 4.24 p.m. today .

In keeping with the festivities , the Changing of the Guard saw the Band of the Scots Guard strike up Congratulations , and , appropriately , The Duke of Cambridge March .
Though a couple of miles from the Lindo wing , it is a sound the baby royal will become extremely accustomed to throughout his royal life .
Elsewhere the capital was a riot of colour and sound .
Central London shuddered as a 41-gun royal salute by the King 's Troop Royal Horse Artillery pounded Green Park and a 62-gun salute by the Honourable Artillery Company was fired from Gun Wharf at the Tower of London .
The bells of Westminster Abbey pealed for a solid three hours .
Trafalgar Square 's fountains , those at Marble Arch , the Golden Jubilee bridge , and several other landmarks were illuminated by bright blue lights to mark the birth of the future king .
Niagara Falls in Canada took on the same spectacular blue hue , as did the parliament buildings in Ottawa and the CN tower in Toronto .
In New Zealand , which because of the time difference had the honour of staging the first 21-gun salute outside its Wellington parliament , 37 landmark buildings were lit blue in celebration .
In Westminster , the leader of the house of Lords , Lord Hill of Oareford , moved a humble address on behalf of parliament . ""
May it please your royal highnesses to accept the loyal congratulations of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in parliament assembled on the birth of a son to Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge ; and to assure Your Royal Highnesses of our great satisfaction and pleasure at this news .

Messages of congratulation continued to flood in from across the globe for the boy who , as things stand , is destined to be king not just of Britain , but of 15 other Commonwealth realms .
Australia 's prime minister , Kevin Rudd , announced the country 's gift to the newborn would be a toy bilby , a desert - dwelling Australian marsupial , and a research project dedicated to its survival .
New Zealand was sending a fine lace shawl which took more than 280 hours to weave by hand .
In India the dabbawalas of Mumbai were celebrating the birth with the Indian tradition of passing out sweets .
The Russian president , Vladimir Putin , "" extended his felicitations "" to the Queen , the newborn and the couple .
Even in Iran , where diplomatic relations have been suspended since the British embassy in Tehran was ransacked by a mob in November 2011 , there was a measured statement from the foreign ministry spokesman , Abbas Araghchi .
Quoted on the semi - official ISNA news agency it said : "" I congratulate the esteemed Queen and the heir to the throne .
Apparently this baby is the third in line to the throne . ""
It added : "" Obviously the relations between UK and Iran are too complex to be affected by the birth of a baby . """

To hit what George Osborne originally promised his austerity would achieve , GDP has to rise by an impossible 5.3 % in each of the next two years .
Whose growth is it anyway ?
The great majority will see no improvement in living standards , with wages still falling behind inflation , year after year .
And what kind of growth ?
Instead of his promised rebalancing , the bartender in the Treasury brings the down - and - out alcoholic a bottle of the rot - gut feelgood that put us all in the gutter in the first place .
No productivity , no manufacturing , no exports , no investment but instead cheap money , zombie banks primed with quantitative easing who still wo n't lend , unsustainably low interest rates
â€ “ and now Help to Buy to pump up house prices .
Homeowners may feel better by the election , able to remortgage and spend again â€ “ and what else matters ?
But we are back on the bottle big - time .
Savings are falling , investment is down by a quarter since the crash and 158 countries invest more than Britain .
Foreign investment into Britain has been good â€ “ but that 's put at risk by Conservative euro - madness : as the Engineering Employers Federation said , it relies on access to EU markets .
So is this the time to spend Â£12bn on urging people to buy with a 5 % deposit , not even restricted to first - time buyers , on properties up to Â£600,000 ?
True , neither prices nor quantity of sales have reached pre - crash levels â€ “ but that 's a dangerous benchmark .
It 's rare to see such a phalanx of loyal Tory - supporters , such as the Institute of Directors , throwing their hands in the air in horror as happened after Osborne 's Help to Buy launch on Tuesday .
By 2017 the scheme is supposed to end â€ “ but as with the Lawson - induced house - price bubble , how do you take the bottle away without another collapse , his critics asked ?
Although home owning is falling , down to 64 % of the population in 2011 , property prices remain our national addiction :
just count the number of stories a week gleefully predicting rises .
Osborne is betting that homeowners will bring home the electoral bacon .
But people now know apparent growth based on cheap money and artificial mortgages is fool 's gold .
Here is Labour 's chance to be the wiser party , ready to sober up the nation .
House prices are highly sensitive to government words and actions .
Labour should say loudly and firmly that it will do everything in its power to freeze prices .
Language and firm intent can chill expectations .
Lay out a policy whose stated aim is to house people well and restore homes as a commodity like any other , not a one - way bet to wealth .
Plan to build at least a million homes , instruct and enable local authorities and housing associations to build and force developers to use their hoarded land or sell it on .
Freeze rents
so they rise by no more than annual inflation to stop property being used as investment , redirecting that money productively .
Warn that if prices still rise , from now on capital gains tax may be imposed on homes to chill the market .
Do whatever it takes , and say so loudly .
Labour will borrow to invest outside the current spending straitjacket it has accepted for year one , that investment sum to be announced nearer the election .
Why not describe that as the national mortgage , the nation borrowing to build massively to invest in the future generation , just as households do ?
A national mortgage to build would contrast well with Help to Buy inflating existing stock into new bubble prices ."
2013-07-26,"A photographer suspected of taking topless photographs of the Duchess of Cambridge while she was on holiday in the south of France has been placed under formal investigation , according to AFP .
The unnamed photographer is the latest of several media figures to be investigated for invasion of privacy in France after pictures were published in September last year of Prince William and his wife sunbathing on a balcony in a private property in the south of France .
The editor of the French magazine Closer , Laurence Pieau , had already been placed under formal investigation earlier this month , Agence France Presse reported .
In April , the head of the publisher of the French edition of Closer magazine , named as Ernesto Mauri , and another photographer suspected of taking pictures of the holidaying royal couple were put under investigation , the last step in France before being charged .
The topless photos emerged last September , and most British outlets refused to publish them in the wake of the Leveson report .
French Closer did publish them and St James 's Palace launched legal proceedings against the magazine , one of the first instances of a case like this involving the royal family in modern times .
The complaint from St James 's Palace sparked a criminal investigation in France .
The Duke and Duchess launched criminal proceedings against the photographer under France 's strict privacy laws .
A French court granted them an injunction in September preventing Closer from publishing further shots of Kate sunbathing topless .
The pictures were apparently taken on the terrace of a guest house during a brief holiday in France last year .

2013-08-01,"It might not go down as one of the great television howlers , but the BBC has apologised for broadcasting a picture of the Duke of Cambridge with a penis drawn on his head .
The less - than - princely blunder happened on BBC Breakfast on Thursday morning when the BBC1 show broadcast a clip of a promo video for the comedy quartet Barbershopera .
The phallic graffiti was only on screen for a matter of seconds but was spotted by several eagle - eyed viewers
â€ “ even though it had apparently been missed by BBC editors .
"" Wow bbc breakfast just showed a picture of prince William with a penis drawn on his head , "" tweeted Andreas Vesalius .
Dave Yates remarked : "" Dear BBC Breakfast .
The trail for ' Barbershopera ' just showed a cartoon drawing of a penis on Prince William 's head .
Please be more careful . ""
The BBC was quick to apologise for the "" offending material "" , which it said had been provided by Barbershopera .
A BBC spokeswoman said : "" This image was shown fleetingly within a comedy promotional video for Barbershopera , a humorous barbershop group , who were appearing later on in the programme . ""
The material was provided by Barbershopera but we failed to spot the offending material within it .
We apologise for this . ""
Viewers hoping to re - live the unfortunate blunder will be disappointed to learn the programme will not be available on the BBC iPlayer , as BBC Breakfast is never uploaded to the catch - up service .

2013-08-15,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their new baby Prince George may be visiting Australia next year , Prince William has said .
Greeting well - wishers at the Anglesey show in Wales , William told an Australian couple of his tentative plans to come down under in 2014 .
"" We are all very hopeful of coming to Australia next year , "" he told Max and Maxine Davies , who are from Victor Harbour , near Adelaide .
The couple , aged 77 and 75 respectively , later told British reporters they were thrilled at the prospect of a royal tour . ""
How wonderful that the family will come to Australia to visit , "" Mrs Davies said .
William last visited Australia in January 2010 , a couple of months after his engagement to Kate Middleton was announced .
It has been rumoured since the Duchess of Cambridge 's pregnancy was announced that the couple would follow in Charles and Diana 's footsteps ; they brought William to Australia when he was just nine months old .
Prince George Alexander Louis was born just over three weeks ago and William also spoke about what life was like with a newborn . ""
He 's pretty loud but of course very good - looking , "" he said .
"" I have to say that I thought search and rescue duties over Snowdonia were physically and mentally demanding but looking after a three - week - old baby is up there . ""
The last royals to visit Australia were the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall , who toured the country last year as part of the Queen 's diamond jubilee celebrations .
The trip to Australia will be William and Kate 's third tour together , having previously visited Canada in 2011 and south - east Asia in 2012 ."
2013-08-19,"Prince George of Cambridge is "" a little bit of a rascal "" who does n't like to sleep much and is a wriggler when it comes to having his nappy changed â€ “ something which is , apparently , required very frequently .
This picture of the earliest days of a future king was revealed by his sleep - deprived father , the Duke of Cambridge , in his first interview since his infant son 's birth four weeks ago .
Speaking to the US cable network CNN 's correspondent Max Foster , a relaxed Prince William , 31 , admitted that having his newborn thrust into the spotlight before the media 's massed ranks , just hours after his birth , was perhaps not something he would have chosen .
"" It 's not somewhere I enjoy being .
I know that the position I 'm in , that 's what 's required of me , "" he said .
But he added that he and the Duchess of Cambridge were "" on such a high anyway "" that they were happy "" to show him off to whoever wanted to see him "" . ""
As any new parent knows , you 're only too happy to show off your new child , and proclaim that he is the best looking or the best everything , "" he said .
He was just thankful that the third in line to the throne "" was n't screaming his head off the whole way through "" .
Extracts from the interview were released as the couple also released the first official photographs of George â€ “ taken not by a celebrity photographer but by his grandfather , Michael Middleton .
The two informal snaps , taken in the back garden of the Middletons ' manor house in Bucklebury , Berkshire , in early August , show the young prince sleeping as his parents pose , with the couple 's cocker spaniel , Lupo , and the Middletons ' golden retriever , Tilly , also getting on the big moment .
In the interview , ostensibly to promote the Tusk Trust charity for endangered species in Africa , the duke revealed the emotional impact of fatherhood . ""
The last few weeks for me have been just a very emotional experience
â€ “ something I never thought I would feel myself . ""
He had discovered "" a lot of things affect me differently now "" .
His son , he said , was "" a little bit of a rascal â€
¦
So he either reminds me of my brother or me when I was younger , I 'm not sure . ""
He does like to keep having his nappy changed , "" added the duke , who changed his son 's first nappy .
"" I was n't allowed to get away with that .
I had every midwife staring at me : ' You do it .
You do it . '
"" Prince George was "" growing quite quickly "" and "" he 's a little fighter
â€
¦
He kind of wriggles around quite a lot
and he does n't want to go to sleep that much , which is a bit of a problem .
"" The duchess was up in the night more often that her husband , and doing "" a fantastic job "" .
The duke was looking forward to returning to his job as an RAF search and rescue pilot to "" get some sleep "" , he said in the interview , recorded before his recent return to his north Wales base .
William had practised securing his son 's car seat before attempting it in front of the cameras , and chose to drive his family from hospital himself , rather than using a chauffeur , which "" was really important to me "" .
He , his wife and brother Harry had grown up "" differently to other generations "" .
He liked to do things himself , when possible , he said .
"" And I do n't like fuss
so it 's much easier to just do it yourself .
""
He was , he admitted , "" reasonably headstrong about what I believe in "" and just doing things "" the way I know "" . ""
For me , Catherine , and now little George are my priorities .
And Lupo , "" he added , referring to their pet cocker spaniel , who is "" perfectly happy "" with the new addition to the family .
He would like , one day , to pass on his interest in Africa 's endangered species to his son .
But for the moment ? ""
At the moment , the only legacy I want to pass on to him is to sleep more and maybe not have to change his nappy so many times , "" he said ."
2013-08-19,"The Duke of Cambridge has spoken for the first time of his feelings about fatherhood , and of sleepless nights with his son , Prince George .
In his first inteview since his son 's birth on 22 July , he told CNN that the third - in - line to the throne was "" a little bit of a rascal "" . ""
He either reminds me of my brother or me when I was younger , I 'm not sure , but he 's doing very well at the moment . ""
"" He 's growing quite quickly actually .
But he 's a little fighter .
He wriggles around quite a lot and he does n't want to go to sleep that much . ""
William , 31 , admitted that his wife , the Duchess of Cambridge , took on the lions share of the night - time interruptions and was doing "" a fantastic job "" .
In the interview , recorded before he returned to work recently , he said he was looking forward to going back to his job as a Royal Airforce search - and - rescue pilot in order to catch up on sleep .
He told interviewer Max Foster : "" Well , as a few fathers might know , I 'm actually quite looking forward to going back to work [ to ] get some sleep .
So I 'm just hoping the first few shifts I go back
I do n't have any night jobs .
"" Reflecting on how fatherhood had changed him , he said : "" The last few weeks for me have been a very different emotional experience , something I never thought I would feel myself .
And I find , again it 's only been a short period , but a lot of things affect me differently now .
"" Speaking of the moment he and his wife introduced George to the public on the steps of the Lindo wing at St Mary 's hospital in Paddington , he said : "" I think more shock was the feeling I felt , but I was on such a high anyway , and so was Catherine , about George that really we were happy to show him off to whoever wanted to see him . ""
As any new parent knows , you 're only too happy to show off your new child and , you know , proclaim that he is the best looking or the best everything .
It 's nice that people want to see George .
I 'm just glad he was n't screaming his head off the whole way through . ""
Talking about having to secure his son in a car seat in front of the massed ranks of photographers , he said : "" Believe , me it was n't my first time
and I know there 's been some speculation about that .
I had to practice , I really did .
I was terrified it was going to fall off or the door was n't going to close properly .
So I had actually practised with that seat , but only once before . ""
He was asked about the decision for him , rather than a chauffeur , to drive his wife and son away from the hospital , and said : "" I am as independent as I want to be , same as Catherine and Harry .
We 've all grown up differently to other generations and I very much feel if that I can do it myself
, I want to do it myself .
"" There are times where you ca n't do it yourself and the system takes over , or it 's appropriate to do things differently .
But I think driving your son and your wife away from hospital was really important to me . ""
For me , Catherine and now little George are my priorities - and Lupo , "" he said .
referencing the couple 's cocker .
Speaking of his Tusk Trust campaign to save endangered species in Africa , William said he hoped to encourage his son to take an interest , as his father Prince Charles had encouraged him .
"" I 'll have toy elephants and rhinos around the room , "" he said .
"" We 'll cover it in lots of bushes and things like that , make him grow up as if he 's in the bush . ""
At the moment , the only legacy I want to pass on to him is to sleep more and maybe not have to change his nappy so many times . ""
The interview will be broadcast in full on CNN next month ."
2013-08-19,
2013-09-09,"Prince William has spoken of his desire that his baby son , George , will one day share his family 's passion for wildlife conservation and Africa â€ “ and , in the meantime , to get a bit more sleep .
"" I 'll have toy elephants and rhinos around the room , "" he said .
"" We 'll cover it in sort of , you know , lots of bushes and things like that .
Make him grow up as if he 's in the bush . ""
Speaking of the legacy he wishes to pass on to his son , the Duke of Cambridge said it would be "" terrifying and very sad "" if elephants and rhinos became extinct , not just for George , but "" for all the little Georges out there , all the children and grandchildren "" , adding that "" as my father has said in the past before , it 's true , it 's that family connection that you want to pass on , what you love and you enjoy , to your children . ""
In an interview to be screened as part of a documentary on Sunday by ITV in the UK and on CNN worldwide â€ “ a taste of which has now been published by the British television company â€ “
the duke states his determination to continue royal links in Africa , by building on his father 's conservation concerns and his mother 's humanitarian campaigns .
His grandmother , the Queen , was in Kenya , at Treetops Lodge , when she received the news her father , George VI , had died .
Prince Philip was the first president of the World Wildlife Fund UK before Prince Charles took over the role .
Willam 's own first joint overseas visit with Prince Harry was to Africa
and he proposed to Kate on Mount Kenya .
On Thursday the duke and duchess will be guests of honour at a ceremony to recognise unsung heroes of conservation organised by the Tusk Trust , of which he is patron .
Jane Treays , the documentary maker , revealed in a piece for the Radio Times how the duke had acknowledged the difficulties in fighting poaching .
"" Education is such a huge , important issue , to educate everyone involved in the illegal markets about the damage that can be done and the implications of what they are doing , "" he told her .
"" The wildlife is incredibly vulnerable and I feel a real protective instinct , more so now that I am a father , which is why I get emotional about it
â€
¦
You want to stand up for what is vulnerable and needs protecting .
Elephants , rhinos and many other animals that are persecuted do n't have a voice . ""
Treays wrote that William became emotional when shown footage of a "" butchered rhino bleeding to death .
Tears well in his eyes
and he confesses to everything being changed by the birth of his son . ""
The duke says in the documentary : "" It 's just so powerful .
You 'd think something that big and that 's been around so long , would have worked out a way to avoid being caught and persecuted , but they really do n't .
I do feel anger , but I also feel really great hope that we will overcome this as a human race . ""
William also spoke of his own sense of freedom in Africa , while recognising the daunting family legacy .
"" My mother would come back with all these stories , full of excitement and passion for what she had been doing and I used to sit there , quite a surprised little boy , taking it all in â€ “ and the infectious enthusiasm and energy she had rubbed off on me â€ ¦ "" Being out in the middle of nowhere in Africa , looking at the projects , seeing the beauty of nature and the natural world , is just phenomenal , "" he said .
"" I love the fact you can go into any village in Kenya or the east coast of Africa and just walk in and have a chat with someone and they have absolute no idea who you are . ""
How often does he think of Africa ?
"" I 've got hundred of animals on my iPhone , noises and sounds of the bush , so if I am having a stressful day , I 'll put a buffalo , a cricket or a newt on and it takes you back instantly to the bush .
And it does completely settle me down . ""
Asked by Treays about the legacy for his son he laughed : "" At the moment , the only legacy I want to pass on to him is to sleep more and maybe not to have to change his nappy quite so many times , but as he gets older
I 'm sure he 'll pick up the bug of conservation . """
2013-09-12,"The Duke of Cambridge has left operational duties in the armed forces after completing his tour as an RAF search and rescue helicopter pilot , Kensington Palace has announced .
The duke carried out his last shift on Tuesday and is now working towards expanding his core charitable interests , particularly in the field of conservation of endangered species .
He will continue to carry out royal engagements but is not expected to increase his number of public duties .
Kensington Palace said his decision to make this a "" transitional "" year while he considers options for public service was taken before his son , George , was born in July .
A further announcement about the shape of his next role will be made within the next 12 months .
The duke was widely expected to leave the military and return to London with his wife and Prince George , rather than opt for another tour of duty with the RAF .
The duke was known as Flight Lieutenant Wales in the air force and was based at RAF Valley on Anglesey .
During his three - year tour he took part in 156 search and rescue operations , with 149 people being rescued .
At a country show on Anglesey last month , the duke spoke movingly about his time in Wales , saying : "" This island has been our first home together , and it will always be an immensely special place for us both .
Catherine and I look forward to returning again and again over the coming years with our family . ""
Kensington Palace said the new parents were expected to move into their recently refurbished apartments in the palace in the coming weeks .
Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford said during his tour that the prince had helped saved lives in the most demanding of conditions : "" Flight Lieutenant Wales has been an integral part of the Royal Air Force 's search and rescue force , as a Sea King pilot on No 22 Squadron â€ ¦ for the past three years . ""
Throughout his tour his airmanship , often in the most demanding of conditions , has contributed directly to saving lives in the mountains of north Wales and from the ravages of the Irish Sea .
He has earned the respect of all who have worked with him as a highly professional and competent pilot . ""
The duke began his military career more than seven years ago when he followed his younger brother , Prince Harry , into Sandhurst .
After St Andrews University he began 44 weeks of training at the royal military academy in Camberley , Surrey , where the course is designed to push new recruits to the brink of exhaustion and shape cadets into army officers .
By signing up , the then 23-year - old prince was continuing a historic family tradition of military service and he became the most senior royal in recent memory to attend the college .
In December 2006 , he graduated and was commissioned into the British army as an officer .
The Queen , the Prince of Wales , the Duchess of Cornwall and William 's then girlfriend , Kate Middleton , gathered to watch him in the passing - out parade which marked the end of his training .
William went on to join Harry 's regiment , the Household Cavalry 's Blues and Royals , and was promoted to lieutenant in 2007 .
Continuing his career in the forces , he received his RAF wings from his father at RAF Cranwell in April 2008 after completing an intensive 12-week flying course , thus becoming the fourth successive generation of the monarchy to become an RAF pilot .
He faced criticism later that month after he was allowed to practise landing a Chinook helicopter in a field behind the Middleton family home and when he flew himself and his brother by Chinook to a stag do on the Isle of Wight .
The Ministry of Defence defended the flights as part of William 's training .
Kensington Palace said in a statement : "" His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge is to leave operational service in the armed forces . ""
He completes his tour with the Royal Air Force search and rescue force at RAF Valley , Anglesey , after more than seven - and - a - half years of full - time military service . ""
He will continue to support the work of the Queen and the royal family through a programme of official engagements , both at home and overseas , with the Duchess of Cambridge . ""
The duke will work closely over the next 12 months with the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry .
He will expand his work in the field of conservation , particularly in respect of endangered species .
"" The duke will continue to work with his charities on issues relating to children and young people , veterans and serving members of the armed forces ."

2013-09-13,"My last post was about the need to reduce demand for rhino horn and ivory in Asia to stem Africa 's current poaching crisis .
This week my inbox bulged with photos of mega - celebs trying to do just that .
Actor Edward Norton filmed a couple of public service announcements in New York on Tuesday to raise awareness of the illegal ivory trade , and yesterday Prince William , David Beckham and basketball player Yao Ming got together in London to film another brace of spots about rhino and elephant killing .
The ads will go out this year as part of campaigns put together by the nonprofit WildAid , working in conjunction with other organisations .
Beckham is a recent addition to a growing squad of pachyderm - protecting personalities .
Yao Ming has for years lent his name to various wildlife causes , including campaigns to end shark finning and the use of ivory .
Norton is the president of the US board of the Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust , which works in East Africa .
Prince William has a well - known love for the wilderness and has just launched United for Wildlife , an alliance of seven of the world 's largest conservation organisations whose first order of business will be tackling the illegal wildlife trade .
After the Duke of Cambridge did his turn in front of WildAid 's cameras , he spoke at the Tusk conservation awards ceremony to honor African conservationists .
One of the nominees for the 2013 awards is Kerri Wolter , a South African whose mission is to save some of Africa 's least - appreciated creatures , vultures .
I know Kerri by way of one of my oldest friends , Walter Neser , who I met in primary school .
While the rest of us slogged through high school and university , Walter was trying to be a bird , by which I mean he spent years figuring out how to pull hair - raising stunts in paragliders .
A few years ago he bumped into Kerri , at the time an earthbound vulture conservationist , and enticed her under his synthetic wing to soar with ' her ' animals for the first time ( see video below ) .
It was n't exactly red wine and roses , but it seems to have done the trick , because today they live and work together at the organisation that Kerri started .

Vultures are really good at finding freshly dead animals , which means that shortly after a rhino or elephant is killed by a poacher , its carcass is likely to have a kettle of dozens to hundreds of vultures circling in the sky above it .
When game rangers see these kettles nowadays , they immediately head out to find the carcass and get on the poachers ' trail .
Poachers seeking clean getaways are now poisoning the carcasses of the animals they 've killed to rid the sky of vultures .
Over 600 of the birds recently died after feeding on a poached elephant in Namibia , and hundreds more are known to have suffered a similar fate in recent years across Africa .
Along with powerline collisions and a lack of food , poisoning is now a major threat to vulture populations across the continent .
All species of African vultures breed slowly and have been losing numbers for years .
There are less than 10,000 Cape Vultures left - fewer than Southern White Rhinos - and only a few hundred of Africa 's population of Bearded Vultures .
Vultures are vital elements of Africa 's savanna ecosystems , efficiently cleaning up carcasses before they can spread disease .
Their decline highlights the downstream effects of poaching as well as the complexity of ecosystems .
When AIDS started ripping through Africa the organisations working to stop it attracted an enormous amount of funding and celebrity attention .
Many experts pointed out that this was to the detriment of other , less-'sexy ' diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria , which actually kill more people than HIV .
While the rising number of dollars and increasing celebrity time devoted to stopping rhino and elephant poaching is welcome -- Africa 's pachyderms really are in trouble -- we should n't forget the thousands of other species that are coming under increasing threat as a result of Africa 's burgeoning economic growth and increasing human population .

2013-10-17,"The Duke of Cambridge has conducted his first investiture ceremony .
With the steady hand of the Sandhurst - trained , Prince William wielded his great - grandfather George VI 's ceremonial sword to bestow two knighthoods without mishap and pinned a plethora of medals on proud chests with military precision .
Among the recipients gathered in the Buckingham Palace ballroom on Thursday was Wimbledon , Olympic and 2012 US Open champion Andy Murray , 26 , who had to undergo a dope test before collecting his OBE . ""
In middle of a drug test hahaha I 'm goin be late ! ! !
"" the world No 4 tweeted , though he made it on time , arriving with his girlfriend Kim Sears and his parents Willie and Judy in a chauffeur - driven people carrier .
Tennis star and prince chatted for about a minute .
"" Was it that long ? ""
Murray said afterwards .
"" It felt like it flew by . ""
The two talked about Murray 's recent back surgery , which has kept him off court .
He joked that he had received congratulatory notes from both the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge after his Wimbledon triumph "" and I told him her handwriting is fantastic compared to his "" .
"" It was obviously a big occasion , being his first one [ investiture ] .
He seemed pretty relaxed to me .
He gave everyone a fair amount of time .
I 'm sure he enjoyed it . ""
Investitures are part of the bread and butter of the royal diary and the day was another taste of what lies ahead for the duke , 31 , second in line to the throne .
His grandmother , the Queen , has personally conducted more than 610 since her first , on 27 February 1952 , when among other honours she bestowed the Victoria Cross on Private William Speakman , from Altringham and of The King 's Own Scottish Borderers , for his "" utter contempt at personal danger beyond praise "" during the Korean war .
The elderly monarch now suffers from bouts of sciatica and knee problems , not helped by having to stand for at least an hour during the ceremonies , which are held 25 times a year , and will undoubtedly be pleased to see her grandson step up .
The Prince of Wales , Duke of Edinburgh and other members of the royal family also deputise under a "" dispensation warrant "" when the Queen is unable .
The duke has recently left the RAF and is now on what officials term a "" transitional year "" while he searches for another full - time role and undertakes a growing number of royal duties to prepare him for eventual kingship .
He presented awards to diverse recipients from across the UK , including an OBE to television comedy producer Jon Plowman , an MBE to presenter Aled Jones and an MBE to Helen Butler , a woman dedicated to the conservation of red squirrels on the Isle of Wight .
Prepping up on each individual would have been one of the tasks he had to undertake beforehand , in order to chat knowledgeably to each .
However , there was no confirmation of reports that the duke practised sword - dubbing on the servants before his debut ."
2013-10-17,"With the steady hand of the Sandhurst - trained , the Duke of Cambridge wielded his great - grandfather 's ceremonial sword to bestow knighthoods without mishap at his first investiture ceremony .
His medal - pinning skills , however , fell somewhat short of the royal ideal as Prince William made his debut standing in for the Queen at Buckingham Palace .
The first recipient of the day , Dame Nicola Cullum , saw her insignia fall off immediately after being attached by the 31-year - old prince .
"" One of the chaps picked it up , "" Cullum , professor of nursing at the University of Manchester , said later , preferring to blame her curtsey rather than the prince .
As he dispensed gongs William may have reflected he has plenty of opportunities ahead to improve his performance at this royal diary staple .
His grandmother has conducted more than 610 investitures in her reign , and his father , Prince Charles , has been doing it since the age of 28 .
The Queen , at 87 , who has problem knees and suffers from sciatica , will undoubtedly be glad of her grandson 's help .

2013-11-13,"The full extent of the alleged phone hacking of the royal household , including aides of Prince Harry , Prince William and Prince Charles has been revealed at the Old Bailey , with the jury told of hundreds of voicemail interceptions .
The jury heard on Wedneday afternoon that Kate Middleton 's name featured on a second note seized from Glenn Mulcaire 's home marked "" electronic intel or eavesdropping "" , more than 130 calls had been made by the News of the World 's royal correspondent and by Mulcaire to Prince Harry 's private secretary and the pin number for her phone had been reset sometimes "" several times a day "" .
On the 13th day of the hacking trial , the jury was also told of widespread hacking of the phone of the former director of communications to Prince Charles and to Prince William 's former private secretary .
Middleton 's name featured in a document titled "" Electronic intel "" seized by police from Mulcaire , the private investigator hired by the News of the World , the Old Bailey heard .
The jury was shown another Mulcaire document during the trial on Tuesday in which Middleton was listed as a target .
The jury at the phone - hacking trial were shown details of the notepad entry which was headed by the words "" Services provided R "" .
Beneath that was the subheading "" ( Electronic intel ) or eavesdropping "" .
Mulcaire 's note then went on to say "" subject under assessment â€ “ to evaluate corridors of communications â€ “ traffic analysis all = profiles , storyboard , pictures "" .
It added : "" Areas covered â€ “ political , royals , showbiz / entertainment "" .
Beneath that a list of names were scribbled including that of Middleton ( now the Duchess of Cambridge ) , Prince Charles 's PR chief Paddy Harverson and the then private secretary to Prince William , Jamie Lowther - Pinkerton .
Also on the list were the words : "" Harry , William , Helen Asprey "" .
Asprey is Prince Harry 's private secretary ; Prince Charles 's former senior valet Michael Fawcett is also on the list .
Others on the list were PR executive Max Clifford and a former boyfriend of Sadie Frost .
Andy Coulson , News of the World editor at the time , was told in an email that a story the paper was planning to run on Prince Harry 's health had been "" scammed from Helen Asprey "" , the private secretary to Harry and brother William , the Old Bailey heard .
One message on Asprey 's mobile was from Dr Rod Jaques , then medical director of the Institute of Sport , a tape recording of which was later found at Mulcaire 's home , arranging a follow - up appointment for Harry , the jury was told .
In it , Jaques said "" Our mutual friend is very much better with his knee as you probably know and also mentioned a shoulder problem to me .
I think he can get on top of that fairly quickly and also there is infection in his heel .
He has been put on some antibiotics and is very much better .
Looking to see him at Barts on Monday "" .
Prosecutor Mark Bryant - Heron said the then News of the World royal editor , Clive Goodman , sent an email to Coulson on 22 January 2005 .
It read : "" Andy , want me to talk to Paddy [ Harverson ] about Harry .
The health info is from doc himself , scammed from Helen Asprey .
Harry and William 's PA so its solid . ""
Coulson responded by email "" He wo n't help will he "" , the court was told .
Coulson denies conspiracy to intercept mobile phone voicemails .
The following day , the News of the World ran an article about Harry 's knee and problems with a wound in his foot , which it said could delay his entry to Sandhurst , and mentioned he had an appointment the next day .
The court heard one call from Goodman 's landline to Asprey 's UVN â€ “ unique voicemail number â€ “ on 14 January at 7.30pm , lasted eight minutes and 13 seconds .
There were also calls from another News International line .
An email from News of the World news editor Greg Miskiw to Goodman on the same day , read : "" One explanation is that she 's reset it .
We will have another go later on . ""
In January 2005 , there were 18 calls to Aspery 's UVN â€ “ three from Goodman 's landline and 15 from another News of the World line .
Lowther - Pinkteron , former private secretary to Prince William also had his voicemail intercepted the jury heard .
In the space of two months in 2005 , there were 123 calls to his UVN .
Harverson , who worked as Prince Charles 's communications secretary 2004 and 2012 , was also said to have been targeted heavily by the News of the World .
Bryant Heron said phone records in 2005 and 2006 showed that there were 210 calls made to his phone 's voicemail box from three numbers over four months .
"" These are all hacks because they are made to the unique voicemail number , "" said Bryant Heron .
Some were from the landline of Goodman , some were from another News of the World landline and some from Mulcaire 's telephone , the court heard .
The jury was also shown a series of emails between Goodman and a newsdesk executive concerning a story about Prince William at Sandhurst .
He warns that they should n't show too much knowledge because it might be "" massively dangerous to source "" .
There was phone record evidence that Tom Parker Bowles , son of the Duchess of Cornwall , had his UVN accessed by both Mulcaire , and a News of the World landline number , the court heard .
Goodman was said to have sent an email to James Weatherup and Ian Edmondson , discussing Parker Bowles and his new cookery book on 10 February 2005 .
In it he wrote : "" Getting Greg to do a few dark arts "" .
Weatherup replied : "" Do n't know what you mean â€ ¦ "" The trial continues ."

2013-11-26,"A pharmacy assistant who worked at a medical centre at Sandhurst military academy has been given a nine - month suspended sentence for selling stories about Prince William and Prince Harry to a tabloid newspaper .
She was also ordered to do 200 hours of unpaid work by Mr Justice Saunders at the Old Bailey on Tuesday .
Tracy Bell , 35 , from Barnsley in Yorkshire , received Â£750 for five articles about the royal princes between October 2005 and July 2006 , the court heard , and had pleaded guilty to one count of misconduct in public office at the earliest opportunity .
Saunders said Bell had "" made use of her position and the presence of members of the royal family at Sandhurst to make a profit out of selling information about them "" .
He said that although Bell did not hold a very senior post at Sandhurst , she was bound by the Official Secrets Act and by protocols in relation to the media disclosures .
"" Offences of misconduct in a public office are always serious .
The public are entitled to expect that those who hold a public office and are paid by the public will not abuse that trust by obtaining money from journalists .
This is not a case where it could ever be said that there was a reasonable excuse for disclosure . ""
The court heard that Bell had medical problems with her spine and had suffered domestic abuse around the time of the offences .
She had subsequently changed her life , had a new husband and had created a stable family environment for her three young children .
Saunders said the information that she supplied "" was relatively low grade and its disclosure has not caused significant damage to any public interest "" .
He also noted that she had lost her job and that there could be "" no doubt that her children would suffer significantly if she were sentenced to an immediate sentence of imprisonment today "" .
While in almost all circumstances an offence of misconduct in a public office will merit a sentence of immediate imprisonment , he said in this instance he could order the sentence be suspended ."
2013-11-27,"Prince William 's cover of Livin ' On A Prayer , a live collabo with Taylor Swift and Jon Bon Jovi , was surprisingly well - delivered .
Rather than go for the boozy ' woooaaarrgh ' delivery he instead seemingly drew inspiration from Abbie Alton off this year 's X Factor , who did it in trembly
John Lewis advert style â€ “ his mid - range tenor surfs smoothly beneath Swift , making him the perfect karaoke wingman .

2013-11-27,"Of all the bewildering sights you could ever expect to wake up to , the vision of Prince William performing as a backing singer for Jon Bon Jovi â€ “ wearing a tuxedo , wonkily honking a song about striking union members with his hands clasped in front of him in the royal familyâ€ ™ s
patented
â€œAnd
what is it
you do?â€ � pose â€ “ is right up there with the best of them .
However , a little more exploration reveals that Wills isnâ€ ™ t the first dignitary to wrongly assume that his position of power automatically makes him a world - class performer .
In many ways , his turn last night was merely the culmination of years of groundwork put in by generations of
unlikely rockâ€ ™ nâ€ ™ rollers before him .
Here are some of the best .
Vladimir Putin is , in many ways , the worldâ€ ™ s scariest internet meme .
Whether heâ€ ™ s posing topless for a selection of startlingly macho photographs or performing a version of On Blueberry Hill in such an unapologetically louche way that it makes Dean Martin look like Ian Curtis , thereâ€ ™ s a suspicion that all he really wants from life is to make the front page of Reddit .
Look at him go , though .
The panache .
The spoken - word interlude .
The cold glare in his eyes that commands the guests to clap along under pain of death .
The man is a star .
Itâ€ ™ s one thing to simply stand next to Taylor Swift and yelp about being halfway there like Wills , but only a real professional has the nerve to perform a song of their own creation .
And thus former US attorney general John Ashcroft and his 2002 soft rock epic Let the Eagles Soar .
â€œThis
eagleâ€ ™ s place is in the sky , â€ � he sings , his unique vocal stylings suggesting that heâ€ ™ s standing on a fishing boat in a storm after a big lunch .
â€œSheâ€
™ s still got a lotta flyinâ€ ™ to do.â€ �
Spoiler alert :
the eagle is America .
Former Chinese leader Hu Jintao showed that he too was capable of embarrassing himself in public when he waded onstage and performed a song called Moscow Nights , backed by a number of middle - aged men who share his inexplicable lack of shame .
Strange stage presence , though .
Look at his arms .
They barely move for the entire duration of the song .
If only heâ€ ™ d taken notes from Putin .
The reasons these performances are funny , of course , is the juxtaposition of seeing a starched authoritarian try to mimic the loose sexual energy of a creative performer .
That isnâ€ ™ t the case with Silvio Berlusconi , though .
He oozes sexual magnetism whatever heâ€ ™ s doing , so putting him behind a microphone and asking him to croon an acoustic folk song just cranks his charisma up to 11 .
His mouth might be singing , but his eyes are telling you to wait for the afterparty .
Interestingly , Wills ' singing is the first real sign of royalty being willing to perform in public .
Princess Eugenie visibly shrank away when BeyoncÃ © shoved a microphone in her face during a concert this year , and the Queen does n't sing along to the national anthem , even though it 's all about how brilliant she is .
In fact , all Wills really had to compete with until now was his dad dancing the Hokey Cokey .
But politicians ?
They ca n't get enough .
And then , obviously , thereâ€ ™ s Barack Obama ; a man who basically used his singing voice to win an election .
When he serenaded Al Green with a version of Letâ€ ™ s
Stay Together , the world went crazy .
But he managed to top it by singing Sweet Home Chicago with Buddy Guy .
Or , more realistically , singing one line of Sweet Home Chicago , trying to hand the microphone back , failing to hand the microphone back , being forced to sing another line of Sweet Home Chicago with a mixture of fear and anger in his eyes and then running away .
Heâ€ ™ s the best ."
2013-11-27,"He had Ellie Goulding perform at his wedding and booked Pharrell and Kanye for the Concert For Diana , and now Prince William continues to hover his finger at least vaguely near the pulse , singing with pop - country star Taylor Swift and rock veteran Jon Bon Jovi on a cover of the latter 's Livin ' On A Prayer .
The ad hoc performance took place at the Winter Whites charity gala , hosted by the Duke of Cambridge at Kensington Palace to raise money for homeless charity Centrepoint .
Leading Swift up to join Bon Jovi , William adjusted his cuffs in the manner of a cologne advert model , did some low - key ' soulful ' fingerclicks , and then gathered around the mic for the classic chorus .
With Bon Jovi taking the low notes and playing acoustic guitar , and Swift going for the big karaoke top line , William went for a well - executed mid - range harmony .
Elsewhere during the evening , Tinie Tempah performed an acoustic version of Written
In The Stars , and Swift performed her hit Trouble , as well as Love Story , which she said "" has reference to palaces , princes and princesses and it is very strange that I end up playing it in a palace ...
I do n't think I 've ever played at a palace before , so it is really wonderful . ""
She was full of praise for William , saying "" they 've done an amazing job of putting this together "" , echoed by Bon Jovi , whose JBJ Soul Foundation also tackles homelessness and poverty . ""
We came to join forces if you will , and throw a little international light on our foundation , "" he said .
Swift was also wrongfooted by some questions about Prince George from The Times 's royal correspondant , tellling him "" I love your accent , but I just do n't know what you 're saying . """

2013-11-30,"Does being second in line to the throne entitle one to be first to the Villa Park exit ?
That is the question Prince William may have found himself asking on his maiden visit to the home of the team he supports , as Aston Villa and Sunderland served up a no - frills draw fit for a pauper .
You could say it was heartening that neither team played above their usual standards just to impress a royal guest but this was better than Sunderland normally perform on their travels .
Sunderland had lost 13 of their previous 15 away league matches and had three players sent off in their last two so a clean sheet and a point amounted to progress .
Gus Poyet 's men might even have returned with a rare victory as they created the clearest chances in a scruffy game , Emanuel Giaccherini perpetrating an incredible close - range miss in the first half and Fabio Borini heading against the crossbar in the second .
But for most of the match the play was slovenly , with both teams guilty of making more misguided passes than boozed - up workers at an office Christmas party .
The tone was set in the warm - up , when Phil Bardsley and Andrea Dossena exchanged angry shoves after the Italian inadvertently tripped his team - mates .
That at least showed Sunderland had come to scrap .
Poyet was pleased . ""
A little bit of tension is nice , especially when you 're down at the bottom , "" he said .
Once the game kicked off there were only sporadic incidents of interest .
Gabriel Agbonlahor nodded a Fabian Delph cross wide from six yards in the third minute .
Two minutes later he missed again , sending a soft 20-yard shot into the arms of Vitor Mannone .
Sunderland then threatened for the first time when Steven Fletcher led a counterattack before feeding Dossena , who boomed a 20-yard shot into the side netting .
After that opening salvo of shots the game sunk into a tedium that was not relieved until the 30th minute , when Villa produced a smooth move that involved Karim El Ahmadi and Ashley Westwood , but Christian Benteke skied the ball from 12 yards .
The previously prolific Belgian has not scored for seven matches and was peripheral to most of the action in this match .
He looked low on confidence and a handful of Villa fans jeered when he was substituted towards the end .
Nearly everyone jeered Giaccherini just before half - time .
Borini rolled a short corner to the impressive Ki Sung - yeung , who delivered a cross to the back post .
Bardsley headed across goal to his compatriot , who seemed certain to tap into the net but , to the delight of the home fans , Giaccherini lifted the ball over the bar from three yards .
He nearly compensated for that in the 67th minute when he produced a wonderful cross for Borini , but the latter 's powerful header from eight yards bounced off the bar .
There were 23 minutes left but anyone who left early missed nothing else .
It could be a while before the Prince returns .
"" I do n't think he 'll be watching Match of the Day , "" said Paul Lambert ."
2013-12-05,"Rebekah Brooks approved a Â£4,000 payment for a photograph of Prince William in a bikini posing as a Bond girl when she edited the Sun , but never published the picture , the Old Bailey has heard .
The former News International chief executive was forwarded an email from a journalist on the paper when she was editor requesting the money for a contact at Sandhurst , the military academy where the prince was training in 2006 .
When asked "" What do you think , boss ? "" she replied "" OK "" , the hacking trial jury was told on Thursday .
Prosecutor Rebecca Chalkley said the picture was not published , but the Sun ran a "" mock - up "" of it , with William 's head superimposed on someone else 's body and the headline ""
Willy in a Bikini "" in September 2006 .
The article claimed "" Prince William caused a stir at a Sandhurst 007 bash by dressing as a Bond girl "" and added his then girlfriend Kate Middleton attended the party wearing a wetsuit and carrying a toy gun .
The jury was shown the email which read : "" My best contact at Sandhurst who has provided a string of great stuff over a period of months , offered us a picture of William at a James Bond party dressed as a Bond girl .
He is wearing a bikini and an open Hawaiian shirt . ""
The email continued that the person offering the photograph wanted Â£4,000 "" up front "" to pay for a course for his wife , but that the picture should only be used when Sandhurst was on its summer break .
The journalist added : "" He assures me that although this is not the way we would normally operate we would not be let down .
Indeed I already have the guy with the picture over a barrel because I know his identity . ""
The email was forwarded to Brooks . ""
Less than ten minutes later , she says OK , "" said Chalkey .
Brooks denies conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office .
Paddy Harverson , former communication secretary to Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall , told the jury he recalled a conversation with Brooks about the Sun proposing to publish a photograph of William .
He said the conversation , in August 2006 , was as a result of the Sun publishing pictures and a story about Prince Harry headlined "" Playboy prince cops a feel .
Dirty Harry "" .
The front page story and double spread inside alleged Harry was "" canoodling "" with a woman who was not his then girlfriend , the court heard .
Harverson said he told Brooks , then Wade , the Harry photographs were old and not recently taken .
Notes he made during the conversation were shown to the jury .
In them he wrote "" RW : my guy say did deal on Friday .
He claimed they were his pictures .
We knew him "" .
Harverson also wrote down Brooks saying : "" If we fucked up , what are we going to say . ""
Jonathan Laidlaw QC , for Brooks asked him if this was Brooks accepting "" and I wo n't use her language , but that ' we got it wrong ' "" over the Harry story .
Harverson agreed .
The paper had published an apology the next day , the jury heard .
Referring to the same notes , Laidlaw highlighted one other passage in which Harverson had written "" pic of PW in underwear wearing pink feather boa "" .
Laidlaw put it to him : "" There was a discussion , but it was about a different photograph .
About the prince in boxer shorts and a feather boa and not about the prince wearing a bikini .
""
Harverson said he told Brooks that if the Sun had a picture of William at a private party it would be in breach of his privacy to publish it .
He added : "" It was interesting to see they did n't publish the photograph . ""
Laidlaw told the jury the "" underwear "" photograph was never published by the Sun , but was published by the Sunday People in 2011 .
Detective inspector David Kennett , from the Metropolitan police 's Operation Elevden investigation into alleged illegal payments by journalists to public officials , was asked by Laidlaw if he had ever considered whether the email request for money that Brooks approved might have related to three individuals rather than two â€ “ and that a third individual might have been involved .
He replied he had not .
The court was also told Brooks repeatedly approved payment requests from a Sun journalist for his "" number one military contact "" who was a Ministry of Defence official when she was editor of the paper .
Brooks allegedly authorised the payments after the requests were emailed to her .
The journalist did not name the official in the emails .
The jury was told the money was paid to Bettina Jordan - Barber , an MoD employee .
Sums of between Â£500 and Â£4,500 were made for exclusive stories which the reporter described as "" massively picked up "" and "" good value for money "" , it was alleged .
The prosecution claimed the payments were made through a Thomas Cook branch .
The court was told of a string of emails between the reporter and Brooks .
One request allegedly sent to her for authorisation , and which was shown to the jury , read : "" Morning boss , I wonder if you could please approve the following payments for my number one military contact which are paid via Thomas Cook .
Your email okaying them is all the paperwork necessary . ""
The email included reference to three stories and the amounts Â£3,000 , Â£1,000 and Â£500 .
The court was told Brooks replied "" of course "" .
Another email from the journalist detailing a story asked if it was "" alright to pay the contact Â£3,000 "" for "" a belting exclusive "" .
Brooks allegedly replied "" brilliant scoop "" , adding "" of course on payments "" , the court was told .
The case continues .

2013-12-09,"An army brigadier who alleged the Sun had "" gone too early "" with a story about Prince William 's former Sandhurst commander being killed in Afghanistan , has told the Old Bailey he would not have made the claim had police shown him a crucial document .
The Sun ran its story "" Wills major killed by Taliban "" two days after Major Alexis Roberts was killed by an IED in Afghanistan on 4 October 2007 .
The prosecution in the phone hacking trial claims the details were passed to the newspaper by a Ministry of Defence official who was paid illegally .
Giving evidence at the Old Bailey on Monday , Brigadier John Donnelly , director of army personnel services , told the jury the convention was that the identities of fatalities were not made public before the families had been informed and given time to come to terms with the inevitable publicity that would follow .
The Sun had "" gone too early "" , he said .
The army had "" a duty of care "" to soldiers and their families , who had to "" be able to trust us to handle that information safely , securely and discreetly "" .
The consequences of publishing such information early was that it "" undermines the trust in us "" , he said .
Donnelly was giving evidence in the trial of former Sun editor Rebekah Brooks , who is accused of approving payments for information to senior MoD official Bettina Jordan - Barber .
Brooks denies conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office .
Under cross - examination by Brooks 's counsel , Jonathan Laidlaw QC , Donnelly agreed when he made his statement police had not shown him a "" fatality notice "" published by the MoD the day before the Sun 's article appeared , and in which Roberts was named and his widow "" quoted "" .
It was , Laidlaw said , a press notice published after next of kin had been notified "" and are ready for the inevitable publicity to follow "" . ""
It is clear , absolutely clear , that by 5 October [ 2007 ] the Ministry of Defence had got through all the essential preparation in respect of families and next of kin , "" said Laidlaw .
Donnelly confirmed he had not been shown the document by police when he made his statement , and queried whether the time on it was UK or Afghanistan local time . ""
Had the police shown you , do you think you would have made the statement you made on oath ? "" asked Laidlaw . ""
No , "" replied Donnelly , adding "" providing the time ( of the release ) is before the paper was published "" .
The Sun , which ran the story as an exclusive , had not named Roberts until its third edition on that particular day , the jury heard .
Other news organisations also named him around that time .
Another story , highlighted by the prosecution , concerned Corporal Bryan Budd , who was awarded a posthumous VC after being killed in Afghanistan during close - quarters combat with insurgents in Sangin , Helmand Province in 2006 .
It later emerged one bullet that hit him came from a Nato forces weapon .
The court heard that the Sun ran a story claiming he may have been inadvertently killed by one of his own comrades before the conclusion of a military inquiry or inquest . ""
The inquiry into how Corporal Budd had died needed to be concluded , and the widow briefed before that went into the public domain , "" said Donnelly .
Laidlaw said that the MoD press office had been briefed that they could tell reporters "" if pressed "" that the possibility of friendly fire was always present during close - quarter combat .
The prosecution allege that Brooks , when editor of the Sun , repeatedly approved email requests by a journalist to pay his "" number one military contact "" , whom , it is claimed , was Jordan - Barber .
Brooks , a former News International chief executive , denies conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office .
The trial continues ."
2013-12-19,"The News of the World intercepted and recorded intimate phone messages left between Prince William , Prince Harry and Kate Middleton , the Old Bailey has heard .
The voicemails included William using a pet name for his future wife and describing to her how he had nearly been shot during a training exercise , and a message for his brother in which he put on a high - pitched voice and pretended to be Prince Harry 's then girlfriend , Chelsy Davy .
Recordings of the messages were found by police in August 2006 when they searched the homes of the newspaper 's royal editor , Clive Goodman , and its specialist private investigator , Glenn Mulcaire .
On Thursday , at the phone - hacking trial , transcripts of the tapes were entered into evidence for the first time .
Prosecutors linked eight royal messages to internal News of the World emails , payment records and stories published by the paper in 2006 .
In one message , left by William for Middleton on 26 January 2006 when he was a cadet at Sandhurst , he said he had just got back from a night navigation exercise : "" I 've been running around the woods of Aldershot chasing shadows and getting terribly lost , and I walked into some other regiment 's ambush , which was slightly embarrassing because I nearly got shot .
Not by live rounds but by blank rounds , which would be very embarrassing though . ""
He ended by saying that he would be on another exercise the following day , adding : "" I might send a cheeky text message cos I might have my phone with me . ""
The next day , Goodman emailed his editor , Andy Coulson , to tell him of the story which , the jury were told , was then published in Goodman 's Black Adder column .
During the following week , Goodman and Coulson exchanged emails about payments for "" Matey "" who , the crown alleges , was Glenn Mulcaire .
Goodman sent Coulson a list of stories for which "" Matey "" had been paid , including the item about William and the night exercise .
The jury were told of two other voicemails left by the prince for Middleton in January 2006 .
In one he told her he had just picked up her messages and added "" Oh , my little babykins ! ""
In the other , he told her he was feeling "" a bit shitty "" after a couple of nasty days on exercises and that he might try to go beagling â€
“ hare chasing â€ “ with friends later that day .
On 28 January , Goodman emailed Coulson to suggest a story about William beagling , adding that it was "" going to be very tricky to stand up "" .
Goodman suggested he might put it to St James 's Palace 's director of communications , Paddy Harverson : "" Want me to put it to Paddy as a plain fact , eyewitness account ?
They visited the pub first so a punter could easily have seen them and called it in . ""
Coulson , three minutes later , replied : "" Yes . ""
The jury was shown the transcript of a recording found at Goodman 's home in August 2006 , in which he spoke to a palace press officer about the story , commenting that she sounded "" worryingly like Rebekah Wade "" and then arguing that the prince 's beagling outing was against Sandhurst rules .
That weekend , the jury were told , the News of the World published a story about William and the beagling which included the claim that he was in the habit of calling Middleton "" Babykins "" .
On the evening of 23 February 2006 , the prince left a message for Middleton : "" It 's now six o'clock , just gone six , but I do n't think I 'm probably going to be able to leave here till about seven .
I 've got about another hour worth of stuff to do , just little bits and pieces
but hopefully i should be able to leave by seven at the latest
so I 'll give you a buzz when I 'm in the car . ""
He added that he hoped to be with her "" by quarter to eight at the latest . ""
At 7.17 that evening , Goodman emailed his news editor , Ian Edmondson : "" William is out of Sandhurst tonight .
He is due to leave 7ish and is heading straight to see Kate .
From the inf I 've got , it looks like he 's going to her parents ' place near Reading .
The London address is just too far away for the ETA . ""
On 9 April 2006 , the News of the World published a story headlined "" Chelsy tears strip off Harry "" which claimed Davey had been angry with the prince for flirting with a stripper in a club .
The story claimed William had left a message on his brother 's phone , pretending to be Chelsy , saying : "" I see you had a lovely time without me .
But I miss you so much , you big ginger .
"" The jury were told that in August 2006 , police searching Mulcaire 's home found a tape on which a male , speaking in a female voice , left a message on Harry 's phone : "" Hi .
It 's Chelsy here .
I just want to say I miss you so much
and I think you 're the best - looking ginger I 've ever seen .
"" Three of the messages were left for royal staff .
One was from a doctor who had been treating Prince Harry for minor injuries , which was left on the phone of the prince 's personal private secretary , Helen Asprey .
The injuries became the subject of a story by Goodman .
Two were left for Jamie Lowther - Pinkerton , private secretary to Harry and Prince Charles .
In one , Harry asked for help with an essay at Sandhurst , a request which was published soon afterwards by Goodman , the jury heard .
In the other message left for Lowther - Pinkerton , the commandant of Sandhurst , General Andrew Ritchie , said he wanted to chat about "" an incident at the ball last night "" .
On 14 April 2006 , Goodman emailed his deputy editor , Neil Wallis , reporting that Ritchie had made the call the previous day and claiming that "" William and his group were massively drunk and upsetting other guests with their braying Hooray Henry antics .
One of his friends was strutting around the hall pretending to be a brigadierâ€ ¦
William himself was sent upstairs to bed before the ball ended . ""
Wallis replied : "" Remind me how we know this is true . ""
Dealing with the same story , Edmondson emailed Goodman suggesting he add an extra detail about the prince 's behaviour , to which Goodman replied : "" That 's a bit too much knowledge to expose to a wider readership . ""
The News of the World then published a story about the incident at the ball .
The jury were told that a payment of Â£3,000 was subsequently authorised for the story for a source known as "" Alexander "" , who is said by the crown to be Mulcaire .
The jury were shown further internal emails including one from Goodman to Coulson , dated 23 February 2005 , in which he claimed that the Sun had discussed a story with Harverson and that it had then leaked to the Daily Mail . ""
The Sun are keen to blame Harverson , "" he wrote .
"" He 's a complete halfwit , but what would leaking a Sun tale get him ?
The Mail is never going to cut Charles a break no matter how much help Paddy gives them .
More likely to be closer to home .
Or someone hacking Paddy 's voicemail ?
I can see if that s poss or if its massively password protected . ""
Andy Coulson , Stuart Kuttner and Rebekah Brooks [ formerly Wade ] deny conspiring to intercept communications .
The jury began a Christmas break on Thursday night .
The trial is due to continue on Monday 6 January ."
2013-12-19,"The News of the World hacked voicemail messages from Prince William to Kate Middleton , including one in which he "" nearly got shot "" by blank rounds in an army training exercise , a court has been told .
Transcripts of intimate and private messages left by the prince while he was training at Sandhurst military academy in which he call Kate , his future wife , "" baby "" and "" babykins "" were read to the jury in the hacking trial at the Old Bailey on Thursday .
The intercepted voicemails produced a string of exclusives for the paper including one headlined "" Harry aide helps out in Sandhurst exams "" and another revealing that William was out "" beagling "" .
It is the first time the now - defunct tabloid , owned by Rupert Murdoch , has been accused of illegally intercepting the voicemails of anyone directly related to one of the royals .
Up to now it has only been known that royal household staff were hacked by the paper , leading to the conviction of the News of the World 's former royal editor , Clive Goodman , and the private investigator used by the paper Glenn Mulcaire in 2007 .
Transcripts of the voicemails were uncovered at the time of their arrest in 2006 but have not been revealed in public before .
The voicemails were deemed relevant and were used to make the connection between stories in the paper , internal emails and hacked voicemails .
The jury was also told of a call from Sandhurst commandant Andrew Ritchie to Prince William 's private secretary Jamie Lowther - Pinkerton , complaining about his antics at Prince Harry 's passing out ball at the military academy . ""
Jamie , good morning , It 's Andrew Ritchie .
I 'd like to have a chat with you this morning if you could ring me back about an incident at the ball last night .
I 'm in the office till about 12.30pm and it would be great to hear from you before then if possible .
Bye .
"" The jury was then shown an email from Goodman to Neil Wallis , the deputy editor and Ian Edmondson , the head of news , dated 14 April 2006 .
He told them that "" General Ritchie "" had called about "" incidents "" at the ball in which "" William and his group were massively drunk and upsetting other guests with their braying , hooray Henry antics "" .
Goodman told them that "" William himself was sent upstairs to bed before the ball ended "" while "" another was regaling guests with an anecdote about how his wallet had been stolen by a hooker by the night before . ""
The jury was then shown a front - page story on the News of the World headlined "" So silly Willy "" with a reference to a "" hooker "" . ""
Boozy Prince William and his gang of braying pals outraged guests at Prince Harry 's passing - out ball with disgraceful drunken antics , "" it read .
In the first voicemail transcript the jury heard , Prince William left a message telling Kate he had just finished training and told her how he had nearly got shot in an ambush on a dummy exercise .
He started by saying "" Hi baby "" , and then went on to explain his day .
"" I had a busy day today again .
I 've been running around the woods of Aldershot chasing shadows and getting terribly lost , and I walked into some other regiment 's ambush , which was slightly embarrassing because I nearly got shot .
Not by live rounds but by blank rounds , which would be very embarrassing though . ""
Um , er , yeah , I 'm off on exercise tomorrow morning , just for the day , and then I 'm back on Saturday first thing , erm , so I probably wo n't be able to speak to you tomorrow night . ""
He then told her he might send her "" a cheeky text message "" because he might have his phone with him before signing off : "" All right , baby , lots of love , um , speak to you soon .
Bye bye . ""
An internal News of the World email later sent by Goodman to colleagues subsequently helped identify a resulting story for the paper , telling them "" William shot in ambush "" .
The News of the World subsequently ran a story in the Blackadder column edited by Goodman which read "" Prince William got ' shot ' in a military ambush "" .
The other transcripts included one in which Williams addresses Kate as "" babykins "" .
This nickname then appeared in an "" exclusive "" by Goodman on 12 February 2006 which went on to say that "" Wills wants the girl he calls ' babykins ' to be his princess "" .
In another voicemail , William told Kate he was going to secretly get away from Sandhurst and was hoping to get to her parents ' house .
He said he was going to "" try to go beagling today
and then I 'm going to try to come to you afterwards "" .
In an email shown to the jury Goodman told the then News of the World editor Andy Coulson about William 's plans for beagling , noting that this is a story as leave is not allowed at Sandhurst .
He added : "" No leave for first five weeks , going to be dead tricky to stand up . ""
On a later date William called Kate and left a message telling her he is "" planning on coming out about 7-ish , so I will be with you about 7.45 at the latest .
Hope that 's all right .
Baby ca n't wait to see you .
Lots of love
and I 'll speak to you later ""
In an email Goodman told his then news editor Ian Edmondson : "" He was due to leave 7pmish "" and is planning to see Kate . ""
From the inf [ sic ] I 've got , it loos like he is going to her parent 's house near Reading "" because his "" ETA "" would n't give him enough time to make it to her London flat . ""
The jury heard that Prince Harry 's phone was also hacked .
They were told of an unidentified male voice phoning the prince , putting on a female voice and pretending to be Chelsy Davy , his then girlfriend who was holidaying in South Africa . ""
He puts on a false voice and tells how much he misses Harry , "" the prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the jury , adding that he also called Harry "" Ginger "" .
The jury were told by prosecutor Andrew Edis that another transcript was of a message left on Prince Harry 's voicemail by an "" unknown male message putting on female voice "" and then lapsing into a normal male voice .
This was later attributed to William by the News of the World .
The message refers to Harry as a "" big hairy fat ginger "" .
The transcript shown to the jury read : "" Hi , it 's Chelsy here .
I just want to say I miss you so much
and I think you 're the most â€ ¦ best - looking ginger I 've ever seen although you really are quite ugly for a ginger but hope you 're having a lovely time
â€ “ I really miss you .
It 's lovely out here in Africa
and hopefully I 'll see you very soon ,
you big hairy fat ginger .
Anyway , speak to you later . ""
A story in the News of the World headlined "" Chelsy tears strip off Harry "" included a reference to a phone call in which she told him how much she missed him and called him "" Ginger "" .
Readers were told that Harry "" sees the funny side "" .
The trial continues ."
2014-01-05,"As announced by Clarence House , Prince William has been granted a place on his own "" bespoke "" course devised by the Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership , of which his father , the Prince of Wales , is patron .
Understandably , other graduates and their parents are eager to know if similar opportunities might be available .
Frequently Asked Questions include : is a bespoke , masters - level course in running a duchy available at a university near me ?
And what of the Cambridge entry requirements ?
Is renaming yourself Cambridge a precondition , along with a biological connection with the CPSL 's patron ?
Do mature candidates need a 2:1 in geography from St Andrews or did the prince 's extensive experience in fancy dress and polo translate into a qualifying skill set ?
How does the University of Cambridge facilitate the learning needs of differently abled princes ?
Does this bespoke course , some also ask , illustrate a welcoming , commercial pragmatism that now allows virtually anyone to buy into Cambridge or , to the contrary , expose the university 's continued willingness to reserve special academic favours for male members of the British royal family ?
And just what is involved in a Duke of Cambridge bespoke course in agricultural management ?
From the outset , it should be stressed that , while being entirely accessible to non - princes , a course such as the University of Cambridge 's 10-week professional development course in Being Prince William is likely to appeal primarily to retired English princes of that name , preferably with previous experience in air - sea rescue and , more importantly , a proven interest in running a 133,000-acre private estate spread over 23 counties .
Although the issues and context are largely duchy or palace - specific , the practitioner - led faculty will ensure that participants in this course benefit from opportunities to network with non - landed students who share a common sustainability agenda , eg , during comfort breaks , while taking selfies , etc .
But the unique feature of this deep learning journey set in the heart of historic Cambridge will , as reported , be its delivery by a partnership between various university bodies involved with the respected occultist HRH the Prince of Wales , whose 1982 address to the BMA on Paracelsus 's four pillars of healing , first identified him as a catalyst for social change .
In every aspect , the Being Prince William course will train future princes to communicate the challenges of land ownership in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner and to think creatively about royalty solutions across economic sectors ( see in particular module 2 , facilitating an enabling environment for sustainable palace refurbishment ) .
Particular emphasis is placed on ethical and moral concerns ( see in particular module 3 , six homes or seven â€ “ how to live with less ) .
The course will seek to build the future sovereign 's capacity for sustainable reigning and create a safe space to explore , among other things , the knowledge networks that link international wildlife conservation and locally holistic fox disposal , and to reconcile sustainability with innovative thinking on duchy profitability , currently estimated at no more than Â£19 m per annum .
Length and dates of course : 10 weeks , 11.30 - 11.45am , Mondays - Tuesdays , coffee and sustainable refreshments incl .
Academic requirement : at least a C in GCSE Twister , or equivalent , but this could also be three to five years ' relevant vacation experience in an aquatic role or similar .
For those with a strong surfing / jet - ski background , Cambridge has several faculty members who are leaders in the areas of lolz and advanced banter .
The William course is delivered by a world - class faculty that includes senior courtiers and contemporary bowing practitioners .
Excellent maths ability is essential and you should not apply if you are unable to employ someone with the relevant skills .
English language requirement : proficiency is vital at a very high level and all candidates must have the Oxford reading tree to level five , The Magic Key , or be fluent in plant .
Adherence to this requirement is strict .
But the language requirement may be waived , at the discretion of the academy , for any candidate able to make an unusually strong commitment to the advancement of magical thinking in Cambridge , eg by endowing a relevant institute .
Note to parents : normally this investment comes with the guarantee of an en - suite bathroom in your child 's college of choice .
Applicants should provide a letter from their father confirming that the relevant duchy funds are in place and a character reference from the Queen .
Although this course does not result in a formal qualification , and no certificates are offered , all successful candidates will receive a ( bronze ) sustainability badge on completion , entitling the holder to a discount at Waitrose .
Moreover , as patron , the Prince of Wales holds regular symposiums at which CPSL alumni can explore commercial responses to what he has identified as "" the nightmare that for so many of us now looms on the horizon "" .
The bespoke William programme consists of core courses , providing a rigorous grounding in rent collection , upscale biscuit manufacture and the covert exploitation of the duchy 's legislative vetos .
A range of elective modules will cover all the main duchy areas of sustainable tax avoidance and exemption , accompanied by an extended assignment enabling the integration of ethical theory and practice in the sphere of duchy business transactions , whose exact nature can not be publicised in case Margaret Hodge finds out .
Throughout the course , with its focus on experiential learning , duchy accountants and bailiffs will demonstrate how to seize intestate assets still legally due , under the process of bona vacantia , to the absolute owners of medieval fiefdoms who only pay tax voluntarily .
The Prince of Wales will himself offer private tutorials in coercive letter writing ( green ink is provided ) , for ethical adjustments in public policy ; also lectures on contemporary resilience , starting this week with "" The perils of cheap food "" .
It is his experience , the prince will say , that "" if you drill down into what is actually happening "" , inexpensive diets are a killer .
"" We all know that type 2 diabetes and other obesity - related conditions are rapidly on the increase . ""
In lecture two , he sets out the extraordinary resilience of iconic , Duchy Original biscuits , now available with a dark chocolate coating .
Due to the heavy academic demands of this course , participating dukes will be expected further to reduce their official engagements for the duration .
In the interests of transparency , all course work will be submitted to an external examiner , the Duchess of Cornwall .
Possibly anticipating the objection that , as a nod to post - Restoration values , William might have chosen a less self - serving line of study , even picked an institute not founded by his father , the palace states : "" The duke is considering a number of options for public service , a further announcement on which will follow in due course . ""
But it need not have bothered .
If the last week is any guide , British subjects would react with joy and admiration to the news that William is to spend the next three months inside a secluded Kensington salon , studying organic solutions to male - pattern hair loss ."

2014-01-08,"Do n't discriminate against Prince William Prince William should n't be discriminated against at Cambridge University because of the circumstances of his birth , a professor has said .
William travelled to Cambridge to study a tailored 10-week agricultural course this week and has already been criticised by some students .
Speaking to the Cambridge News , Prof Ross Anderson , of Cambridge University 's Computer Laboratory , defended William 's acceptance onto the course and warned against discriminating against the Prince .
He said : "" Colleagues and I sometimes organise special courses for people from industry who want to learn about the latest research in our field .
For this we charge them money .
Whether they have any A - levels at all is no more relevant than the price of tea in China . ""
Anderson warned that Prince William "" should not be discriminated against on account of the circumstances of [ his ] birth "" .
The university 's decision to accept William as a student has caused controversy over the past few weeks , with some students criticising his acceptance onto the course .
One Cambridge student said in the Tab that : "" Normally students need A*AA at A - level to gain entry to Cambridge University , whilst the Prince only achieved a mediocre ABC . ""
Red cards for laddish behaviour University professors have used red cards to discipline disruptive male students , according to a professor who has researched laddishness at university .
Research carried out by Prof Carolyn Jackson , of Lancaster University , focused on sports students .
It found that some lecturers had resorted to using yellow and red cards , a technique used in primary schools , to combat laddishness .
Students would first be threatened with a yellow card and would then be removed from the lecture if their behaviour did n't improve .
According to researchers , symptoms of laddishness included being loud , being a joker , throwing stuff , arriving late and being rude and disrespectful to lecturers .
Win for international students at Southampton uni The student union at Southampton University has won a fight for international students to have fixed fees .
Up until now , fees were set by year rather than for the whole degree .
This meant international students were paying higher fees every year of their studies .
David Gilani , president of the student union , says : "" All students arriving from the 2015/16 year onwards will have fixed fees .
This means that each student has certainty over what their degree will cost them . ""
Student halls hit by storms at Aberystwyth On Monday around 150 students at Aberystwyth were evacuated from student halls after storms threatened their seafront digs .
The students were put up by the uni in alternative accommodation at another campus , but have been allowed to return home after final safety checks .
Will Ray , an Msc student in remote sensing geography , lives in student accommodation on the seafront and was evacuated on Friday .
He says : "" On Friday morning I was jolted awake by the building shaking .
I live in the second floor flat and the waves were breaking over our window .
At about 11 am we lost power . ""
In the four years that I 've been studying here I 've never experienced anything like this . ""
Ray says that the sea threw gravel up to the accommodation , and that the ground floor flats suffered from flooding .
Rebecca Davies , pro vice - chancellor for student and staff services , says : "" The past few days have been difficult for those living in sea front halls and we are very pleased to finally be in a position to let everyone return to their accommodation . ""

2014-02-05,"Richard Kay , the Daily Mail 's gossip columnist , wrote his final column today : "" Farewell after ten terrific years of society scoops .
"" It was appropriately illustrated with a picture of the Duchess of Cambridge , about whom he has written continually since he took up his post in 2003 after the departure of his predecessor , Nigel Dempster .
He begins his last piece about his "" fascinating journey of discovery around the adventures and misadventures of the men and women who make up British society "" by writing : "" Tony Blair was in Downing Street , Prince Charles was yet to make an honest woman of his mistress Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles and Kate Middleton was the middle - class girl who shared Prince William 's student digs , but not his heart . ""
His diary "" about the monied and the powerful , the glamorous and the well - connected , as well as the imposters and the wannabes "" was different in many respects from Dempster 's , not least because of changing nature of British society .
He notes : "" The aristocracy and the great noble families have been cast ever further to the margins by the galloping meritocracy .
Soap stars and reality TV figures have hogged the headlines and the new rich have elbowed aside the old - style landed toffs . ""
But he believes the royal family are making comeback in popularity even if the old order below them is crumbling .
He also recalls having "" crossed swords with Cherie Blair , the Aga Khan and others who used their great wealth to stifle comment they did n't like . ""
And it reminds him of Dempster 's quote about such hostility going with the territory : "" Brickbats are the rosettes of the gossip column . ""
Kay , 56 , who has worked at the Mail since 1980 , is set to take up a new role at the paper .
He rose to prominence as the Mail 's royal correspondent and famously befriended , and was befriended by , Princess Diana .
As I reported in November , his place is being taken by Sebastian Shakespeare , who previously ran the Londoner 's Diary in the London Evening Standard ."
2014-02-09,"Prince William went on a deer and wild boar hunting trip in Spain a day before he launched a high - profile appeal to stop the illegal hunting of wildlife , it has emerged .
There is no suggestion the hunting trip was in any way illegal , but critics have suggested that the timing of the holiday was poor , coming before an appeal close to the prince 's heart .
In a message broadcast on Sunday , the Duke of Cambridge and his father , Prince Charles , called on people to help save endangered animals such as rhinos , elephants and tigers .
A royal spokesman said the duke , who quit the RAF last year to lead a new global conservation group , United for Wildlife , was a "" passionate advocate "" on the subject .
The BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell questioned the timing of the trip , which was also attended by Prince Harry , the Sun reported .
"" Such a trip is a world away from shooting endangered species for profit , but some may feel that to go hunting himself just as he launches a high - profile campaign is , at the very least , ill - timed , "" Witchell said .
A royal spokesman said : "" The Duke of Cambridge has for many years been a passionate advocate for endangered wildlife and has campaigned tirelessly to help stop the illegal poaching of rhino horn and elephant tusk .
His track record in this area speaks for itself .
"" In the broadcast , William and Charles make appeals in languages including Mandarin , Arabic and Swahili to stop the illegal wildlife trade .
Prince Charles , president of the wildlife charity WWF UK , starts the message with a warning that the trade has reached "" unprecedented levels of killing and related violence "" and poses a threat not only to endangered animals but to economic and political stability around the globe .
He says : "" More than 30,000 elephants were killed last year , amounting to nearly 100 deaths per day .
In the past 10 years , 62 % of African forest elephants have been lost .
If this rate continues , the forest elephant will be extinct within 10 years .
A rhinoceros is killed every 11 hours .
As recently as 100 years ago , there were as many as 100,000 wild tigers living in Asia .
Today , there are believed to be fewer than 3,200 left in the wild . ""
The duke , who is royal patron of the wildlife conservation charity Tusk Trust , says he wants future generations , including his son , George , to be able to appreciate protected wildlife . ""
This year , I have become even more devoted to protecting the resources of the Earth for not only my own son but also the other children of his generation to enjoy , "" he says .
On Wednesday the duke will attend a United for Wildlife symposium at the Zoological Society of London , followed by an evening reception at the Natural History Museum to mark the start of a high - profile wildlife conference hosted by the British government .
The conference , held at Lancaster House in London , will host policymakers and campaigners from 50 countries , and there will be speeches from Charles and foreign secretary , William Hague .
The conference aims to tackle the wildlife trade by strengthening law enforcement , reducing demand for illegal products and supporting sustainable livelihoods for communities in affected areas , according to the government ."
2014-02-10,"Morrissey has accused the royal family of hypocrisy after Prince Charles and Prince William went on a hunting trip in Spain a day before issuing a plea for wildlife protection .
Calling the Prince a â€œthickwitâ€ � and labelling the monarchy â€œa colossal embarrassmentâ€ � to the UK , the blogpost is entitled â€œThis story is old , I know , but it goes onâ€
� and was posted on his fansite True to You .
Although Williamâ€ ™ s speech ( no doubt written by his publicity aides at Clarence House ) will concentrate on endangered species , William is too thickwit to realise that animals such as tigers and rhino are only driven to near - extinction because people who are precisely like himself and his brother have shot them off the map â€ “ all in the name of sport and slaughter .
Whenever you shoot an animal in the head the outcome is usually the same : death .
Just why William kills innocent and defenceless deer does not matter â€ “ the fact is , he does it , and we must go on and on asking why any form of violence is acceptable to the British establishment .
Morrissey suggested that endangered species are dying out purely because of â€œpeople like William and Harryâ€ � .
The blogpost was written after the Duke of Cambridge and his father , Prince Charles , recorded a video message calling on the public to save endangered animals like rhinos , elephants and tigers .
The Sun reports that the Princes flew to Spain the day before giving the plea , where they hunted wild boar on a private estate .
Morrissey finished his blogpost by saying : â€œWe can only pray to God that their hunting guns backfire in their faces.â€ �
In a piece written last November titled â€œThe world wonâ€ ™ t listenâ€ � , Morrissey â€ “ a longstanding critic of the monarchy â€ “ criticised its elevated role in society .
â€œWe are continually told ( warned ? ) that we love the â€˜royalsâ€ ™ whatever their conduct , and we see very clearly how this most dysfunctional family must â€ “ at all costs â€ “ leave a virtuous emblem on the age , as we also see how no British citizens ( for we are not subjects ) can be considered qualified enough to question the â€˜royalsâ€ ™ â€ “ or to even be allowed to ask why it is thought necessary to have a monarchy in the first place â€ “ especially as most countries throughout the world exist quite well without royal boils â€ ¦ â€ �"
2014-02-12,"Ahead of a high - level summit on the illegal wildlife trade in London on Thursday hosted by the UK government , the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge told the world this week : We have come together , as father and son , to lend our voices to the growing global effort to combat the illegal wildlife trade - a trade that has reached such unprecedented levels of killing and related violence that it now poses a grave threat not only to the survival of some of the worldâ€ ™ s most treasured species , but also to economic and political stability in many areas around the world .
Prince Charles went on to echo comments heâ€ ™ s made before , about the need for a battle against poaching : We must treat the illegal wildlife trade as a battle , because it is precisely that .
The rising and apparently insatiable demand , much of it from Asia , has provided an economic incentive for trafficking to become increasingly criminalised and professional .
Organised bands of criminals are stealing and slaughtering elephants , rhinoceros and tigers , as well as large numbers of other species , in a way that has never been seen before , pushing many species to the brink of extinction .
Prince William also launched his new wildlife charity on Wednesday , United for Wildlife , a consortium of seven wildlife NGOs .
â€œIt is my hope you will become part of United for Wildlife and the global alliance to stop illegal trafficking of wildlife , â€ � he told experts from all over the world have been meeting today and yesterday at the Zoological Society of London ( ZSL ) .
They have been discussing in depth the kind of measures which will need to be endorsed at the highest level at tomorrowâ€ ™ s Lancaster House conference if the â€˜battle against illegal wildlife tradeâ€ ™ is to be won .
Iain Douglas - Hamilton , who lives in Kenya and has fought for decades to help ensure the survival of the African elephant , told the meeting : â€œIf there is one thing I have learned , itâ€ ™ s that half - measures donâ€
™ t work.â€ �
Dr Paula Kahumbu , who runs a Kenyan NGO called WildlifeDirect and blogs at the Guardian , explained that Kenyaâ€ ™ s new wildlife laws proscribed life imprisonment or a fine of Â£150,000 for the killing of an endangered species .
She wrote yesterday about how Kenya shows African governments can be part of the â€˜solutionâ€ ™ to the trade rather than being part of the problem , as they are sometimes perceived to be .
John Sellar , a British policeman who served for years as the chief enforcement officer of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( Cites ) and who only last week went to Buckingham Place to receive an OBE for services to conservation , declared in an impassioned speech : â€œWhat I care about , above all , is putting the bad guys behind bars.â€ �
Wildlife crime is big business , with some estimates putting its value at Â£20bn pounds a year .
The world tiger population numbered over 100,000 not much more than a century ago , but is now down to levels as low as 3000 today .
Debbie Banks noted : â€œfor every tiger killed , five or eight leopards are also killed , processed and sold by the same individuals.â€ � Debbie Banks , a campaigner for the Environmental Investigation Agency , said : â€œProactive , multi - agency , intelligence - led enforcement solutions that are used to combat other forms of serious organised crime , such as narcotics , will have a significant impact on identifying , apprehending and prosecuting key wildlife criminals , seizing the proceeds of crime and dismantling criminal networks.â€ �
Yet there have been some success stories .
Megh Pandey , head of Nepalâ€ ™ s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation , said that Nepalâ€ ™ s tiger population had increased from 95 in 1995 to around 198 today .
â€œThe government of Nepal has created law enforcement institutions from community level to prime - minister level aiming to control wildlife crime.â€ �
He pointed out that such efforts had to be complemented by habitat conservation and management
â€œthrough involvement of local communities in order to reduce human - wildlife conflicts and control wildlife crime for a long - term and sustainable management of the protected area
system.â€ �
Several of the participants at this weekâ€
™ s ZSL meeting will be participating in their countryâ€ ™ s delegations at tomorrowâ€ ™ s Lancaster House Conference on world wildlife crime .
The Heads of State who gather in London on Thursday are expected to agree a declaration , indicating their â€ “ and the worldâ€ ™ s â€ “ commitment to further action .
With the UK government acting as the official host of the meeting , David Cameron , the prime minister , and William Hague , the foreign secretary , have both cleared their schedules so as to be able to join the princes in Lancaster House .
Prince Philip , the Duke of Edinburgh , who served for many years as the international president of WWF , will be following proceedings closely .
It is not yet known what part Prince George will play .
If one clear message is to be carried from ZSL to Lancaster House , it is that conservation is too important â€ “ and perhaps too difficult and complex â€ “ to be left to the conservationists .
The whole panoply of law enforcement , including the latest techniques of monitoring and detection , must be deployed if the war against wildlife crime and trafficking is to be won .
Such decisions can only be taken at the highest political level ."
2014-02-14,"It was the nascent bald patch on one of the helpers and the strawberry blond mop on the other that gave the game away .
Since dawn , Princes William and Harry had been discreetly helping the flood relief efforts around the Berkshire village of Datchet with a platoon of soldiers from their regiment , the Household Cavalry , when their cover was finally blown by the Guardian .
Watching the TV pictures from their Kensington Palace apartments , the pair had been planning to get involved in a private capacity for a couple of days , and had hoped to keep out of the spotlight .
Shortly after 10 am , they were limbering up , about to put some royal muscle into lugging sandbags on to a flatbed train wagon by the village railway crossing when your reporter spotted them .
The princes , dressed in waterproofs and wellingtons , formed part of a human chain with soldiers and railway workers hauling heavy sandbags out of the back of an army vehicle as part of an effort to repair an area where water was flowing beneath the railway track from the village golf course and threatening homes on the other side .
Prince William dived into the back of the truck to help from there while Prince Harry stayed out in the rain and loaded up pallets alongside Miguel Head , William 's private secretary .
The princes did not seem entirely pleased to be spotted , perhaps especially not by a Republican - leaning newspaper .
As the Guardian filmed his exertions , Harry called out : "" You could come up here and help . ""
William followed up with : "" Why do n't you put your notebook down and give us a hand with the sandbags ? ""
An attempt to take up the offer was scotched by the princes ' minders , who made an odd excuse about your reporter â€ “ kitted out in wellies and waterproofs â€ “ wearing the wrong type of clothes .
Then after a briefing from the Network Rail man about the task in hand , they trooped off down the railway line , tried to repair the breach and trooped back about 40 minutes later looking tired and bedraggled before getting into a minibus which took them on to a nearby school where they helped build another sandbag wall , this time thronged by cameras and journalists .
Kensington Palace declined to comment on the visit , insisting it was a private affair .
A royal source said : "" The plan was to spend as long as they could without being happened upon .
It was mainly for the guys to show support for their army colleagues and they wanted to do their bit for the relief effort . ""
Prince Harry remains a staff officer in the Household Cavalry , while Prince William left the armed forces in September last year after nearly eight years .
For the beleaguered residents of the area , late on Friday hoping the heavy rains would not bring back the worst of the flooding , it was just another strange episode in a surreal week .
The princes were just the latest in a line of national figures to drop in on the stricken area , including the prime minister , David Cameron , the defence secretary , Philip Hammond , and the Labour leader , Ed Miliband .
It did not go unnoticed in Datchet that the princes were the only ones to offer more than words and let their back muscles do the talking ."

2014-02-15,"On the eve of the awards ceremony where she will receive the British film industry 's highest honour tonight – a Bafta fellowship , from Prince William – Dame Helen Mirren has criticised the growing number of dead women in British television drama .
Mirren told the Observer that she agreed with the playwright
David Hare 's recent complaints about the bloodthirsty nature of most drama on British TV , saying there was a clear sexual divide when it came to the corpses .
"" Most of those bodies are young women , "" she said .
Hare had spoken out against the number of murder victims on television at the launch of the second of his Worricker trilogy of films last week .
"" I ca n't personally stand the body count in contemporary drama .
I just think it 's ridiculous , "" he said .
The British playwright had added that the Nordic thriller series The Bridge was one of the biggest offenders , although he enjoyed it .
Fresh corpses also appear in many British - made dramas and series , such as Silent Witness , Lewis , Whitechapel , Ripper Street , What Remains and The Fall , the BBC2 drama serial starring Gillian Anderson , in which a rapist and serial killer preys on a string of attractive young women .
Mirren 's views about the level of violence in popular entertainment have come to light since she starred in the first of two Hollywood comic action thrillers , Red and Red 2 , alongside Bruce Willis and John Malkovich .
One of her early breakthrough film roles was as Victoria , Bob Hoskins 's girlfriend , in the violent and highly rated 1980 London gangster thriller
The Long Good Friday .
But two years ago Mirren asked the director of Red 2 , Dean Parisot , to make sure she was not depicted killing any of her victims in any of the sequences involving gunfire .
It was , Mirren feared , "" a losing battle "" , but she added : "" I do get terribly upset when I see films where people are just randomly shot .
I think they all have families to go to , children at home . ""
The 68-year - old said she would like to take on a fresh television role next , if she could avoid a violent plotline , because she believed much of the best writing was now done for television films and drama series .
"" I think British television has been very good for a long time .
When people in Hollywood used to ask me how the British film industry was , I would say : ' It is alive and well and on television ' .
Now I think the Americans have rather caught up on us and they too are producing great television .
Britain has been doing it right back to early Dennis Potter and Stephen Poliakoff
plays and all those serialised adaptations of the classics . ""
Before Mirren become widely known to television audiences for playing police inspector Jane Tennison in the award - winning Prime Suspect series in the 1990s , she appeared in acclaimed television films such as the 1979 film of Potter 's play Blue Remembered Hills and in Poliakoff 's Soft Target in 1982 .
The actress won one of her four Emmy awards in the US for portraying Elizabeth I for Channel 4 in 2005 .
She won another in 2007 for reprising the role of Tennison in The Final Act .
This weekend Mirren said she believed British acting was enjoying a great flowering and she spoke about her hopes for British victories tonight .
"" I know who I hope will be a big winner this year , "" she said at the Savoy event hosted by the Bafta sponsors Hackett . ""
And that 's 12 Years
A Slave –
I 'd love to see Chiwetel Ejiofor win
and obviously I 'd love to see the director , Steve McQueen , win too .
I know the film has already got lots of attention , but it would benefit from it because it would make more people see it . ""
Commenting on the number of black British actors to find recent success in the US , including Ejiofor , David Harewood and Idris Elba , Mirren said she had not found any resentment from black American actors in Hollywood .
"" We are only talking about four or five British actors anyway .
It seems like a lot at one time but in a way , the surprising thing is that it has taken so long . ""
Mirren , who is married to the American director Taylor Hackford , is the only actress to have played both Elizabeth I and II on screen .
Her portrayal of Elizabeth II in the 2006 film The Queen earned her a Bafta , a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for best actress .
Celebrating on Saturday in the company of her sister Kate and friends , , including Jeremy Irons , Mirren said she was "" thrilled and honoured "" .
"" I do n't think Prince William would agree to hand me the award if he thought I had blown it in terms of performing as his grandma , "" she said .
Previous Bafta fellows include Elizabeth Taylor , Anthony Hopkins , Judi Dench , Vanessa Redgrave and Martin Scorsese .
Mirren said she had written her acceptance speech without help .
"" Of course , is n't that what everyone does ? ""
she asked , admitting that with four Bafta wins , an Oscar , three Golden Globes and four Emmys she has had some practice .
"" I have gone through it with my husband , but just in outline .
I do n't want to go over it too much because it wo n't sound right .
"" I am also aware that it comes at the end of a long evening , when people are looking at their watches and thinking about the journey home . """
2014-02-18,"Do palace courtiers have a good eye for PR ?
This week Prince William and his brother "" bagged "" a few sandbags and waded the flooded upper reaches of the Thames .
This tour of royal duty presumably produced the desired effect â€ “ positive media reporting â€
“ no doubt resulting in much merriment among the corridors of the royal household .
On a roll , Prince William has called for all ivory artefacts to be removed from the royal palaces and destroyed .
Less merriment now .
Does his grandmother know about this ?
Surely such a statement will be anathema to the Duke of Edinburgh who will be muttering in William 's direction , and heading to the press office to remind them who 's in charge of this "" bloody place "" .
This follows the prince 's attendance at the World Wildlife symposium in London last week .
The hunting and slaughter of elephant and rhinoceros is no longer the sport of kings and the idle rich , with the exception of the Spanish royal family .
William has said that he "" is even more devoted to protecting these magnificent animals for future generations "" .
Yes , the shooting of elephants and rhino for personal gain is unacceptable â€ “ "" a trade that fuels the greed of international criminals "" as the Prince of Wales put it , and so we must applaud their royal highnesses for lending their royal weight to the cause .
However , Prince William and his brother were guests of the Duke of Westminster in Spain just days before to shoot wild boar and other animals not yet on the endangered list .
This led to inevitable cries of hypocrisy , forcing his image makers at Kensington Palace to release a statement underlining his passion for endangered wildlife .
The British royal family has for centuries shot game on privately owned estates throughout the land .
Hunting has historically been , and remains , an obsession .
While protection officer to the late Princess of Wales , I was present at most of the annual November shooting parties , hosted by Prince Charles at Sandringham House in Norfolk .
The post - breakfast gathering of guests , dressed in their hunting finery would meet front of house to witness the Prince of Wales assign the "" male gun "" position and partner for the day 's shooting .
A fleet of Range Rovers would be summoned and the shooting party driven to their places for the first shoot of the day .
At the same time , packed hampers and bottles of "" royal "" home made orange vodka , made from Seville oranges , courtesy of the king of Spain , would be despatched to a secluded log cabin by attentive valets and royal stewards , all sporting pristine thorn - proof apparel .
Loyal gamekeepers and hired - in beaters were packed off ahead of the shooting party in open - top tractors with a cauldron of vegetable soup and cracked mugs .
Whatever the weather , the beaters would drive the bred pheasants from their woodland home to a prepared unharvested patch of kale , just short of a high wooded copse .
Once the royal party was in position , the beaters would slash at the kale , and hundreds of birds would rise to scale the trees ahead , only to be blasted to the ground .
The sheer number of birds would blacken the sky , as they drifted to a slow death , many injured bouncing off of the roughly ploughed furrows , only to have their escape plan wrecked by excitable black royal labradors .
The royal shooting obsession was something Princess Diana found repugnant .
Requiring little or no skill , royal pheasant shoots are a pre - planned carnage of wildlife , bred specifically for slaughter .
From my experience , royal courtiers would have had prior knowledge of the Spanish visit .
Failing to advise against the wild boar shoot is symptomatic of the sycophantic culture that surround the royal princes .
If Prince William is to "" spearhead "" the global protection of wildlife , then he has to be consistent , particularly when he says : "" This year I have become even more devoted to protecting the resources of the Earth for not only my son , but also other children of his generation to enjoy . ""
Otherwise wild boar may not exist in 20 years ' time and Prince George will be reminding us of the fate of the pheasant and his devotion to protect the resources of the earth , until there is nothing left to protect ."
2014-02-19,"This article examines some of the arguments for and against destroying ivory as part of the wider global strategy to save African elephants .
When Kenya became the first country to destroy ivory stockpiles by burning them in 1989 , it was a hugely symbolic act that inspired the global ban in ivory trade the following year .
This demonstration of commitment by an African nation played a key role in galvanising largely successful efforts to control elephant poaching over the next decade .
Now that elephants are once again threatened , Williamâ€ ™ s initiative â€ “ if carried out â€ “ could help focus
the worldâ€ ™ s attention on the problem in a similar way .
The sight of arguably the worldâ€ ™ s most famous family destroying its ivory collection would have a tremendous impact .
Two arguments have been made against the idea .
The first objection is that it would be wrong to destroy works of art that are of beauty and cultural value .
However , in emergency situations , it is often necessary to destroy things of value in order to achieve a more important objective : the surgeon amputates a diseased limb to save the patient ; fire fighters cut down trees to contain a forest fire ; nature reserve managers cull a species that is threatening the integrity of the ecosystem .
Make no mistake : this is also an emergency .
Within a few years , African elephants may well be all but extinct in the wild if no effective action is taken .
So this first argument against destroying ivory only holds water if you believe that ivory artworks are more important than elephants .
But by destroying works of art you are not destroying the culture that made them , nor the living cultural tradition that they inspire .
If the African elephant becomes extinct it will be gone forever : the ecological , cultural , economic â€ “ and moral â€ “ loss to humanity would be incalculable .
The second argument is that destroying ivory would not help to save the elephants .
This argument has to be taken seriously .
The fact is that the complexity of the problem makes it hard to know whether any one action taken to resolve it will have the desired effect or not .
Development agencies working to save human populations threatened by war and famine describe these situations as â€œcomplex
emergenciesâ€ � .
They are complex because war , crime , hunger , disease and many other factors interact with each other in often unpredictable ways .
This means that agencies have to take difficult decisions in conditions that are highly uncertain .
They can not always be sure , for example , that aid sent in to feed the hungry will not end up being used to buy arms .
The situation of animals threatened by wildlife crime in Africa today is also a complex emergency .
The only difference is that the principal victims are not humans but animals .
( Although there are also human victims , just as the environment is also a victim in human complex emergencies . )
So there is a legitimate concern that destroying ivory will not have the desired effect , but rather serve to increase its value to criminals and thereby make poaching even more lucrative .
It is true that our knowledge of what is driving the increased demand for ivory , especially from China , is insufficient .
But the recent studies suggest that this fear is unfounded .
The demand comes mainly from the â€œtuhaoâ€ � , the wealthy middle class who are buying ivory as a long - term investment , just as they are also buying up huge quantities of gold .
Investors in China and elsewhere have to be persuaded that buying ivory is , firstly , morally wrong and , secondly , a bad investment .
Prince Williamâ€ ™ s proposal would contribute to both of these aims .
According to best - selling Kenyan author and environmentalist Kuki Gallman : If to make ivory undesirable by putting a stigma on possessing and exhibiting ivory objects - however refined and precious they may be - is the ultimate aim , so as to stop the market that drives the killing , I can not think of more powerful a gesture than destroying the royal ivory collection .
In the medium term the aim should be to shut down the ivory market completely , so that it becomes impossible to buy or sell ivory legally anywhere in the world .
To deter would - be investors , it is essential to send a clear signal that the ban on ivory trade is forever ; which is why it is so important that countries like Tanzania and Botswana that have announced temporary bans on ivory trade extend them and make them permanent .
This measure would not deter organise criminals of course , but it would discourage otherwise law - abiding citizens from investing their savings in ivory and result in a huge decrease in global demand .
So bring on the bonfire of royal ivory in front of Buckingham Palace .
Better still , why not give other UK institutions and ordinary citizens the chance to demonstrate their support by adding their own ivory to the pyre ?"
2014-02-20,"The jury in the phone - hacking trial has been directed to find Rebekah Brooks "" not guilty "" in relation to a charge that she unlawfully authorised payment to a public official for a photograph of Prince William in fancy dress .
It was ordered to do so by Mr Justice Saunders just before Brooks opened her defence on Thursday morning at the Old Bailey phone hacking trial .
He told jurors there was "" no case to answer "" in relation to count 4 , one of the five counts against Brooks . ""
There is no case to answer for Mrs Brooks â€ ¦
that 's the charge relating to the picture of Prince William in a bikini that was acquired by the Sun , "" said Saunders .
Saunders told the jury that he had made the decision as "" a matter of law "" and then told them to enter a not guilty verdict .
"" It 's for you to bring in a verdict of not guilty on that count now , "" he said .
The jury foreman was asked to stand up and formally make the not guilty finding .
The photo was taken when the Duke of Cambridge was at Sandhurst and Brooks was editor of the Sun .
Brooks still faces four of the five original charges including one other allegation relating to unlawful payments to public officials for stories when she was editor of the Sun .
She has pleaded not guilty to all charges which also include a conspiracy to hack phones and two charges alleging she obstructed the police investigating phone hacking by conspiring with her secretary and her husband , Charlie , to conceal material from Scotland Yard detectives .
Brooks has been on trial since October along with six others including David Cameron 's former spin doctor Andy Coulson , all of whom deny the charges .
Count 4 was one of two charges Brooks faced in relation to allegations of unlawful payments to public officials for stories .
In December the jury had been told by the prosecution that the former Sun editor approved an illegal Â£4,000 payment for a picture of the Duke of Cambridge at a fancy dress party dressed in a bikini as a Bond girl .
The court has been shown paperwork from the Sun purporting to show the payment was made in June 2006 when the prince was training at Sandhurst , the military academy .
According to an internal email at the Sun , Brooks was told the exclusive picture came from a reporter 's "" best contact at Sandhurst "" who wanted the cash to pay for his wife to go on a course , it was alleged .
In an email exchange , forwarded to Brooks by another journalist on the paper , the reporter said the source of the photo was "" an instructor at Sandhurst "" and the picture "" belongs to a fellow instructor "" who "" also happens to be William 's direct platoon commander "" .
The email revealed the person offering the photo demanded "" Â£4,000 up front "" and wanted the story to run during the Sandhurst summer holidays .
A story linked to this alleged payment appeared on 6 September 2006 but did not include the photo
â€ “ the paper ran instead a mock - up of the prince 's face on a man 's bikini - clad body under the headline ""
Willy in a bikini "" ."
2014-03-12,"Thereâ€ ™ s an anomaly in New Zealand public life : while weâ€ ™ re preparing to extinguish one of the last symbols of colonialism and dominion â€ “ the New Zealand flag â€ “
weâ€ ™ re simultaneously preparing to host the very representatives of colonialism and empire â€ “ Prince William and his royal family .
Put it down to the election year ; itâ€ ™ s doing strange things to a sane people .
In a speech at Victoria University of Wellington , prime minister John Key announced a referendum on the New Zealand flag will be held after the election .
The announcement was followed with confirmation from Labour and the Greens that , if elected , theyâ€ ™ ll honour the promise of a referendum .
Some commentators are dismissing the referendum as a cheap gimmick .
The idea was mooted a week before Treasury revealed tax revenues are down , and the deficit is higher than expected .
Keyâ€ ™ s government has woven its credibility to a patchwork of economic indicators and the budget surplus isnâ€ ™ t just one indicator , itâ€ ™ s the indicator .
Cynics might be forgiven for suspecting the flag debate is designed to take the wind out of Treasuryâ€ ™ s announcement .
After all , this is a government thatâ€ ™ s made an art of the political sidestep .
But it actually doesnâ€ ™ t matters whether the flag debate was intended to bury bad news or not .
A debate about the national identity doesnâ€ ™ t need reasons .
Flags are more than pretty patchworks .
Flags are symbols of identity .
New Zealandâ€ ™ s flag represents a country that no longer exists : the â€œBritain of the south Pacificâ€ � .
Although Britain exported her subjects , institutions and culture to New Zealand , she could never overcome geography .
New Zealand is part of the Pacific .
The New Zealand flag is the nexus between our colonial past and the national identity .
For almost a century the flag represented the national story : the Union Jack depicted home , while the Southern Cross spoke to our uprooted identity .
We were the British of the south Pacific .
But New Zealand society has changed rapidly over the past 20 years .
The MÄ � ori political movement is manifest , with the Treaty of Waitangi settlement process nearing its conclusion .
Auckland is home to over 200 ethnic groups and is considered more diverse than London or Sydney .
Open markets , relaxed regulations and proximity to emerging economies in Asia has transformed New Zealand from a protectionist agricultural economy â€ “ reliant on privileged access to Britain â€ “ to a globalised economy .
Indigenous rights , multiculturalism and economic reform : this is the infrastructure of change .
But the symbols of change havenâ€ ™ t caught up .
New Zealand is living separate realities : on the one hand weâ€ ™ re a multicultural nation rooted in the Pacific and increasingly reliant on Asia .
On the other hand weâ€ ™ re persisting with a flag that speaks to British colonisation and depicts a sort of statelessness .
Are we British or Kiwi ?
These are the contradictions of national identity .
Itâ€ ™ s tempting to think that Prince William , Catherine and Prince Georgeâ€ ™ s visit will be the last breath of the British Empire in New Zealand .
The argument goes that with a flag change New Zealanders will feel confident enough to ditch the monarchy .
I doubt that .
After all , the flag change itself isnâ€ ™ t guaranteed .
In a recent poll , 28 % of those who expressed an opinion wanted a new flag while 72 % preferred the status quo .
In a similar poll in 2004 , 42 % of respondents indicated they wanted a change .
Put the anomaly between the most recent poll and the 2004 poll down to the election year .
Itâ€ ™ s doing strange things to a usually sane people .
Reimaging and confirming our new national identity is so close , yet we seem determined to put it so far away ."
2014-03-21,"David Cameron believes the result of the 2018 World Cup bidding process was "" sorted "" in advance , with England 's bid team misled by Fifa executives who pledged support , then voted for rivals .
Cameron , whose comments coincide with Fifa executives meeting in Zurich to discuss the much - criticised process , told the Sun he had been left frustrated by the experience in 2010 , which he had previously described as "" murky "" .
Challenged by the paper 's guest editor , James Corden , to "" put your balls out there and say it was corrupt "" , Cameron replied : "" I would be very careful what I say â€
¦
It was a mad 24 hours of intensive lobbying which David Beckham and Prince William and I were doing together .
We thought we were making progress .
I think the whole thing was â€ ¦
You choose your words carefully .
I would say ' sorted ' before we went into it .
All I can tell you is there are a lot of people who promised they were going to vote for me .

Cameron 's remarks add to the pressure on Fifa to make serious headway with its investigation into the process which resulted in the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 tournaments to Russia and Qatar respectively .
Fifa confirmed on Thursday night that executives attending this week 's committee meeting would be interviewed by its ethics investigator , Michael Garcia , as part of his inquiry into the claims .
Thirteen members of the committee who made the decision in 2010 , including the president Sepp Blatter , remain in place , while nine have left .

2014-03-24,"Itâ€ ™ s been 25 years to the day since human error allowed the Exxon Valdez tanker to run aground in the pristine waters of Prince William Sound in the Gulf of Alaska , dumping 11 million gallons of crude oil in what would become the greatest environmental disaster for an entire generation .
Even after the recent Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico â€ ” a much larger accident in terms of the amount of oil released â€ ” the spectre of Exxon Valdez remains fresh in the minds of many Americans old enough to remember the wall - to - wall media coverage of crude - smothered rocks , birds , and marine mammals .
In the quarter century since the Exxon Valdez foundered , changing economic and climatic conditions have led to increased Arctic shipping , including increasing volumes of petroleum products through the Arctic .
Sadly , apart from a few areas around oil fields , there is little to no capacity to respond to an accident â€ “ leaving the regionâ€ ™ s coastal indigenous communities and iconic wildlife at risk of a catastrophe .
Local Alaskans and conservationists like myself â€ “ who witnessed the Exxon Valdez impact at close range â€ “ will never forget the damage .
The wake of oil spread far from Bligh Reef , devastating life in Prince William Sound , killing over a quarter of a million seabirds at the large colonies in neighbouring Cook Inlet , before moving along the coast of Kodiak and to a point on the Alaska Peninsula 460 miles to the south .
Yet more than memories remain .
Oil persists beneath the boulders and cobbles of the affected region , sea otters have only just recovered after 25 years , and some species such as Pacific herring and the fisheries reliant on them are still not recovering at all , despite Exxonâ€ ™ s overtly optimistic prediction of a quick and full recovery of Prince William Sound .
The fact is that even under ideal conditions , relatively little oil is actually recovered from a large spill .
Its long - term impacts demand that we redouble our efforts on prevention to protect natural resources and the communities that rely on them â€ “ particularly in the Arctic where the environmental challenges are greater , the response and cleanup infrastructure frequently poor , and the logistics for mounting a response in remote environments immense .
Furthermore , Arctic wildlife tends to aggregate in staggering numbers , rendering large portions of entire species vulnerable to a spill , like the seabirds of Cook Inlet .
Late last year , recognising that accidents will happen , I helped to lead a workshop with representatives of government agencies and coastal communities to address the lack of oil spill response capacity in the waterways separating Alaska in the United States from Chukotka in the Russian Federation .
Residents from the Bering and Anadyr Straits and other villages met with representatives from federal and state agencies and other organisations in order to better identify the best ways to understand , prepare for , and respond to , an oil spill in a co - ordinated manner .
While overall co - ordination of any large oil spill naturally rests with a formalised incident command , the first responders to a future oil spill in Arctic waters will more often than not be from the nearest local communities .
Local hunters possess knowledge of natural resources passed down over centuries , including the migratory movements of birds , marine mammals , and fish , as well as how to operate safely in their coastal waters .
These are the people who stand to lose the most in the event of a spill , which could devastate regional wildlife and fish populations .
Providing them the proper training , equipment , and infrastructure for their communities will help them to play a more meaningful role in planning for and safely responding to any future environmental disasters .
Communities , agencies , and other responsible groups on both sides of the political border must also establish predetermined roles and priorities .
For example , will oil be allowed to wash ashore or will an attempt at dispersal be made ?
While oil on Arctic beaches is nobodyâ€ ™ s wish , the long - term impacts of dispersant use on food security in the Arctic environment are unknown .
Both options have long - term environmental and human health consequences â€ “ and only through local input into the planning process can these difficult decisions be addressed .
During the Exxon Valdez incident , villages dependent on fishing were financially ruined .
A similar event farther north , impacting the health and abundance of marine mammal populations , could be even more devastating .
Such losses of iconic wildlife and damage to this stunning environment threaten not only a unique and precious part of our planet ; but also the nutritional needs of coastal communities and a critical component of their cultures .
In the end , the story of the Exxon Valdez remains a cautionary tale .
While simply hoping for the best may be the cheapest way forward given the resources required to establish functional networks of community and government bodies willing and able to work together , accidents do and will continue to happen .
If we are to secure the long - term health and security of the Arcticâ€ ™ s magnificent natural resources and vibrant indigenous cultures there can be little doubt concerning the value of both prevention and preparedness .

2014-03-31,"There has been some interesting debate recently about just how much celebrity star power genuinely benefits charities , with the high - profile parting of Scarlett Johansson and Oxfam prompting much soul - searching about the value of high - profile supporters .
Despite occasional hiccups , the fact remains that celebrity star power has enormous potential to widen the reach and appeal of an organisation 's messages .
The right person can help charities to raise their profile , boost funds and increase their influence â€ “ but only when the celebrity relationship is carefully planned , managed and sustained .
Finding a celebrity supporter is only part of the work .
The relationship then needs to be nurtured , the right opportunities need to be found and sensible safeguards need to be put in place .
Here are some tips for harnessing the power of celebrity for your cause .
Biggest is not always best When choosing a celebrity , resist the temptation to go straight to the biggest , most well - known names .
Instead , look for celebrities who have a link with or interest in your area of work â€ “ perhaps someone who has had experience of the issues your organisation is involved with , either directly or through a relative or friend .
Sometimes a less high - profile but dedicated supporter will take a greater interest and accomplish more for your charity than an A - list superstar .
They might also have fewer gatekeepers , more flexibility to fulfil short - notice requests and a shorter advanced - booking time .
Making contact The most important ingredient of a successful approach is clarity ; clarity about your organisation or campaign objectives , clarity about what you want the celebrity to do and clarity about the likely time commitment .
Without this , a celebrity or their agent will find it difficult to decide if they are able to make a commitment .
Consider mapping out your wishlist over a year so that your expectations are clear , and be realistic about the amount of time the celebrity will be able to give .
Celebrities are normally approached in one of two ways â€ “ directly , particularly if a charity has a staff member , trustee or other contact who is able to make an introduction , or , more commonly , through an agent .
Try to see the latter as a help rather than
a hindrance â€ “ working with him or her to understand the limitations on their client 's time and the best way to work with them .
Finding the right opportunities It can be useful to have several celebrity supporters from various walks of life who will appeal to a variety of media and audiences .
Rather than using one celebrity as a go - to person for every activity , find specific opportunities that are suited to their background , interests and talent .
A model may prefer a photocall ; an actor a radio appeal and so on .
Sustaining the relationship Celebrity supporters need to be nurtured , not just used .
They need to be looked after and on an organisation 's agenda for regular discussion .
Thoughtful gestures and regular communication can make all the difference â€ “ a newsletter with a personal note , a Christmas card and invitations to suitable events will all help to build and maintain a rapport .
When things go wrong
A celebrity relationship brings with it risks and well as rewards .
Celebrities are , by their nature , in the public eye and there is always the chance that they may attract negative attention .
Charities can minimise the potential reputational risks by keeping on top of developments and being prepared with responses for media , supporters and other important audiences at the first sign of any problems .
The above notwithstanding , keep a cool head and do n't fixate on poor publicity that is here today and gone tomorrow .
Even the most squeaky - clean celebrities will have their bad days â€ “ so do n't be too quick to distance yourself if they run into difficulties .
Measuring impact How you measure the impact of a celebrity 's support will depend on the nature of their contribution â€ “ for example whether they have spoken at an event or agreed to mention you in interviews â€ “ as well as your own internal reporting processes and performance targets .
If a celebrity has helped to generate media coverage , then standard PR measurements such as reach and advertising value equivalent can be used .
Celebrity support can also be measured as a gift in kind , so that if , for example , a high - profile person normally charges for speaking at an event and is doing the same for you , free of charge , then you can value this donation at the same level .

2014-04-07,"A gloomy , gusty Wellington morning on Monday threatened to disrupt the royal tour of New Zealand even before it had begun .
But despite predictions that the flight â€ “ carrying Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to New Zealand for their first formal tour with eight - month - old baby Prince George â€ “ would need to be diverted north , the Royal New Zealand Air Force jet was able to negotiate the famously wobbly descent into the capital .
Shortly after midday New Zealand time , Prince William , Catherine and George were greeted on the tarmac by the New Zealand prime minister , John Key , and the governor general , Sir Jerry Mateparae , beginning their 10-day tour with a drive around the Wellington bays and a formal welcome at Government House .
The duke and duchess were met by the governor - general , Sir Jerry Mateparae , New Zealand defence force bands , and the defence force kapa haka group , while eight - month - old baby George watched the proceedings from an upstairs window .
The Duchess of Cambridge wore a scarlet overcoat and hat , with a diamond fern brooch given to the Queen by the women of Auckland during her 1953 trip here .
Key later told reporters the duke and duchess were really pleased to be in New Zealand and he expected them to captivate the nation .
"" I do n't think their enthusiasm for coming to New Zealand has been dampened at all by the fact it was a little bit wet on the tarmac . ""
The immediate lead - up to the royal arrival came with a ripple of laughter at the expense of British media apparently suckered by belated April foolery from a so - called â€œMaori expertâ€ � .
A report published by the Daily Express over the weekend explained that female dancers taking part in the official powhiri , or Maori welcome , had agreed to break with their tradition of performing topless .
Men , meanwhile , typically wore nothing beneath their flax skirts , but â€œbecause of the high - profile guests theyâ€ ™ ll wear black undies to welcome them , â€ � reported the Express , quoting â€œMaori expert Tredegar Hallâ€ � .
During their stay in New Zealand , Prince William and Catherine would face a â€œminefield of customsâ€ � at marae , or traditional meeting place , the Express continued , including the ritual acceptance of a leaf .
â€œAccording to tradition , â€ � reported the paper , â€œif they pick the leaf up in the wrong way it could be deemed an act of war , with an international fall - out.â€ � London - based Hallâ€ ™ s tall tales , repeated but since deleted by the Telegraph website , went on to include the claim that the couple would be â€œoffered traditional food including a native bird , the kereru , which is on the verge of extinctionâ€ � .
The papers appeared to have fallen victim to a hoax , said Chris Finlayson , the minister for arts , culture and heritage and associate minister for Maori affairs .
â€œIt is an infantile prank at a time when Maori culture and New Zealand will be in the spotlight overseas , â€ � he said .
While he had not been intimately involved in the catering plans for the trip , Finlayson added , he could â€œguarantee no endangered wildlife will be servedâ€ � .
In the New Zealand press , the welcome was effusive .
The countryâ€ ™ s biggest selling paper , the Auckland - based New Zealand Herald , devoted its front page and five pages to the royal visitors in a â€œRoyal tour specialâ€ � .
Wellingtonâ€ ™ s Dominion Post announced , â€œWellington welcomes the Cambridgesâ€ � in huge type above a masthead which is itself a reminder of the nationâ€ ™ s constitutional ties to the United Kingdom .
A Herald editorial credited William and Catherine with â€œrevitalising the monarchyâ€ � .
â€œLike
Diana , they are making the monarchy less stuffy , more contemporary , and even Prince Charles appears to be more relaxed .
With three generations of heirs to the throne , the monarchy looks settled for another century .
It may live a long way from New Zealand but a family keeps the bond alive , â€ � said the paper .
The prime minister , John Key , agreed that the coupleâ€ ™ s performance had stayed any immediate prospect of changing New Zealandâ€ ™ s sovereign status .
While he remained of the view that New Zealand would â€œin all probabilityâ€ � become a republic at some point , he told Radio New Zealand on Monday morning , it was foreseeable only in â€œthe very long termâ€ � .
It was likely that Queen Elizabeth II would remain head of state â€œfor a very long time into the futureâ€ � .
Popular support for the monarchy , said Key , â€œspeaks volumes about the way that William and Kate , as young royals , have modernised the royal family and their place as the head of stateâ€ � .
The lobby group New Zealand Republic , however , marked the occasion with a new poll in which 66 % of those surveyed aged 18 - 30 said they would like to see a New Zealander as head of state .
Among all those polled , 44 % wanted a change , with 46 % preferring the status quo .
The couple will be based in the capital city , staying at the governor - generalâ€ ™ s residence , Government House , and flying around the country for day trips .
The visit , which has been widely compared with the 1983 visit by Prince Charles , Diana and baby Prince William , then nine months old , will see the royals attend numerous charity events , an aviation day with filmmaker Sir Peter Jackson , sailing on Auckland harbour , and the obligatory meetings with All Blacks .
The royal party depart New Zealand on 16 April for the Australian leg of their tour ."

2014-04-12,"Imagine this â€ “ Prince William emerges from the plane , on the couple 's royal arrival in New Zealand , and in his arms , he carries George , his baby son , an all- modern , hands on family man .
A day or so later , it 's not Kate who is commander - in - chief of playgroup manoeuvres , but the Windsor daddy , showing how it can be done .
On such an occasion , a photo opportunity or two can do more to shift public opinion than any number of earnest reports from think tanks urging papa to jump in the playpen not for play â€ “ heaven forbid - but for serious baby maintenance , the teething , the colic , and all that stuff .
We are in the midst of a bizarre twist to the fame game .
Gorgeous George wears a Â£70 plus pair of dungarees , not unlike his granddad wore at much the same age ( for some unknown reason the offspring of aristocrats and royalty , as a sign of true toffdom , are never permitted to stray far from a highly smocked , Peter Pan collar - style wardrobe , that was first designed back in the 1940s ) and we are told that half the country then gallops off to the nearest high class retailer to buy the exact same copy , not even a cut price rip off .
Do they really ?
Why ?
Still , if copying the Windsor offspring 's togs can be triggered merely by a change of outfit , think what might change if William could break with his family 's tradition and continue with that early promise he displayed , strapping a newborn George into his baby seat with some panache .
Traditionally , the royals , even the modern royals , seem a little absent - minded with their children , as if they forget that they are related .
Only to be gently reminded when they bump into each other , from time to time , for the royal family photo .
Nowadays that tends to mean arms â€œinformallyâ€ � around the shoulder .
Comfortable this is n't .
Certainly , the practical stuff is left to loyal retainers whom , unlike many of us , appear to be employed for life .
They do all the dirty work but at a price to the parents that they may not even value .
They never learn fluent baby talk , interpreting what their offspring likes , wants or hates , via the sheer slog of keeping a pre - speech child watered , fed and happy .
Kate seems to have acquired the lingo ; William in public at least looks as if he 's semaphoring the very old hat : â€œThis is women 's stuffâ€ � .
Instead , as the tour unfolds in all its sartorial elegance ( and I mean George not Kate ) , the next time he is permitted to make a public appearance , it would be a perfect opportunity for William to continue in his one man mission to convince the rest of us that there is a role for royalty in the 21st century .
As a republican who hankers to be a citizen not a subject , I am unconvinced .
But it might make a significant difference to the landscape of fatherhood , already changing fast , if it was William who did a bit more of the lifting and carrying , the chatting to other mothers and dads , the refereeing of baby punch ups and wiping the dribble .
You hope he might want to .
It 's time Windsor parenting was no longer semi - detached .

She has the best typecasting Did we miss anything ?"
2014-04-24,"Kirby Turnbull had been waiting weeks to flirt with Prince William .
And on a sunny Thursday morning in Canberra , the Black Mountain School student , who has cerebral palsy , got her opportunity when she met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at the National Arboretum .
As the duchess appeared in a green knee - length dress and accepted flowers , Turnbull gave William a silk tie made by her class and a scarf for Kate .
“
Thank you very much .
That ’s very kind , ” he said .
The 18-year - old giggled .
The girls’ pastoral care teacher , Sarah Desmond , said Turnbull had been up at 6 am laughing in anticipation and had been planning to tell the duke she likes flirting with boys , and him in particular .
“
She was really looking forward to his reaction , ” Desmond said .
The couple arrived about 10.30am and , helped by six - year - old twins Sebastian and Oliver Lye , planted an English oak tree .
“
Look at me , mum !
”
Sebastian yelled , watering the tree as his mother , Moira Lye , looked on laughing , but with occasional tears .
She had not expected the day to be so emotional .
Lye has been treated for breast cancer for the past three and half years and has just had her last course of chemotherapy .
The treatment is not getting anywhere , she says , so will meet her oncologist next week to discuss “ one last - ditch attempt
” .
Sebastian and Oliver are the youngest of the 41-year - old ’s five children and she was not sure how they were picked to help plant the tree .
“
It ’s been amazing , ” she said .
“
I certainly hope it is creating memories they will have for a very long time .
”
Lye said she had never been much of a monarchist and had watched the couple from afar for a few years .
“
Seeing them travel around Australia and how wonderful they have been has really opened my eyes , ” she said .
“
Hopefully they can have all the joy and love with their child that we have experienced with our children .
”
As Lye spoke the couple entered the playground where selected students were playing .
Three children on a set of swings barely glanced over as the couple entered the playground followed by a dozen cameras .
Sunday Roch , 11 , got an invitation and said she thought the duchess was pretty and , in an almost politician ’s manner , said it was a “ great opportunity ” to be able to meet them .
Asked what she would say to them , Roch replied : “ It is nice to meet you , your royal highnesses .
”
The couple will attend a reception at parliament house and will visit the National Portrait Gallery on the penultimate day of their tour in Australia ’s capital ."
2014-04-25,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have left Australian shores , wrapping up one of the most successful royal tours in the country 's history from a public relations perspective .
They flew out from Canberra on Friday afternoon with Prince George wriggling and squealing as they said farewell to a line - up that included the prime minister , Tony Abbott , the opposition leader , Bill Shorten , the governor general , Sir Peter Cosgrove , and the ACT chief minister , Katy Gallagher .
The duke and duchess turned and waved to the crowd of about 40 people that had gathered along the airport 's fence as about a dozen people finished loading their luggage , some of it monogrammed , into the back of the Royal Australian Air Force plane .
The duke and duchess were both still dressed in the clothes they had worn to the War Memorial earlier in the day and George was wearing a red sweater for the trip home .
His parents thanked the police who have escorted them on their trip before saying goodbye to the officials .
When the official greeting party , which also included Shortenâ€ ™ s stepson Rupert , lined up to wait for the royals , Shorten went and shook the hands of the workers on the tarmac behind them as about 50 members of Australian and international media looked on .
The Che Ferry family planned their school holiday around the event , taking a trip from Melbourne to Canberra to try to catch a glimpse of the royals , and were waiting at the airport .
Teresa , nine , held a bunch of flowers she was hoping to give the duchess and when asked what she liked about the couple , she said she just did .
"" I like them both equally , "" she said diplomatically .
Her mother , Janet , said she took Teresa to meet the Queen in the exact same spot when she was about 16 months old .
The family used to live in Canberra and said they knew it was the best place to try to see the couple because it was a "" small town "" .
The royal tour took in Manly beach in Sydney , Uluru , Adelaide , Brisbane and Canberra .
Kate and Williamâ€ ™ s last day was spent at a dawn service for Anzac Day followed by a memorial service at the National War Memorial .
The Duchess of Cambridge wore a poppy brooch which was given to her the night before by Emma Roberts - Smith , whose husband Ben is a recipient of the Victoria Cross .
Prince William wore a sprig of rosemary on his lapel , along with his diamond and golden jubilee medals , given to him for his service to the Queen and because he is a member of the royal family .
At the war memorial the Duke and Duchess laid a wreath at the stone of remembrance and placed floral tributes of rosemary and Australian native flowers on the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier after taking part in a memorial service .
In the tributes were wooden crosses with messages written by schoolchildren and the bouquet that the Duchess laid had a message which said : "" In every second of every day , you will be remembered for your courage and your bravery .
Thank you for your sacrifice and for what you have done for us .
For that , I am truly grateful .
"" The couple then planted a tree which had been cultivated from Lone Pine at Gallipoli .
In the prime ministerâ€ ™ s address to the memorial service , Abbott said Britain and Australia were family , though England is no longer regarded as the â€œmother countryâ€ � .
â€œYour presence reminds us of all our comrades in arms .
These are the ties that bind .
Lest we forget , â€ � he said ."
2014-04-30,"Andy Coulson has denied being told that MI5 was monitoring Prince William and Prince Harry 's phone calls , saying if this had been true it would have been a "" shocking "" story of interest to the Guardian as well as the News of the World .
The former NoW editor said it would have been far more interesting than a tale the jury at the phone - hacking trial has already heard about Palace police eating the Queen 's nuts .
He told jurors on Wednesday that he did not believe the claim allegedly made by his former royal editor Clive Goodman after his arrest for phone - hacking offences in August 2006 . ""
If Clive told me that the intelligence services were monitoring the telephone messages of Prince William , the young royals and the royal family , I would have found that to be an entirely shocking piece of information and I would have been interested in it as a potential story . ""
The idea that MI5 or MI6 were monitoring the royal family , storing messages would have been a shocking story of interest well beyond the Guardian . ""
Just the fact that it was happening would be a shocking story and one in which many newspapers
â€ “
the Guardian have a particular agenda in this area â€ “ broadcasters would be interested .
[ It would have been ] considerably more interesting than Her Majesty 's relationship with police over bowls of nuts , "" said Coulson .
He was being asked about a claim allegedly made by his former royal editor Clive Goodman that Mulcaire had introduced him to a "" serving spook "" who was "" eavesdropping "" on the royal family .
The claim was made in a note of a conversation the paper 's former managing editor Stuart Kuttner had had with Goodman after his arrest .
HIs note said : "" Glenn introduced CG [ Clive Goodman ] and a serving spook ... information leftover from secret service bugging . ""
"" Eavesdropping from info from secret services , I do n't know what this meant exactly .
"" Coulson was being questioned by his defence barrister , who is now re - examining his evidence following the completion of cross - examination by prosecutors .
He was in the witness box for the 10th day .
Coulson 's former PA , Belinda Sharrier , later testified that there was no safe in the editor 's office or no safe "" known as the editor 's safe "" at the News of the World .
Sharrier was being asked about the safe in relation to a claim earlier in the trial by the former NoW reporter Dan Evans that there was a "" legendary safe "" in the editor 's office or another colleague 's office where "" all sorts of stories were buried "" about the rich and famous .
The former PA testified that there were two safes in the paper - one in the managing editor 's office and one at the newsdesk .
She was also asked about Coulson 's diary entries around the time Evans had claimed jurors he had played a recording of a voicemail of Sienna Miller .
Coulson had claimed he was at the Labour party conference .
Sharrier confirmed entries in his diary for the 27 September 2005 and 28 September 2005 including the names "" Jack Straw , "" "" Tessa Jowell "" "" John Reid "" .
Sharrier described Coulson as "" amazing "" and "" brilliant , as a boss and a person "" .
She said she could n't be "" 100 % "" sure if he had attended the Labour party meetings scheduled .
"" It 's nine years ago , I ca n't absolutely guarantee 100 % , I do n't think anybody could , "" she added .
Under cross - examination she was also asked about a request by Coulson to print out emails from his draft folder "" very discreetly "" a week before Goodman was going to plead guilty in November 2006 .
She told jurors that from memory the drafts were "" speeches , budgets and general info "" of which she could remember two .
One of these , lead prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said , did not fall into these categories and was about the "" dark arts "" and the launch of a training programme , a "" school of excellence "" at the paper .
"" Why did n't you mention this kind of thing ? ""
Edis asked . ""
Because it did n't spring to mind , "" said Sharrier .
Edis asked : "" This great scandal [ phone hacking ] working its way out that autumn , but the only time in your life you were asked to go into the boss 's draft emails and you print them out very discreetly , would you not say that was odd ? ""
Sharrier replied : "" I did n't think it was odd . ""
Edis asked : "" You are fairly fond of and clearly admire him , is the evidence you have given actually true ? ""
Sharrier replied : "" Yes , it is . ""
She was also asked why she had said she did n't know about cash payments at the paper when paperwork showed that she had been involved in a payment request for a showbusiness columnist on the paper .
Sharrier said the columnist might have been busy and she "" would have written it out for him "" .
Conal Austin , a paediatric surgeon from Guy 's and St Thomas 's children 's hospital , a friend of Coulson 's , described the journalist as an "" altruistic "" person who was in no way "" underhand "" or "" deceitful "" .
Austin , who was appearing as a character witness , said they became good friends after their respective wives got to know each other at the school gates .
He had known him for 16 years and told how he had helped a charity he had set up in Sri Lanka for children in a personal capacity and as News of the World editor .
Austin said : "" I 've known Andy for many years , he is very personable , he 's quiet , not brash or not boastful in any way
â€
¦
I found him to be a mover and shaker , well connected .
He is a very nice chap , not someone who is underhand or deceitful . ""
Coulson has been charged with committing three criminal offences including one conspiracy to hack phones .
He denies all the charges .
Kuttner has been charged with conspiracy to hack phones , which he denies .
The trial continues ."
2014-05-14,"Kate Middleton was hacked 155 times by a reporter on the News of the World who said he snooped on her voicemails on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day , the Old Bailey has heard .
Clive Goodman , the paper 's former royal editor , also revealed for the first time he directly hacked the phone of Prince William , adding that police had failed to ask him a single question about it in the eight years since he was arrested on related charges .
He told jurors he hacked Prince William 35 times , Prince Harry nine times and the Duchess of Cambridge 155 times .
Goodman said he had not been asked about this by the police or any other authority when he was arrested on related charges in 2006 or any time since .
"" I 've never been asked before .
The Metropolitan police , Crown Prosecution Service did not ask me these questions in 2006 and 2007 .
I 've never been asked by any inquiry any time about this , "" he said .
He first hacked Middleton on 21 December 2005 , the jury heard , and continued to hack her on Christmas Eve , Christmas Day and Boxing Day .
His first hack of Prince William was revealed to have taken place at the end of January 2006 .
Goodman told jurors : "" I 'm really not the slightest bit proud of this .
I do n't want anyone to think I 'm not ashamed . ""
He also hacked the phone of Kate Waddington , the personal assistant to Sarah Ferguson , the Duchess of York , 160 times .
Goodman also said of Glenn Mulcaire , who was also arrested in 2006 for hacking members of the royal household : "" Virtually every story in the paper was ground through the Glenn Mulcaire mill . ""
Under cross - examination by Timothy Langdale QC , who is acting for the paper 's former editor Andy Coulson , Goodman told the jury that he was not on trial for hacking and the prosecution had told him he faced no further charges on this offence .
Turning to Langdale , he said : "" Now that you are asking them [ the questions ] , I 'm quite happy to get them out there and get everything in the open . ""
He said he was being as "" honest and open "" as he could be on the subject .
"" My entire life has been exposed .
I 've never been asked these questions ...
Anyone who wants to ask me questions , they will get straight answers as indeed you are getting today . ""
He told jurors that Middleton , who was dating Prince William , back in 2005 was a "" figure of increasing importance around the royal family .
There were discussions of her and Prince William marrying , moving in , settling down .
She had started receiving royal status around the royal family . ""
Langdale put it to him that "" one of the things you must have been worried about more than anything else in 2006 "" was that it would be discovered he was hacking Princes William and Harry and Kate Middleton .
He denied this and said his biggest fear was that he would have to carry the can for all the activities of Mulcaire who was arrested and jailed along with Goodman in January 2007 for hacking - related offences .
"" I was terrified of the whole thing .
I was more frightened of being blamed for Glenn Mulcaire 's hacking , "" he said .
Jurors have previously heard that Kate Middleton and Prince Harry had been hacked .
They have also seen emails relating to alleged hacks of Prince William when he was at Sandhurst in 2006 , but Goodman 's evidence on Wednesday is the first time it has been admitted .
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have known each other since 2001 when they met at St Andrew 's University and were exposed by the newspapers as a couple in 2004 .
The trial has already heard that personal messages left by Prince William for Kate Middleton in 2006 in which he called her "" babykins "" were hacked by the News of the World .
Goodman was jailed in 2005 after admitting being involved in the hacking of three royal aides , Prince Charles 's communication secretary Paddy Harverson , the prince 's aide , Helen Asprey , and Jamie Lowther - Pinkerton , private secretary to Princes William and Harry .
He was back in the witness box after an eight - week absence due to illness to finish his evidence .
Because of the long lapse of time between the first part of his cross - examination , the judge opened proceedings by refreshing the jury 's memory as to Goodman 's previous evidence .
Jurors were reminded that Goodman had claimed that Coulson had told him to tell police he was acting as a "" lone wolf "" and that he had gone "" off the reservation "" when asked about his activities in 2006 .
Coulson has been charged with one hacking conspiracy , a charge he denies .
The trial continues ."
2014-05-15,"Police did not want the full extent of hacking including that of Kate Middleton and Prince William known publicly because they wanted to protect the News of the World 's "" victims "" , it was claimed at an Old Bailey trial .
Clive Goodman , the paper 's former royal editor who yesterday admitted hacking Middleton 155 times , said that he has been "" completely open , honest and frank about phone hacking "" .
But , he told jurors , it was only because of questions in the present questions in the hacking trial , that he had named those he personally hacked . ""
What I had done I had admitted to and paid an extremely high price for it , "" he told jurors , reminding them he was jailed for hacking offences in 2007 .
Compared with a senior journalist on the paper , Goodman had said he was just a "" spear carrier "" rather than the "" five act opera "" of hacking .
He repeated an allegation he made on Wednesday that most major stories in the News of the World came from hacking .
"" There was not a single significant story broken at the NoW in the last couple of years "" that the senior journalist had not got from hacked voicemails , he said .
Goodman was jailed and dismissed in 2007 after he pleaded guilty to hacking three royal aides .
He was confronted about his hacking of Middleton , Prince William and Prince Harry for the first time on Wednesday during cross - examination by counsel for Andy Coulson , his then editor .
Goodman replied : "" As I said yesterday I have been completely open and honest about the extent of phone hacking . ""
The reason these things did not come into the public domain before was the police and CPS in 2006 , 2007 decided they were not going to publish things to protect the discretion of the victims . ""
The only reason they came up now is they were not out there in the public domain at the time . ""
He went on : "" Whatever I have been accused of I have admitted to and paid an extremely high price for it . ""
He has not been charged with hacking as part of the current trial but has been charged with two offences of conspiring to cause misconduct in public office by paying palace police for royal phone directories .
He denies the charges .
Timothy Langdale QC , for Coulson , asked Goodman about a meeting he had following his imprisonment about his dismissal from the paper .
Langdale asked why he omitted information on his own hacking . ""
Were you concerned not to tell them the full extent of your hacking ? ""
Langdale asked .
He added : "" The one thing you were not going to tell them was the extent of your activities . ""
Goodman denied this and said the information was not relevant as the terms of the meeting related to the alleged knowledge Coulson and had about hacking .
He said when he appealed against his dismissal when he got out of jail , he wanted others to "" admit their responsibility "" .
Langdale put it to him that after his arrest "" you 've built up an increasing body of resentment which you did not possess at the time "" .
Goodman denied this was the case .
He has previously testified that Coulson was a friend but when he became editor of the paper in 2003 he became aggressive and bullying , which Coulson has denied .
Goodman told jurors that Coulson had kicked a desk when he told him he could n't go on a job to America because of child care .
He also said he felt "" pretty much out of a job "" when he was told another reporter would be going on the US royal tour and that he would be covering the young royals .
Coulson has been charged with conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office and conspiring to hack phones .
He denies all charges .
Langdale challenged Goodman about an email he had sent to his sister complaining after being challenged by the deputy managing editor about cash payments to his sources .
"" I feel like peeling his face right off his skull , "" he had said .
"" More resentment building up ? "" asked Langdale .
Goodman denied this was case , saying he was more "" frustrated "" with the executive . ""
Is it correct Mr Goodman that you just resent any criticism of you at all , "" Langdale asked . ""
No , not at all , "" Goodman replied , adding "" When you get things wrong you just take it on the chin . ""
The trial continues ."
2014-05-19,"The royal family has been "" embarrassed "" by revelations that the News of the World had frequently hacked the phones of Prince William and Kate Middleton , it has been claimed at the Old Bailey .
Clive Goodman , the former royal editor at the paper , said the police and the Crown Prosecution Service had known he had hacked their phones in 2006 when he was first arrested
but they had decided to "" ringfence "" the royals
so they would n't have to be part of a public trial .
He was convicted of hacking three royal aides â€ “ Helen Asprey , Jamie Lowther - Pinkerton and Paddy Harverson â€ “ in 2006 but his hacking of the princes and William 's then girlfriend only emerged last week in the phone - hacking trial .
"" The police knew about the hacking of Prince William and Prince Harry , the CPS knew , and they were the ones that chose they wanted to ringfence the enquiry so they did n't embarrass members of the royal family . ""
Those members of the royal family have been embarrassed by this trial , "" Goodman said .
Goodman is not on trial for hacking but for an offence related to the trial centring on payments to public officials for a confidential royal phone directory .
The lead prosecutor , Andrew Edis QC , accused Goodman of only confessing to hacking the royal princes and Kate Middleton after receiving guarantees that he would not face further prosecution .
Last week he revealed that he had hacked Kate Middleton 155 times , Prince William 35 times and Prince Harry nine times .
Goodman denied he had only confessed to the extra hacking once he had been cleared of future prosecution . ""
All I could do was answer the questions put to me , "" he said of the cross - examination last week which drew him on the hacking of the royals .
Edis said "" it can not be true that you did not remember hacking William "" , whom he described as was "" one of the most protected targets in the country "" .
He reminded him that he had previously testified that he could not recall specific hacking targets beyond those involved in his 2006 conviction .
Goodman said "" it was n't a lie "" when he told the jury that he did n't recall hacking the Duke of Cambridge .
Edis put it to him that he only admitted to the additional hacking after being "" freed up "" by the CPS . ""
After you said you could n't remember , the Crown Prosecution Service was asked to make clear whether you were at risk of prosecution for phone hacking in yet another trial in the future , "" he said .
"" They said there was n't going to be another trial into phone hacking involving you . ""
This freed you up , and you told the truth . ""
Goodman told the court that he was under "" pressure "" under cross - examination in March and had been ill at the time .
He reminded the jury he had been absent from the trial for two months with heart problems and two bouts of pneumonia .
He said it was unfair to characterise his earlier response about Prince William as a lie .
"" I was under a lot of pressure , and I did n't know what the purpose of the questioning was , "" he said .
"" I am not on trial for phone hacking , and everyone keeps asking me about phone hacking .
"" I was quite ill at the time , I had a heart operation ,
I was back in hospital , I had a further heart condition , suffered pneumonia twice , he said .
' I think it is unfair to say I got things confused when I did n't . '
Edis accused Goodman of hiding the hacking in 2007 during his unfair dismissal claim against News International to avoid incriminating himself .
Goodman claims editor Andy Coulson knew about some of the hacking , but said he did n't think he knew about the hacking of the princes .
He said he did n't owe Coulson any "" favours "" but he was "" also not going to make up stuff "" about his former editor who has been charged with conspiring to hack phones .
He admitted he was "" astonished "" when convicted hacker Glenn Mulcaire with whom he worked , obtained the direct voicemail number for Kate Middleton and Prince William .
He said Mulcaire obtained them as a "" flourishes "" .
They were "" very difficult targets "" and he wanted to "" show off that he could do it "" .
Goodman has admitted sending emails to Coulson and others about police sources but denies he ever paid officers or that he had such sources .
He told Edis that if he had read Elizabeth Filkin 's report on police and journalists he would know that "" police contact "" was the "" most misused phrase in newspapers "" .
Goodman said it was acceptable to exaggerate sources and was "" the journalist equivalent of ' the cheque 's in the post ' . ""
He said his claims to have had police sources was "" a sales technique , to get a story in the paper "" .
Goodman and Coulson deny all charges against them .
The trial continues ."
2014-05-27,"The Duchess of Cambridge deserved privacy just like anyone else when she was dating Prince William , a jury at the Old Bailey has heard .
The former News of the World royal editor forfeited his chance of sympathy from the jury in the phone - hacking trial after his "" shameful "" admission that he hacked Kate Middleton 's phone 155 times , his lawyer said .
David Spens QC said Clive Goodman had "" recognised "" that his standards of journalism had fallen below those expected of him and was not proud of what he had done .
"" I am not inviting any sympathy for Mr Goodman .
Any sympathy for him has been forfeited by his admission that he hacked Kate Middleton , Prince William and Prince Harry , which was a shameful thing to do , "" said Spens .
"" It 's all to do with maintaining high standards of journalism â€ “ respecting anyone 's right to privacy , not just Kate Middleton . ""
Mr Goodman had recognised he had fallen below those standards , "" he added .
The jury has previously heard Goodman started hacking her phone in December 2005 and had even eavesdropped on her voicemails on Christmas Day and Boxing Day of that year .
In his closing speech Spens reminded jurors that Goodman had not been jailed for hacking royal aides in 2007 and that he was not now on trial for this "" extra hacking "" .
Spens told them Goodman was given a guarantee on 11 May 2014 , midway through his trial , that he would not be charged over Middleton and the princes and invited them to consider why he had held this "" shameful "" episode of hacking from the court until three days after received this assurance .
They would have to consider if it was "" a white lie "" or "" a really serious lie "" , he said .
Spens suggested that he held this back "" because he was fearful of being charged "" and after being released from jail in 2007 he had had no reason to believe he would ever be charged with hacking again . ""
He was falsely stigmatised as a single rogue reporter ...
He had put hacking , and the directories and the News of the World behind him and he was leading a wholly new life , principally as primary carer for his daughter born in 2005 , minding his own business and getting on with his life ... then came the knock on the door , "" said Spens .
Spens challenged the evidence of Coulson and that of the paper 's former managing editor Stuart Kuttner about their response to his arrest in 2006 .
""
Do they remind you of the three wise monkeys , see no evil , hear no evil , speak no evil ? ""
Spens asked .
He accused Coulson of "" skulduggery "" and , separately , said Kuttner 's claim he wanted to put a supporting company arm around Goodman after his arrest was a "" charade "" .
He went to visit him "" to pump him for information "" about the police 's investigation , said Spens .
Spens said Goodman did not think he would be back in court in relation to 15 internal royal phone directories that were found in his home during the police searches in 2006 . ""
That whole chapter of his life was over , "" he said .
Goodman has been charged with conspiring to cause misconduct in public office after a second police inquiry , Operation Weeting into hacking , was opened in 2011 .
The Crown Prosecution Service brought the charges after Weeting detectives found emails from Goodman to the paper 's editor Andy Coulson asking for money to pay a palace police officer for the royal phone books .
Spens said the charges related to something that was "" no more than a storm in a teacup "" and were based on exaggeration by Goodman in his emails to his boss .
Goodman has said he did not have any police contacts and that he only pretended he did to make sure his real contacts
â€ “ one of them a journalist on another paper - would be paid .
Two types of books were found at Goodman 's home â€ “ "" green books "" and internal telephone directories
â€ “
but none had come from police , Spens said .
The green book was described as "" a sort of posher version "" of the royal internal telephone directory because it contained the telephone numbers of officials such as the chief pilot of the royal helicopter and the Queen 's racing adviser .
Spens told jurors that only one green book was delivered to royal protection officers at St James 's Palace but there was never any report that it had gone missing . ""
That may tell you this book did not come from a St James 's Palace police officer , "" said Spens .
He also told jurors that the content of the directories , while helpful to Goodman , were not that sensitive and his own claim that one of the books contained the direct line to the Queen was untrue . ""
He was exaggerating , no doubt about that , "" said Spens .
"" All you find in the green book are just switchboard numbers . ""
He said "" exhaustive efforts "" were made in 2012 by police who were "" perhaps wishing to atone for that superficial inquiry "" in 2006 when Goodman was first arrested on suspicion of hacking into the voicemail of royal aides .
The police had left "" no stone unturned "" in their quest to find a corrupt police officer who might have been responsible for selling the royal books , but none was found .
Operation Weeting officers had found 112 unidentified fingerprints on the 15 books found in Goodman 's home and could not match any of them with royal police officers .
He said there was "" no forensic link "" â€ “ no fingerprints , banking records or telephone records â€ “ between Goodman and police .
Goodman and Coulson and their five co - defendants deny all charges against them .
The trial continues ."
2014-06-09,"David Beckham and Prince William launched a campaign to help stigmatise the buying of ivory and rhino horn on Monday .
"" Our children should not live in a world without elephants , tigers , lions and rhinos .
Enough is enough , "" said Prince William , who convened the United for Wildlife group , a coalition of global conservation groups .
"" It is time to choose between critically endangered species and the criminals who kill them for money . ""
The sports - themed slogan â€ “ "" # WhoseSideAreYouOn "" â€ “ aims to highlight the slaughter of tens of thousands of animals a year that feeds the illegal trade .
It is supported by a host of star names , including Andy Murray , Lewis Hamilton , Rahul Dravid , rugby world cup winner Francois Pienaar and basketball superstar Yao Ming , whose campaign against shark finning is credited with slashing consumption in China .
The United for Wildlife campaign set out its commitment to improve enforcement in February , and Monday 's initiative is aimed at increasing public pressure on the consumers of ivory and other illegal wildlife products .
"" We knew we needed to do more to bring the illegal wildlife trade into the open , "" said Prince William .
"" It thrives because it is hidden , often invisible , making it easy for criminals to expand their violent greed .
We wanted to find a way to show the world what was happening . ""
The slaughter of elephants , rhinos , tigers and other species has surged in the last decade , driven by a lucrative illicit trade estimated to be worth $ 5 - 20bn a year .
Only drugs , people and arms trafficking earn more for criminals .
More than 1,000 rangers have been killed in the last decade and the corruption and violence accompanying wildlife crime takes a heavy toll on local communities .
More than 22,000 African elephants were killed in 2012 for their ivory , from a population of about 500,000 .
Rhinos have been even harder hit , with 1,004 poached in South Africa in 2013 compared to just 13 in 2007 .
Tiger numbers have plunged by more than 97 % in the last century .
Lead ambassador Beckham said he was "" passionate "" about the cause .
"" It really is devastating and we are in a world where our generation and the younger generation really can make a difference and we need to do it now , "" he said .
"" Are we on the side of the criminals or are we one the side of the animals ? ""
Emmanuel de Merode , director of the Virunga national park in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) , was shot by poachers in April but survived .
Attending the event in London , he said : "" This effort to combat wildlife crime is not just about conservation , you have to picture wildlife crime in the damage overall that is being done to people 's natural resources .
In DRC there is no more extreme example , because it has provoked a war that has seen the death of over 6 million innocent people . ""
De Merode has seen 130 of his rangers murdered in a decade , as well as massacres of the mountain gorillas for which Virunga is famous .
It was also home to the world 's largest population of hippos in the world , but just 350 of the 27,000 have survived .
"" This is a war driven by the illegal exploitation of natural resources of which wildlife crime is a part , "" he said .
"" We are not just looking after wildlife , we are looking after people too . ""
Peter Knights , executive director of WildAid , said campaigns targeting public opinion can be very effective but only if they reach the audiences in the key consuming countries , of which China is the largest .
More than 100 million sharks were being killed every year , but the eating of shark fin soup in China has fallen by 50 - 70 % in the least two years , coinciding with a media campaign fronted by Yao Ming and the banning of the high - status dish from official state dinners .
Knights said attacking the demand for the products of the wildlife trade was crucial , not just fighting to cut the supply with improved enforcement .
"" They have been doing the on - the - ground stuff for years .
But it 's like the drugs trade : you can put trillions of dollars into enforcement but if you the demand is still there you will not solve the problem . ""
"" Unless the demand stops , the killing will continue , "" said M. Sanjayan , senior scientist at Conservation International .
"" You have to make it unfashionable and who should you get to make it unfashionable ?
The fashion icons of the world . ""
Knights said recent moves against the ivory trade in China were encouraging , including three key retailers taking ivory off their shelves , a series of high - profile destructions of ivory stockpiles and tough new penalties of up to 10 years in jail for wildlife crime ."

Report one :
Daily Mail , Saturday , 21 June , page 5 , by Rebecca English : "" The cost to taxpayers of refurbishing the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge 's Kensington Palace apartment has quadrupled â€ “ to Â£4 m .
Building work on the 22-plus room home has soared by Â£3 m in the last year and includes the bill for William and Kate 's new kitchen and several bathrooms , the Mail can reveal .
The vast project has seen Apartment 1A , which had been used as office space since the death of Princess Margaret , transformed into a ' family home ' .
Although the couple are personally paying for all fixtures and fittings like curtains , carpets and furniture , the cost of building their new bedroom and even Prince George 's nursery has come from the public purse .
One courtier last night insisted that the Kensington Palace project actually offered taxpayers ' great value ' given the state of the crumbling apartment .
But questions will be asked as to whether Buckingham Palace , which has forked out for the refurbishment , is spending public money wisely . ""
Report two :
Mail on Sunday , Sunday , 22 June , page 21 , by Charlotte Griffiths :
"" When the cost of refurbishing their magnificent home at Kensington Palace threatened to spiral out of control , there was only one course of action for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge â€ “ turn to the ' Bank of Dad ' .
I can reveal that Prince Charles agreed to foot the Â£1.5 m cost of fitting out the couple 's cavernous Apartment 1A with curtains , carpets and furniture â€ “ meaning that thanks to his generosity , the overall bill for work at the Palace is Â£5.5 m .
One of the biggest expenses was renovating the main kitchen , according to sources .
I 'm told the bill was a staggering Â£170,000 , and although taxpayers paid for structural work , Charles paid for the rest ...
Taxpayers have footed the Â£4 m structural repair bill for the four - storey apartment , which used to be the home of Princess Margaret and was later used as offices .
It was last refurbished in 1963 and needed to be virtually gutted before it could be made habitable .
Removing asbestos from the Sir Christopher Wren - designed building cost Â£500,000 , while renewal of the roof cost a further Â£400,000 .
The bill for rewiring , plumbing and other structural work was Â£1 m , and the remaining Â£2 m went on replacing floorboards , and repairing walls in the 22-room apartment , which will accommodate William , Kate and their baby son George .
A spokesman for Prince Charles said William and Kate ' were at pains to ensure that the specification is not extravagant ' .
"" It 's a small lesson in newspaper spin .
Daily Mail negative versus Mail on Sunday positive .
Republicans will doubtless point out that the end result is the same : oodles of public money spent on the most privileged family in the land .
And they may also be forgiven for wondering whether the Daily Mail is their new best friend ."

The announcement confirms rumours rife since the duke ended active service as an RAF search and rescue pilot in September last year .
The full - time role , for which he will donate his salary to charity , will be fitted in around royal duties .
He will sign an employment contract with a civilian employer ( Bond Air Services ) and is believed to be the first member of the royal family in direct succession to do so .
The job is convenient for the Cambridges ' new country home , Anmer Hall , a Grade II - listed 10-bedroom mansion on the Queen 's Sandringham estate , recently privately refurbished to accommodate the duke and duchess and Prince George .
While in London , the couple will reside at their 21-room apartment at Kensington Palace , recently refurbished at a cost of Â£4.5 m to the public purse .
A Kensington Palace spokesman said William , 32 , was "" very much looking forward to "" the next step in his career .
The EAAA operates two helicopters and employs three pilots in Norwich and three in Cambridge , covering Norfolk , Suffolk , Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire .
Along with a pilot , each helicopter carries a doctor and a paramedic .
William 's main duties will involve flying an EC145 T2 aircraft , working alongside medics to respond to emergencies ranging from road accidents to heart attacks .
Patrick Peal , chief executive of the EAAA , said the organisation would benefit both from William 's skills as a pilot and from a boost to the charity 's profile .
"" We 're very fortunate that we currently enjoy tremendous levels of support , but fundraising is always a challenge
â€
“
we 're looking to raise Â£7.5 m a year to continue the lifesaving work â€
“
and I 'm sure that this will help to raise the profile of the charity .
We 're looking forward to him being part of the team , "" he said .
Alastair Wilson , the charity 's medical director , said he felt the duke was well - suited to the role . ""
Compared to his role as a search and rescue pilot , he may be dealing with more injury patients than he is used to , but I 'm sure he will adapt very well to that . ""
Before beginning the job , William will be required to gain an air transport pilot licence to complement his military training , and to undergo training specific to his new role .
In order to gain the licence , he must complete five months of training followed by 14 exams and a flight test .
Initially he will be employed as a co - pilot , but after a period of training he will be qualified as a helicopter commander .
A palace spokesman said : "" The job will build on the duke 's operational experience in the Royal Air Force search and rescue force .
During this time he undertook more than 150 search and rescue operations .
"" This year William completed a 10-week bespoke agricultural course at the University of Cambridge designed to help him run the Duchy of Cornwall , which he will inherit and which will provide a generous income for him on becoming Prince of Wales ."
2014-08-10,"After a Â£4.5 m refit to his London Kensington pad and a meagre Â£1.5 m touch - up to Anmer Hall ( his wedding gift from the Queen ) , Prince William â€ “ with royal duties on the slide , and possibly a guilt complex to boot â€ “ has volunteered his services as an air ambulance helicopter pilot , free of charge , with the salary going to charity .
What next ?
Will Prince Harry buy out his mate Guy Pelly and open up Londonâ€ ™ s aristo nightclub taverns , with free entrance and booze for the underprivileged , packing the revellers off with free food parcels for their journey home ? .
I can imagine Williamâ€ ™ s father wandering aimlessly in the darkened corridors at Clarence House , with a furrowed brow , shouting towards his duchess in a nearby room â€ “
â€œBut why ?
â€
¦
â€ � â€œPhilanthropy , â€ � comes a muffled reply ,
â€œyour sisterâ€ ™ s the bloody patron.â€
�
Good one , Camilla .
And indeed , a good word â€ “
but it ainâ€ ™ t going to work .
Williamâ€ ™ s new job is the latest PR stunt from the royal advisers , coupled with the princeâ€ ™ s own quest to be seen to be â€œnormalâ€ � .
But to take the controls of an air ambulance hovering above a busy street and then land to evacuate your patient to hospital is , I suggest , a task far from normal .
This type of incident , uncommon in daily life , attracts crowds , and upon learning that Chopper Wales is at the controls , the risk of onlookers in search of the perfect selfie could seriously jeopardise a safe takeoff .
Williamâ€ ™ s late mother Diana , Princess of Wales , was always in search of a moment to be â€œnormalâ€ � .
I recall her requesting that we travel normally to France .
When questioned as to what she meant , she replied â€œWe donâ€ ™ t need special services or VIP waiting rooms .
Let us queue with normal people.â€ �
She reluctantly cancelled her hair appointment so we could get to Gatwick on time , but nevertheless insisted we travel with chauffeur to the airport .
Within minutes of us both standing in the check - in line , we were surrounded by a group of semi - inebriated hen - party travellers bound for Mallorca .
For seconds Diana was amused , until uniformed security arrived and representatives of British Airways , completely bemused as to why Diana had chosen this method of checking in , led us to the safety of the VIP lounge .
Apart from burger and chips with William and Harry at Bill Wymanâ€ ™ s Sticky Fingers restaurant in Kensington , the quest for normality died at Gatwick .
William and his wife , with brother Harry , have all declared their â€œbrandâ€ � , and brands need feeding .
Once again , it seems , the sycophantic corps of advisers they employ has not properly researched Williamâ€ ™ s I - want - to be - normal idea .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s a marvellous idea , Your Royal Highness , the public will love it ,
â€ � was almost certainly the reaction he expected , and the one they supplied .
With rare exceptions , members of royalty always do what they want .
William would not for one royal moment have thought that â€œflying for freeâ€ � above the Norfolk countryside rescuing the injured serfs below was even worthy of a constructive comment .
His thinking will have gone : â€œI am a future king , and can help the people .
Whatâ€ ™ s better than that?â€ �
He will have failed to observe the age of his grandparents , and indeed of his own father , and the clear message from the Queen : â€œWe are getting old â€ “ your time has come.â€ �
Leave these specialist posts to the experts .
Prince Charles , after leaving his ship , Bronington , didnâ€ ™ t make any overtures to become the coxswain of the Cromer lifeboat .
The Queen , with her wartime attachment in the army , made no serious requests to become the curator of the Army Transport Museum after her accession to the throne .
William , his wife and his brother are experts in the field of royalty , and however much they display their loom bands , they are not normal .
He should listen to his grandmother , get out there , use his position and raise money for his charities in a royal way â€ “ and not rely on stunts seemingly encouraged by sycophants ."

2014-10-08,"The visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to Australia in April cost the taxpayer $ 474,137 , newly released figures show .
Much of this bill â€ “ $ 251,338 â€ “ was taken up by transport , with the RAAF flying the royal couple to Australia from New Zealand and then taking them to engagements across Australia , including Brisbane , Adelaide and Uluru .
A further $ 73,638 was spent on Prince William and Catherineâ€ ™ s â€œdomestic travelâ€ � , which included meals and accommodation .
Media liaison cost $ 85,366 while hospitality amounted to $ 59,486 .
The rest was made up of â€œmiscellaneous visit costsâ€ � .
Security costs , which would have been significant , are not included in the figures , which were released under freedom of information .
The highly stage - managed tour , which included intense media interest in Catherineâ€ ™ s clothing and sightings of the coupleâ€ ™ s baby , Prince George , has been hailed by Australian monarchists as helping bolster support for the royals in the country .
The tourism industry was also pleased with the trip , with analysts predicting that a further $ 50 - 60 m will be spent by tourists who saw the royal couple visit sites such as the Sydney Opera House , Blue Mountains and Uluru .
The cost of the trip , which spanned two weeks , was less than forecast prior to the coupleâ€ ™ s arrival with George .
It is also less than the $ 2.6 m the taxpayer paid to host the Queen and Prince Philip in 2011 , according to the Australian .
In 2010 , the federal and New South Wales governments spent more than $ 3 m financing the visit of US TV host Oprah Winfrey to Australia ."
2014-11-02,"Itâ€ ™ s likely that if you remember anything about Prince William and Kate Middletonâ€ ™ s wedding in 2011 , it will be Princess Beatriceâ€ ™ s crazy â€œpretzelâ€ � hats .
Oh how we laughed and mocked them !
Referring to Beatriceâ€ ™ s Philip Treacy

the Daily Mail asked the question on the minds of many : â€œis that an octopus on her head , or a pair of antlers?â€ � Fast forward to 2014 and weâ€ ™ re all Beatrice and Eugenie now .
The headwear de jour at the Spring Racing Carnivalâ€ ™ s
most fashionable day
â€ “
Derby Day â€ “ is the percher .
Described as â€œthe new fascinatorsâ€ � they sit â€ “ if that is the correct term â€ “ like a mini - shield or a Google Glass headset , a couple of inches from the face , hovering but stable , held firm to the head by way of headband and pins .
In the Rose Room at Derby Day you could count on one hand the hats that looked like hats .
Instead the headgear was skewwhiff , crooked , asymmetrical , tilted â€ “ sitting on the right of the skull , like some sort of accident .
These were hats that appeared incomplete â€ “ like a bite had been taken out of them , or part of the hat had been made , then the milliner had got too busy making other hats and had forgotten to complete it .
But no matter .
If everyone is wearing incomplete hats , then it ceases to look bizarre .
In the Rose Room , the Birdcage , the corporate marquees , the Nursery , the betting ring all these magnificent portions of hats made up for their lack of width by going high .
High spirals , high feathers , high nets , high spikes , high floral arrangements â€ “ mostly in Derby Dayâ€ ™ s trademark colours of black and white .
A hazard of traditional wide - brimmed hats at the races is that cheek kissing becomes difficult ( the kisser has to awkwardly duck under your hat to make contact â€ “ and then they can get tangled in netting , and can bang - up against the brim . )
But the current crop of hats is more likely to take a passer - byâ€ ™ s eye out .
Those with the highest hats created a sort of exclusion zone around themselves , but the extra personal space this afforded them in the crowded marquees was offset by the lean they developed from their lopsided headgear .
Couple this with freakishly high stilettos and buckets of booze , and you feel that by remaining upright â€ “ by being able to walk without tipping over â€ “ is a peculiar feat â€ “ more astounding to watch than anything on the actual racecourse ."
2014-11-14,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge ( commonly known as Prince William and Kate Middleton ) will travel to New York for the first time next month , for a trip incorporating a visit to the September 11 memorial , an NBA basketball game and a gala dinner at the the Metropolitan Museum of Art .
The Royal couple will visit the US , the British government said , in the second week of December in support of a number of wildlife charities and to promote UK business .
The last time the couple traveled to the US was in 2011 , during a high - profile visit to California .
The British Foreign Office , which announced the visit , said the pair planned to visit the National September 11 Memorial and Museum at the World Trade Center .
The Duchess will remain in New York for the duration of the trip but the Duke will travel to Washington , DC , visiting the World Bank to discuss the illegal wildlife trade .
Their attendance at a basketball game on the first night of their visit is connected , the British government said , to a collaboration between the Royal Foundation , United for Wildlife and the NBA ."
2014-12-05,"Buckingham Palace will relax its strict dress code for journalists covering the royal family when Prince William , the Duke of Cambridge , meets Barack Obama at the White House next week .
American journalists reacted with surprise and consternation last month after circulation of the Palaceâ€ ™ s strict dress code , which warns that â€œcasually dressed members of the media will be turned awayâ€ � from royal engagements in the UK and abroad .
The Duke and his wife , the Duchess of Cambridge â€ “ more commonly known as Prince William and Kate Middleton â€
“ are visiting the US east coast for two days next week .
The Palace and the White House confirmed on Friday that the Dukeâ€ ™ s schedule would include a brief encounter with Obama in the Oval office .
â€œSo , weâ€ ™ ll have a little royalty in the House on Monday , â€ � said Obamaâ€ ™ s press secretary Josh Earnest .
A Buckingham Palace spokesperson told the Guardian that it would not be enforcing any dress requirements and would allow the White House to determine appropriate attire .
â€œIt will be down to the White House , as the host , to set the dress code for what media should be wearing , â€ � the spokesman said .
He confirmed that reporters wearing jeans or informal footwear would not be turned away .
â€œOf
course
theyâ€ ™ re not , â€ � he said .
Buckingham Palaceâ€ ™ s rules to reporters covering domestic and international royal engagements , by contrast , state : â€œSmart attire for men includes the wearing of a jacket and tie , and for women a trouser or skirt suit .
Those wearing jeans or trainers will not be admitted and casually dressed members of the media will be turned away .
This also applies to technicians.â€ �
The policy was formally relayed to congressional reporters on Capitol Hill last month .
â€œFirst of all , what are â€˜trainersâ€ ™ , or , for that matter , â€˜techniciansâ€ ™ ?â€ � wrote one American reporter .
â€œAnd second , why should the United Statesâ€ ™ press corps â€ ” who barely bother to brush the muffin crumbs off their polo shirts before lobbing questions at the president of the United States â€ ” schlep extra pieces of clothing to work just so they can make small talk with a ( perfectly nice - seeming ) British air ambulance pilot - in - training and a former chain - store accessories buyer?â€ �
( Trainers , incidentally , is the British word for what Americans call sneakers .
Technicians seems to be a reference to people who use camera or audio equipment . )
Reporters in Washington tend to be more formally dressed than their British counterparts â€ “ although that shouldnâ€ ™ t be confused with them dressing well .
â€œIn Washington , all journalists dress like bank tellers ,
â€ �
Hunter S Thompson wrote in 1972 , a description still apt today .
â€œLeviâ€ ™ s donâ€ ™ t make it in this town ; if you show up wearing Leviâ€ ™ s
they figure youâ€ ™
re either a servant or a messenger .
This is particularly true at high - level press conferences , where any deviation from the standard journalistic dress is considered rude and perhaps even dangerous.â€ �
Yet that appearance is the result of culture rather than formal code , and it is not uncommon to see more rebellious reporters wearing jeans at official engagements , including at the White House .
Rules stipulating suit jackets and ties on the Senate floor are regularly and sometimes even proudly flouted .
The White House does not have a strict dress code for journalists .
Senior White House staff are permitted to turn up to work in â€œa wrinkled button - down and comfortable pantsâ€ � .
A White House spokesperson said there would be no â€œspecial or different dress codeâ€ � for the princeâ€ ™ s visit .
Buckingham Palace said the Duke will â€œpay a visitâ€ � to the vice - president , Joe Biden , during his brief stop at the White House , and also be a guest of the World Bank , half a mile down the road .
The Duchess will remain in New York .
The royal couple will meet a potential 2016 Obama replacement , Hillary Clinton , at a reception in New York .
During their stay in New York , the Duke and Duchess will attend an NBA game .
Buckingham Palace did not say whether its strict dress requirements for those in the vicinity of the royals will extend to fans of the Brooklyn Nets or Cleveland Cavaliers ."
2014-12-07,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have arrived in New York City , at the start of a three - day US east coast visit .
The royal couple â€ “ and a seven - strong entourage which includes adviser and former ambassador to the US Sir David Manning and the Duchess of Cambridgeâ€ ™ s hairdresser , Amanda Cook Tucker , whose services , it has been stressed , are being paid for privately â€ “ touched down at JFK International airport on Sunday evening .
The plane was 40 minutes late , but the couple were nonetheless escorted by motorcade through New Yorkâ€ ™ s infamously bad airport - to - city traffic and to the Carlyle hotel on Manhattanâ€ ™ s Upper East Side .
The hotel , renowned for its old - fashioned opulence and glamorous clientele
â€ “
it hosts Woody Allenâ€ ™ s Monday night Dixieland jazz residency
â€ “ was one of Princess Dianaâ€ ™ s favourite places to stay .
Crowds of expectant New Yorkers and tourists were kept well away as the motorcade swept in .
William and Kate , who are travelling without their 16-month - old son , Prince George , were reported to be due to spend Sunday evening at a private dinner hosted by Sir Martin Sorrell , a British media and marketing mogul .
Wearing a maroon coat from maternity label Seraphine , the Duchess , who is five months pregnant with her second child , looked refreshed despite her long flight .
She and her husband were taken to their room â€ “ a suite with stunning views of Central Park .
The hotel flew the union flag ; the Empire State Building was lit up red , white and blue .
Rose Holyan , of Manhattan , was among hundreds of cheering fans who braved the nearly - freezing temperatures to catch a glimpse of the Duchess as she was whisked by .
â€œI think I saw her outline in the SUV .
At least thatâ€ ™ s what Iâ€ ™ m hoping ,
â€ � the self - described Anglophile told the Guardian , her eyes still scanning the crowd in vain for any sign of the couple .
They had , alas , already been ushered in to the hotel .
Hoylan said she is fascinated by the young couple .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re the royals of my generation , â€ � she said .
â€œI just love their story.â€
�
She said she intended to follow Kate on her solo excursion around the city on Monday morning .
The three - day east coast trip includes the coupleâ€ ™ s first visit to New York City , and the Dukeâ€ ™ s first trip to the nationâ€ ™ s capital .
They previously visited the US in 2011 , when they made a brief stop in California at the end of a Canada tour .
The whirlwind trip is packed with diplomatic engagements as well as commitments championing the coupleâ€ ™ s favorite causes and promoting British interests .
The schedule includes a visit to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum and a NBA basketball game between the Brooklyn Nets and the Cleveland Cavaliers .
Standing across the street from the Carlyle , sisters Ava , 10 , and Madison , 6 , told the Guardian they traveled from Florida with their grandmother entirely on the chance that they might see the duchess .
Their grandmother even purchased tickets to the Nets game , so the girls could be in an arena with royalty .
Asked what she loved about Kate , Ava said : â€œEverything.â€ �
She expanded : â€œKate seems nice and sheâ€ ™ s very pretty.â€
�
The coupleâ€ ™ s trip comes at a tense time for New York , following the failure of a grand jury to indict a police officer in the chokehold death of a man from Staten Island .
In past days , thousands of protesters have taken to the streets to demonstrate against the juryâ€ ™ s decision .
Aids to the royal couple said the demonstrations and protests had not affected William and Kateâ€ ™ s schedule .
But the pair will be afforded extra security .
William , the second - in - line to the throne , will visit Washington DC on Monday to attend a conference at the World Bank Groupâ€ ™ s international corruption hunters alliance , where he is expected to deliver a speech about fighting illegal wildlife trafficking , an issue described as â€œclose to the princeâ€ ™ s heartâ€ � .
While there , William will be received by President Barack Obama at the White House .
He last met Obama in 2011 , when the first couple visited Britain .
The prince is due to meet separately with the vice - president , Joe Biden , and his wife , Dr Jill Biden .
While William is in Washington DC , Kate will tour a child development center in Harlem with New York Cityâ€ ™ s first lady , Chirlane McCray .
The Duchess will help wrap presents and meet the young children during an arts - and - crafts session .
William and Kate will reunite in New York on Monday evening , to attend a reception with former secretary of state and rumored 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton and her daughter , Chelsea Clinton .
The event will highlight wildlife conservation efforts , a theme of their visit .
Then the royals will head to Brooklynâ€ ™ s Barclays Center to catch the second half of the Nets - Cavaliers game .
Internet speculation is rife over a potential courtside meeting between the Cambridges and Americaâ€ ™ s de facto royal couple , BeyoncÃ
© and Jay - Z.
The coupleâ€ ™ s final day in New York will begin with a tour of the Ground Zero site .
The couple will pause at the reflecting pools to pay their respects to the thousands who lost their lives in the attacks of 11 September 2001 .
The duke will spend part of the afternoon with the cityâ€ ™ s mayor , Bill de Blasio , at a reception at the Empire State Building before , on Tuesday evening , joining the duchess at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for a black tie fundraiser in honor the University of St Andrews , where the couple met .
Expected guests at the event , which will be staged around the ancient Egyptian Temple of Dendur , include Tom Hanks and opera singer RenÃ © e Fleming .
Tickets for the event went up to $ 10,000 per seat .
British consul - general to New York , Danny Lopez , told reporters on Sunday morning : â€œOver the last few weeks it has been incredible to witness the level of excitement from people here wanting to be part of this .
The excitement in New York has been absolutely phenomenal.â€ �"
2014-12-08,"Prince William will criticise the illegal wildlife trade in a speech in Washington on Monday .
He is expected to note that in China the wholesale price of ivory has increased from $ 5 ( Â£3 ) to $ 2,100 ( Â£1,472 ) per kilogram in 25 years , and that poaching has increased as a result .
The Duke is to visit China next year and is also expected to up bring up the issue of illegal wildlife trade during the trip .
The China Daily newspaper quoted Kensington Palace as saying that the duke will promote â€œUK - China relations , people to people links , and in support of his work to combat the illegal wildlife trade and support wildlife conservationâ€ � .
According to some media reports , the Dukeâ€ ™ s comments could cause a diplomatic row with China â€ “ but he is not likely to have much impact on the Chinese public .
The Royal Family are popular in China but people are not likely to know much about the Duke himself .
The Duchess and her famous fashion choices are more likely to make an impression .
In fact when faced with a picture of the Duke and Duchess , many Chinese people didnâ€ ™ t know who they were and mistook them for actors .
One person knew who they were but not the Dukeâ€ ™ s name , calling him Prince Kate .
China is the largest market for illegal wildlife trade .
Ivory is popular among wealthy Chinese , rhino horn and other rare animal parts are popular as remedies in traditional Chinese medicine .
Last month , a report claimed that a Chinese delegation accompanying president Xi Jinping to Tanzania last year purchased so much illegal elephant ivory that the prices spiked .
These claims were denied by the Chinese government .
But with many Chinese people not knowing who he is , it is not likely that they will take much notice of the Duke .
Homegrown stars are more likely to have success in raising awareness and have played a large role in conservation efforts .
The famous Chinese former basketball player Yao Ming has been part of a massive campaign using TV messages , billboards and social media to reduce demand for ivory in China .
WildAid , who Yao worked with on a previous campaign over shark fin soup , said that they saw a change in public attitudes to the consumption of shark fin , especially among younger generations .
Another famous Chinese star who is taking part in awareness campaigns is actor Jackie Chan .
He said that attitudes towards buying illegal wildlife products are undergoing â€œa big changeâ€ � .
Chan is also an ambassador for WildAid and features in a primetime advertising campaign that airs on Chinaâ€ ™ s main television channel CCTV ."
2014-12-08,"For a president accused of monarchic tendencies and a monarchy accused of occasional political interference , it was always going to be an awkward exchange of tips and observations on world affairs .
â€œIs
that where the press comes in?â€
� asked a bemused - looking Prince William as the White House media pool barrelled into the Oval Office through a patio window .
â€œYes , â€ � nodded President Obama , with a fixed grin , confident in the knowledge that 20 seconds later his press minders would be ushering reporters and photographers back through the window into a light snowstorm .
British diplomats later explained that the 15 minutes the Duke of Cambridge spent with Obama on his first trip to Washington was partly to â€œtalk about world issuesâ€ � and partly â€œin preparation for his own role one dayâ€ � .
Beyond the clattering of cameras and some polite pleasantries about the families , it was impossible to tell exactly what the monarch - in - waiting learned from the commander - in - chief â€ “
but he seems to be picking up some lessons on US political campaigning at least .
The three - day visit by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to New York and Washington has been marked by the sale of dinner tickets to raise money for the dukeâ€ ™ s charities , a well - worn feature of the US political scene , but something that would raise eyebrows were it carried out so profitably back home .
And William was notably more political in his activities than his younger brother Harry had been on a visit to Congress last year .
William attacked the Chinese ivory trade during a subsequent speech on wildlife conservation at the World Bank with passion that would not have sounded out of place at a rally .
The illegal wildlife trade is â€œone of the most insidious forms of corruption and criminality in the world today , â€ � claimed the duke , pointing to a jump in the wholesale price of Chinese ivory from $ 5 to $ 2,100 per kilogram as a principle driver of poaching .
â€œIt is wrong that children growing up in countries vulnerable to wildlife crime are losing their birthright in order to fuel the greed of international criminals , â€ � added the duke , the second in line to the British throne .
Obama praised Williamâ€ ™ s conservation efforts during their earlier meeting .
â€œVery important work , â€ � he said .
And though the speech was careful not to implicate Chinese consumers directly , it was a diplomatic minefield far removed from the the anti - landmine work preferred by his mother .
â€œOur collective goal must be to reduce the wildlife trade by making it harder : denying traffickers access to transportation , putting up barriers to their illegal activities , and holding people accountable for their actions , â€ �
William also urged the World Bank audience .
â€œThose who look the other way , or spend the illicit proceeds of these crimes , must be held to account.â€ � Harryâ€ ™ s trip to Washington caused a near scrum when young staffers on Capitol Hill thronged the hallways for a glimpse , but this time , the stardust â€ “ in the form of the Duchess of Cambridge â€
“ remained in New York , while the Dukeâ€ ™ s solo visit to DC had the feel of all those other visits by world leaders , rather than a visiting celebrity .
For Obama , it must have seemed like light relief after weeks grappling with Republicanism of a different sort .
His opponents have accused of him of acting like an emperor by taking executive action to grant legal status to migrants without papers .
Whether related or not , he spent much of the weekend in a hospital undergoing medical tests for a persistent sore throat that turned out to have been brought on by acid reflux .
â€œIâ€ ™ m fine .
I was completely fine ,
â€ �
he told reporters during Mondayâ€ ™ s photocall , which was brief even by Oval Office standards .
For public consumption , at least , the two men chose to share a couple of things in particular : fatherhood and the media .
â€œYouâ€ ™ ve got pretty much every member of the press in here , I think .
You couldnâ€
™ t get any more in the Oval Office , â€ � observed the duke , who described the birth of his first son last year as â€œjust chaosâ€ � â€ ™ and the prospect of a second child next year as â€œinteresting and busyâ€ � .
â€œYou forgot to ask [ whether it was a boy or girl?],â€ � asked Obama , the father of two daughters , incredulously .
But despite the relaxed body language , it was impossible not to note behind the two a symbol of Obamaâ€ ™ s supposedly cooler relations with the Brits than many of his predecessors : the bust of Martin Luther King that sits near where George W Bush once displayed a bust of Winston Churchill .
A White House that has long been anxious to downplay the symbolism of the moving Churchill to another spot will hope a friendly quarter of a hour with the future king may go some way to reassuring those ever anxious about the health of the special relationship ."
2014-12-08,"On Monday night , two members of the British royal family , the Duke and Duchess of Kent â€ “ or Prince William and Kate Middleton as they sometimes call themselves â€ “ will take their place in the steep - pitched stands at Barclays Center as the Brooklyn Nets play host to LeBron Jamesâ€ ™ s rejuvenated Cleveland Cavaliers .
The royals ?
That doesnâ€ ™ t sound right .
Horseracing , polo , croquet and rugby : these are the sports of royals .
Basketball , with its street edge , minimal rulekeeping and pick - up spontaneity , seems to represent the antithesis of stagey , ceremony - bound royalty .
And basketball fandom , in New York at least , is most closely associated with the twin figures of a firebrand black film director and his ultra - neurotic , over - thinking Jewish counterpart â€ “ two people as intellectually removed from the pretty , comfortably smug projections of the royal couple as itâ€ ™ s possible to get .
The royalsâ€ ™ trip across the East River is testament to the nascent star power of the host borough .
Everyone wants a bit of Brooklyn these days .
Everyone needs their Brooklyn Experience â€ “ even the heirs to the House of Windsor .
The royal couple will jet in to the Barclays fresh from a flying visit to Washington DC to congratulate Barack Obama and Joe Biden on losing the Senate ; theyâ€ ™ ll also take in the 9/11 memorial in downtown Manhattan .
Once those rote check - ins have been dealt with , itâ€ ™ ll be all Brooklyn .
Although itâ€ ™ s hard to think of a part of Brooklyn less representative of the borough as a whole than that desperate , striving stretch around the junction of Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues , with its jumble of crap malls and pretensions to identity - free commercial sleekness : the Barclays Center paints a Brooklyn that exists , in reality , only around the Barclays Center .
On the face of it , Will and Kate â€ “
I refer to them by their first names , of course , because we are close personal friends â€ “ at the Nets
seems like evidence of some approaching Cultural Singularity .
But think about it :
theyâ€ ™ re rich .
Theyâ€ ™ re from somewhere else .
And they donâ€ ™ t appear to care all that much about basketball .
In that sense , they are the perfect embodiment of the Brooklyn Nets , a product cobbled together from a franchise that has pinballed from Long Island to New Jersey and now to Kings County in the five decades of its existence .
The team from everywhere has found its ideal fan set in the couple from over there .
But then , itâ€ ™ s important to embrace the flux .
Neighbourhoods â€
“ just like royal dynasties â€ “ change .
I didnâ€ ™ t grow up selling crack on the streets of Bed - Stuy ( well , Clinton Hill â€ “ but
whoâ€ ™ s arguing ? )
like Biggie Smalls , so I canâ€ ™ t really appreciate how far Brooklyn has come : when I got here , almost five years ago , there was already a place round the corner selling flat whites .
Gentrification was a done deal , and all that was left to be worked out was the details .
For people who grew up here in the 80s or 90s , living the possibility of death as an everyday subway experience , thereâ€ ™ s probably more good than bad in the post - financial crisis renovation of Brooklyn .
The Nets represent everything that revived , aspirational Brooklyn wants to be : a wide - seated , well - stocked balm to the mean streets in the lesser boroughs beyond .
In their short time as a married couple , Will and Kate have made a point of appearing as approachable and normal as possible .
Rejecting protocol and embracing the very ordinariness of all existence , theyâ€ ™ ve managed to make themselves seem no different from any other rich young trust fund couple .
Theyâ€ ™ ve taken the British royal family down a pay scale or two , to the palatable upper middle class ground of the non - chauffeured SUV .
Theyâ€ ™ ve done to the House of Windsor what countless developers are attempting to do for Brooklyn ( or at the very least , the upper left - hand bit of Brooklyn ) : theyâ€ ™ ve given it a makeover .
When they enter the Barclays Center on Monday night , theyâ€ ™ ll find plenty to jar the senses â€ “ Nathanâ€ ™ s dogs and the still - inexplicable popularity of Coors Light â€ “
but there will be solace in the upscale calorific delights of Fatty Cue and Calexico .
Perhaps Jay - Z and Beyonce will be in attendance , a blanket to reassure that the event and the venue are Safe For The Famous .
And as they circle the perimeter of the stadium towards their seats , bouncing across concrete floors still squeaky underfoot , still shiny with that New Brooklyn sparkle , theyâ€ ™ ll be able to marvel at the example of a borough whose relentless self - smoothing , whose journey from danger and anomie to condo living , ramen burgers and ironic shuffleboard , presents the urban corollary of their own little trick at soft - brushing the royal familyâ€ ™ s rich history of entitlement into a pantomime of violently unassuming middle - class contentment .
The makeover couple at the home of the makeover team : what could be sweeter than that ?
One thingâ€ ™ s for sure :
Will and Kate are unlikely to pay much attention to the game .
The Nets have been reliably underwhelming in their two and a bit seasons â€œbackâ€ � in Brooklyn (
not that they were ever really here to begin with , but still ) .
The cash splash of last season â€ “ Paul Pierce !
Kevin Garnett !
â€ “ yielded meagre returns , and while Deron Williamsâ€ ™ s resurgence this term holds the promise of a better end - of - season payoff ,
thereâ€ ™ s little to suggest the Nets will fulfil anything other than their customary role of playoff makeweights .
Events on the court , in other words , promise to be every bit as drab and routine as the royal visit itself .
Iâ€ ™
d develop the thesis more , but itâ€ ™ s getting late
and I have a date with a ramen burger ."
2014-12-12,"Wayne Rooney and Bobby Charlton have made a video , Uefa has unveiled a monument in Flanders , Prince William has done the same in Staffordshire , and the British Army Football Association â€ “ not an organisation I had run across before â€
“ is preparing to play a team from the Bundeswehr ( the German army ) in Aldershot next week .
Yes , it is time to commemorate the famous football matches on the western front during the 1914 Christmas truce .
It isnâ€ ™ t quite clear how best to celebrate the centenary of something quite so informal and spontaneous .
You can hardly ship out the Queen and send in the marching bands .
A match seems as good an idea as any .
There were many matches , though oddly most of them are remembered as having ended with a score of 3 - 1 to the Germans .
But one of the peculiarities of the Christmas truce is that we are too misty - eyed about it to quite take it seriously as history .
It is true that people described the match at the time as magical and dreamlike â€ “ and spontaneous friendship made in the frost and snow certainly has a degree of magic about it .
It is true that even those taking part wondered whether it might just go on for ever .
But what the truce wasnâ€ ™ t â€ “ at least not in the British and German lines
â€ “ was political or pacifist , unlike similar demonstrations on the French and Russian fronts later in the war .
Nor was it universal : some ( like a young Hitler ) refused to take part , some even shot at the enemy as they came out of the trenches .
Eight British soldiers were killed during the Christmas Day truce .
If we are going to take this event seriously â€ “ as we should â€ “
we need to address some of the continuing mysteries and discomforts about it .
First , would we have been so enthusiastic about the truce if it had taken place on Dover beach at Christmas 1940 with Nazi invaders ?
The Germans in 1914 accused the British of not taking the war seriously ; of getting involved in something them didnâ€ ™ t concern them .
Perhaps there was just enough truth in that to let the truce happen .
There were other truces in 1915 and later â€ “ and there are always instances of chivalrous â€œlive and let liveâ€ � in military history â€ “ but 1914 was before poison gas , the Lusitania , nurse Edith Cavell and the other events that embittered the allied side , and made football between the trenches more difficult .
Then there were the local Belgian civilians , who spat at the British troops for fraternising with the invaders .
Did the truce let the German high command off the hook for the atrocities committed against civilians in Belgium ?
Of course , this wasnâ€ ™ t fraternisation with Moltke , the chief of the German general staff , or the Kaiser himself .
It was with ordinary soldiers â€ “ made possible because so many on the German side had worked in Britain before the war and spoke English .
We are used to seeing the first world war through the eyes of the war poets and Oh What a Lovely War , and it is hard to see 1914 â€ “ when trench warfare was new , before the Somme or Passchendaele â€ “ as it seemed at the time .
Finally , the mystery .
Because , for the French and Germans , these are still revelations â€ “ a French historian recently wrote about the truce under the title
The Last Taboo .
There are so many first - hand accounts in the UK that the football matches seem a straightforward story .
Not so .
There is still disagreement about who instigated the many tiny ceasefires .
( It was primarily the Germans , although the British were the main instigators of the football matches . )
But what about the officers ?
The commander - in - chief , Sir John French , wrote in his autobiography that he had called his commanders to account and it â€œresulted in a good deal of troubleâ€ � .
Almost all evidence of this trouble , whatever it was , has now disappeared , but it is a clue as to what really happened .
It seems likely that most of the battalion officers in the frontline welcomed the truce as an opportunity â€ “ not just to bury the dead , but to repair trenches in the appalling weather .
Perhaps the discovery of how many senior officers had encouraged fraternisation was the trouble that French was referring to .
Perhaps that was what scared the top brass .
It is difficult to know now .
What is clear is that few of them , if any , expected the ceasefires to last into the new year , or that it would involve quite so much football .
Or that the sense of peace that happened over Christmas as a result , and the burying of the dead together , would change lives and inspire so many who lived through it .
So good luck to the Army Football Association and their Aldershot rematch .
This time I hope someone brings along a useable ball ."
2014-12-17,"Last week , when Prince William and his wife , Princess Elsa from Frozen , visited the United States , Piers Morgan â€ “ the self - appointed British commentator on America â€ “ proved how little he understands the US when he wrote an article saying that the royalsâ€ ™ popularity with its citizens proves America should have its own monarchy .
In fact , the US already has more monarchies than it knows what to do with , from the faded glories of the House of Kennedy to the glittering Court of Clinton and the defiant Dynasty of Bush .
( â€œThe Dynasty of Bushâ€ � sounds like a terribly disparaging term for Linda Evans , Kate Oâ€ ™ Mara and Joan Collins .
I must stress that I would rather eat my own hair than ever disparage Queen Joan . )
Here are families who , with varying degrees of merit , exist in a world of gilded celebrity , who consider power and money their God - given right , purely because of their surname â€ “ the very definition of a monarchy .
This perfectly obvious fact was underlined yesterday when â€ “ like President James Madison taking his feather quill to stress an article in the US constitution â€ “ Jeb Bush wrote on Facebook : â€œI am excited to announce that I will actively explore the possibility of running for president of the United States.â€
�
You really do have to love that distinctly Bushian use of English â€ “ â€œactively explore the possibility
â€
¦
â€ �
You could take out 15 words in that sentence and it would still mean the same thing .
As the late and much missed Robin Williams once said so wisely of the Bush dynasty , itâ€ ™ s hard not to applaud a family â€œwhere the smart brother is named Jebâ€ � .
( Incidentally , Jeb is not short for Jebediah , as you might have reasonably assumed â€ “ itâ€ ™ s an acronym for John Ellis Bush , like Arrested Developmentâ€ ™ s Gob Bluth is an acronym for George Oscar Bluth . )
Anyway , as Facebook status updates go , announcing a maybe possible consideration of running for president of the United States seems , at first , marginally more interesting than someone telling you how much traffic they encountered on their way to work .
Until , that is , you remember it came from a Bush , at which point it takes on the stale flavour of weary inevitability and utter predictability .
Should Hillary Clinton win the next election and get two terms , followed by Jeb Bush for the next two terms â€ “ a scenario that is far from impossible â€ “ the American presidency would have been controlled by two monarchies for 44 years , with a brief Obama interlude .
Rather knocks the Qin Dynasty ( 221BC-206 BC ) into a cocked hat or , that is , a cocked crown .
And thatâ€ ™ s not even counting the all - but - guaranteed eventual ascendancy of President Chelsea Clinton ( George Wâ€ ™ s daughters , Jenna and Barbara ,
have heretofore not shown any political inclinations , although that certainly didnâ€ ™ t stop their father from becoming the most powerful man in the free world . )
Any suggestion that the American political system is democratic is so outdated it has taken on the quality of an ancient myth .
Outliers â€ “ such as Barack Obama , for one â€ “ are the exception , and the norm is dynastic families .
As my colleague Gary Younge pointed out in this paper last month , the midterm elections were more dependent on family names than the British aristocracy .
Now , this is hardly unique to the American political world â€ “
Britain has its Benns and Johnsons and Straws ; and India , well , letâ€ ™ s not even get started on that .
But whatâ€ ™ s especially noticeable about American political dynasties is how they play up their familial connections .
The midterm candidates frequently referenced their political parents when on the stump , and we can certainly look forward to plenty of emotional speeches from olâ€ ™ Bill for Hillary and references to George HW from Jeb , if perhaps fewer to George W â€ “ but not necessarily none .
Which brings me to perhaps the key factor in US dynasties : brand recognition .
Whenever people write about Americaâ€ ™ s love of political dynasties , much is made of how ironic this is considering it goes against the ideals upon which America is built : meritocracy !
Bootstrap - pulling !
But it is , quite clearly , precisely because it is so un - American that America canâ€
™ t help but be fascinated with familial dynasties .
We always want what we donâ€
™ t have and so America , a country founded at least partly as a reaction against the idea of a royal family ,
canâ€ ™ t help but create royal versions of its own .
But there is something else going on here : brand familiarity .
America loves brands .
Hell , Malcolm Gladwell once wrote a 5,000-word essay in the New Yorker about why Americans refuse to use any ketchup besides Heinz .
Go into any supermarket in the US and you will see seemingly infinite items in a series of minute variations all from one single brand .
( Paul Newmanâ€ ™ s salad dressing , for starters , comes in 25 flavours . )
Now that running for office in America is so ridiculously expensive , only those with brand recognition are likely to appeal to , and have access to , wealthy fundraisers and lobbyists .
Who has more wealthy Democrats on speed dial than the Clintons ?
Who has more access to the Republican party than a Bush ?
This is where sentimentality and lazy thinking combine to meet practicalities .
Even if the political brand is tainted , as the Bush one certainly is and the Clinton one arguably is , this doesnâ€ ™ t necessarily outweigh the reassurance of familiarity .
The one voice in the Republican party suggesting America might have had enough of the Bush family is Jebâ€ ™ s
mother , Barbara ; the only real criticism voiced about him is that heâ€
™ s a bit â€œcenteristâ€ � on education and immigration .
Other than that , no problem : release the Bushmobile !
The prospect of a Bush v Clinton election for 2016 feels like the inevitable end point for a country that is increasingly stagnated by social immobility , coupled with a national fascination with famous families , from the Clintons to the Hiltons .
But there is something else to consider here .
Perhaps it is time for the most truly famous family in America , the most powerful dynasty in the western world , to make its first run for political office .
For 2016 I have a vision , and itâ€ ™ s a vision in which Clinton and Bush lose to the independent candidate , who seizes control of the White House and her family holds on to it for at least the next century .
Greetings , President Kim Kardashian .

2014-12-27,"For the Middleton household , this time of year always takes us back to a time when my bottom still had a private life .
Picture it snuggled by the fireside , while the Middleton clan feasts on naughty seasonal fare and the occasional glass of vintage vino ( of which more later ) irregardless of any royal connections .
But now that we are joined by my brother - in - law , Prince William , and my nephew , Prince George , this holiday should be extra lively .
Like any typical British toddler , George is just learning to shoot .
And if my fun brother - in - law Prince Harry joins the family , we can expect plenty of â€œfrogâ€ � banter about my old French friend , the Vicomte .
Typical !
It might seem hard to believe , but before my bottom became a global sensation , we celebrated New Year much like any other close - knit Berkshire family , with just a few local caterers and florists creating a cosy fÃªte - champÃªtre for no more than a couple of hundred close friends .
I have fond memories of the day my mother spelled out a huge X on the lawn , entirely out of my sisterâ€ ™ s underwear , so my future brother - in - law , Prince William , would know where to land his helicopter for the traditional New Yearâ€ ™ s masked hog roast .
The blades made it fly all over the place , and as a forfeit we made the prince bob for eggs with a traditional thong on his head !
Old - fashioned British games are a must at any Middleton celebration .
Though I have it on good authority that some of Englandâ€ ™ s most respected families prefer strip pÃ
© tanque !
Another fun game is sardines .
On that subject , I still remember the time when Kate and William had to spend over 48 hours in a cupboard located under the stairs .
My mother had accidentally locked the door !
Fortunately , we Middleton girls are nothing if not practical , and it is a family tradition to leave a delicious Waitrose supper for two and a change of thongs in there , just in case .
Spin the bottle is another Middleton favourite .
To play it , you need a bottle , almost any Waitrose bottle will do , but if it still contains liquid you might want to put the top on prior to spinning .
Traditionally , the person it points to has to marry the other person .
Tip : have a translator handy .
French people do not always understand the English rules , although my mother says she could not have explained it more clearly .
Iâ€ ™
d be lying if I said I didnâ€ ™ t take the chance to forget healthy eating for an hour or two at New Year .
As shameless traditionalists , we Middletons still hold a Viennese - style ball every New Yearâ€ ™ s Eve , starting with my signature canapÃ
© s : stir - fried Waitrose stollen , drizzled with lashings of pureed haggis .
Tip :
donâ€ ™ t forget to invite some people , as few or as many as you like , though I recommend making a record of the number , so your marquee will be the right size .
Decorate with bunting , a colourful flag - like substance which can be suspended between two different places .
In my earlier career , as a roving bunting expert , I learned to distinguish different types , and to make sure the middle always hangs down lower than the sides .
For afters , yummy Waitrose mince pies are a must - have , served with Vietnamese prawns and bacon jellies in every hue .
I know a winter - themed celebration for 2,000 might sound daunting , but if you start getting ready in September it leaves the daytime free for shooting or hunting or running a marathon in a tiny pair of mud - soaked shorts , whatever you fancy .
Like most families , we Middletons always find a moment in the New Year downtime to gather round a roaring fire with a tray of comforting turkey and haddock kebabs , and look back on the year .
Nothing says Auld Lang Syne quite like my motherâ€ ™ s media spreadsheet .
Woe betide the Middleton who has not brought a stack of the dreaded press cuttings !
I predict fierce competition when my sisterâ€ ™ s homemaking achievements come up against the edgier waves my little brother James has been making in the world of bespoke royal marshmallows .
And having been on what one might call the receiving end ( ! )
I can only admire the way James copes with the unwanted paps when he is out promoting royal marshmallows with supercool TV personality Donna Air .

In History is the working title for a TV series which will follow my journey through time and place , starting with my sisterâ€ ™ s wedding
As a journalist I adore journalism , so since deciding , entirely of my own accord , to let the Daily Telegraph column go , it has been thrilling to be commissioned by a leading US TV company , where there is a serious shortage of experienced writers with an in - depth knowledge of Hungerford .
Great Bottoms
In History is the working title for a series which will follow my journey through time and place , starting with my sisterâ€ ™ s wedding , and also feature such exceptional hindquarters as Churchillâ€ ™ s , which he famously sat on throughout the war , as well as historyâ€ ™ s most tragic butt ever ( poor Kim Kardashian ) , prior to bringing my bottomology right up to date with a comparison between the typical Middleton derriere and Boris Johnsonâ€ ™ s ( I dare you Boris ! ) .
Most of us have bottoms but itâ€ ™
s amazing how little we know about them .
There will be practical hints , too .
What makes the perfect bottom ?
And how have I kept it that way ?
But the most exciting thing of all about 2014 , speaking as someone who never imagined she would one day be an international wine expert , has been my new qualification as an international wine expert .
To be honest , nothing I have done , not even leaving the Telegraph , has been tougher than swotting for the two - week correspondence course gifted by my mother after I hit the big three - oh .
But she is right , as always : these days I can hold my own with any French aristocrat ( most of whom have no proper royal relations , even if they are Vicomtes ) .
And itâ€ ™ s going to be great in my new TV series , What Kate Drinks , to share my expertise with ordinary Americans who long to be able to enjoy wine , in all its multi - thinged [ subs pls adjust as appropriate Px ] glory , but donâ€ ™ t know how .
Iâ€ ™ ll be saving most of my wine tips for my next book , Inebriate ! , Penguinâ€ ™ s
lead title for 2015 , but to give you a flavour , no pun intended , herewith are some expert hints for anyone thinking of toasting the New Year in .
1 .
Donâ€ ™ t be nervous .
Most supermarkets have a wide selection of wine for sale .
Just make sure you pick a time when Waitrose is open .
If youâ€ ™ re unlucky enough to look ridiculously young for your age , I recommend taking proof of identity , or a copy of the Daily Mail , whichever is handier .
2 .
Which colour ?
Really , this is up to you .
Do you prefer red , or whiteish , or pink ?
If none of these fit your chosen theme or outfit , donâ€ ™ t worry , food colourings work brilliantly in wine .
Chez Middleton , we always settle down in front of Wimbledon with an emerald hued chardonnay , to accompany a selection of seasonal toffee - apples and matching hand - filled crackers .
3 .
Now you need to pick a country .
Perhaps Italy floats your boat , or Spain might be a fun , festive alternative .
Decorate the bottle with castanets .
As a sporty type , I take a special interest in any wine from Australia .
It goes well with cricket , and peppermint creams sculpted into kangaroos .
Tip : make the kangaroos the night before , using a book about Australian fauna as your guide , and serve on a bat , to make the feast more special .
4 .
How much ?
Have a kitchen clear - out before shopping , to make sure you have space for your wine .
If space is still short , digging underneath your house is a fun way of creating storage .
Tip : children will enjoy helping .
5 .
If youâ€ ™ re the practical type , it can be fun to make your own wine .
If you ensure your vineyard is in a warm area , your grapes should be ready in September .
You could make grape - picking special by asking guests to a relaxed , harvest - themed celebration .
I like the idea of piping hot sushi , served on haystacks , and melons stuffed with moussaka - filled bagels .
6 .
Lastly , invest in a good sharp corkscrew , and a couple of spares .
I have learned , through bitter experience , that modern â€œscrewtopâ€ � bottles are particularly hard on corkscrews .
Civilised extras include glasses , one for each guest , so they have something to drink out of .
Bottoms up !

2015-01-27,"Prince William was not good enough to qualify for Sandhurstâ€ ™ s top honour , a former army officer at the military academy has revealed at a trial at the Old Bailey .
Lieutenant colonel ( retired )
Roy Parkinson told jurors at the trial of four Sun journalists that the Duke of Cambridge was in the â€œtop thirdâ€ � of his year , but he was never in the running for the institutionâ€ ™ s coveted â€œsword of honourâ€ � .
Parkinson told the court that a report in the Sun in 2006 was incorrect when it claimed the royal was â€œodds onâ€
� to win the award , which is given to the military academyâ€ ™ s best cadet each year and in 2006
â€
“ the year William trained at Sandhurst â€ “ was won by a female colleague .
â€œIt was never true , â€ � said Parkinson of the Sunâ€ ™ s report .
â€œHe was in the top third â€ ¦
To be in the running at all you have got to be a junior under officer.â€ �
Parkinson said there were â€œsomething like 16 of themâ€ � in Williamâ€ ™ s year .
â€œAnd was Prince William ever one of those?â€ � asked prosecutor Michael Parroy .
â€œNo , â€ � said Parkinson .
The retired lieutenant colonel was giving evidence at the Old Bailey where four Sun journalists are on trial over allegations they were involved in a plot to pay public officials for stories .
The four , including the paperâ€ ™ s royal correspondent Duncan Larcombe , deny the charges .
Parkinson was an instructor at Sandhurst and acted as the spokesman for the academy in 2005 and 2006 .
He told jurors how security had to be â€œbeefed upâ€ � at the military school when Prince William and Harry were in training .
The trial heard earlier from a former Sandhurst instructor who said the institution prepared for the arrival of the princes with extra precautions put in place .
These included what the judge called â€œshamâ€ � training schedules to act as a decoy , with the real programmes printed out and circulated to a limited few .
However , Parkinson said there were several attempts by members of the press to break into the grounds , and one occasion when an Afghan refugee eluded security by hiding on a bus from Germany that was carrying a football team due to play at the college .
â€œHe jumped out of the bus in the middle of Sandhurst , â€ � said Parkinson .
â€œIt was quite a shock.â€ � Parkinson told jurors Sandhurst knew someone was leaking the genuine training programmes because photographers would turn up on exercises , including one in the Black Mountains where they were staked out in â€œvery
inaccessible areaâ€ � waiting to snap the princes .
â€œIt was very worrying because we knew someone was leaking the training programme .
Will and Harry had their own security detail but because we knew someone was leaking the training programme , security had to be beefed up for everyone â€ “ not just on this exercise but on them all , â€ � he said .
Separately , the jury was told that Prince Harry was given special treatment during his training at Sandhurst , being allowed to leave the campus to visit his girlfriend .
In a witness statement , freelance photographer Andy Bush said he spent eight days at Bovington Camp â€ “ a military training ground in Dorset â€
“ in July 2006 as part of a â€œwatch
teamâ€ � for the Sun .
â€œWhile in the area
I noticed that Prince Harry was regularly leaving the camp between 16.00 and 18.00 hours each evening , â€ � said Bushe .
Through a process of elimination he worked out where the prince was going , leading to a story in the paper headlined : â€œGuess where Harryâ€ ™ s secret Love Nest isâ€
� .
â€œI think it would be of interest to some people in that it shows that Prince Harry received special treatment in that he was allowed to leave Bovington Camp during training , â€ � said Bush .
On trial are the Sunâ€ ™ s deputy editor Geoff Webster and executive editor Fergus Shanahan , the paperâ€ ™ s chief reporter John Kay and royal correspondent Larcombe .
All four deny conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office .
The trial continues ."
2015-01-27,"Private photos of Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge on holiday in Mustique while they were dating were handed to the police by the Sun , a court has heard .
The princeâ€ ™ s
former principal private secretary told a jury at the Old Bailey that they had been stolen from a member of the duchessâ€ ™ s family .
It is believed the photos were taken in April 2006 when Kate was being pursued regularly by paparazzi .
Jamie Lowther - Pinkerton could not recall , however , phoning the paperâ€ ™ s royal correspondent Duncan Larcombe to thank him personally on behalf of William for not publishing the pictures , he told the jury .
Lowther - Pinkerton was giving evidence in the trial of four Sun journalists .
All have been charged with being involved in a plot to pay public officials for stories , charges which they all deny .
Lowther - Pinkerton was called as a defence witness by Larcombe .
He recalled hearing that the Sun made a declaration in January 2007 not to use any paparazzi pictures of Kate and that â€œthis was well
receivedâ€ � by the future duke and duchess .
Under examination by the prosecution , he told how William and Prince Harry found leaks about them while they were training at Sandhurst military academy unsettling .
He said the princes did not know the source or sources of stories about them in the Sun while they were training in 2005 and began to doubt their peers and instructors .
â€œIt had an unsettling effect .
The nature of the training was very intensive , particularly if itâ€ ™ s your first time in a military environment and really you are forming a close bond with instructors .
â€œIf you
donâ€
™ t know where this information is coming from you begin to suspect [ people ] quite naturally where a lot of people should not suspect â€ “ itâ€ ™ s very unsettling , â€ � he said .
He confirmed it was very important for the princes that they did not get any special treatment at the military academy .
Lowther - Pinkerton told the jury that he recalled having conversations with Larcombe when they both travelled to New Zealand to cover Williamâ€ ™ s tour with the British Lions .
Richard Kovalevsky , defending Larcombe , said that during that tour the prince revealed he felt he had to go into the army if he was going to be conducting official duties related to past wars .
â€œWere you present when Prince William made it clear that , as he was going to attend official duties such as memorials and the Cenotaph , it was very important that he goes to Sandhurst to gain respect so that he could discharge this public function , â€ � asked Kovalevsky .
â€œI do not recall that conversation , â€ � replied Lowther - Pinkerton ."

2015-02-12,"The Sunâ€ ™ s linguistic style and editorial values came under sustained attack at the Old Bailey with questions about the public interest justification for stories about Prince Harry and Prince William .
Prosecutors quizzed the paperâ€ ™ s chief reporter , John Kay , about stories ranging from reports about Prince Harryâ€ ™ s infected blisters , a Gurkha whose throat was slit at Sandhurst or the death of Prince Williamâ€ ™ s former army instructor in Afghanistan .
Kay is on trial over allegations he unlawfully paid an MoD official Bettina Jordan - Barber for stories over an eight - year period between 2004 and 2012 .
On his second day in the witness box at the Old Bailey , he was quizzed for two hours about stories , including one he wrote revealing that Prince Harry â€œwas in agony in hospitalâ€ � after he â€œgot blisters that became infectedâ€ � in Sandhurst in 2005 .
â€œNo doubt , lots of cadets get blisters .
The only reason this is in here is because this is Prince Harry?â€
� asked prosecutor Michael Parroy .
Kay replied that the story â€œshowed he was getting stuck in to his trainingâ€ � .
Parroy pressed him again : â€œIf it was ] any other cadet with blisters , this story would never have appeared in the paper at all.â€ � â€œNo , no of course not , â€ � replied Kay .
The prosecutor put it to Kay that the â€œany connection with the royal family is something the Sun trades
on.â€
�
Kay agreed .
â€œYes , to a certain extentâ€ � .
â€œWas that fair?â€ �
Parroy asked .
â€œI think it is fair , â€ � replied Kay .
â€œBecause the training of Prince William and Prince Harry is of considerable public interest.â€ �
Parroy went on to quiz him about language used in stories such as a reference to â€œfurious army top brassâ€ � .
Kay said this was based on information he had received from the ministry of defence .
He was also challenged on the accuracy of the reference in a story to a woman in the â€œintelligence corpâ€ � as a â€œspyâ€ � .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a generic term , â€ � said Kay .
At one point Parroy accused Kay of writing â€œa smutty little storyâ€ � about two officers
â€œskinny dippingâ€ � in Sandhurst .
It was headlined : â€œHarry , this is your captain streakingâ€ � .
Kay said he believed the story was in the public interest as it concerned the conduct of officers .
Turning to the killing of Prince Wiliamâ€ ™ s former instructor , Kay concurred with Parroy that this was â€œa considerable tragedyâ€ � .
He was then challenged about an internal email in which he referred to the story about the death as a â€œbelting exclusive splashâ€ � .
After being quizzed about the language in his email repeatedly , the judge intervened telling Parroy that â€œthe mere fact that itâ€ ™ s tragic , does not mean that it is not a perfectly good storyâ€ � .
A Sun story about a Gurkha being attacked at Sandhurst also came under the spotlight .
â€œEssentially Mr Kay this has nothing to do with Sandhurst at all?â€ � asked Parroy .
â€œA Gurkha having his throat slit and left fighting for his life is a scandal , â€ � Kay replied .
Parroy put it to him that it was a â€œsad domestic incident involving mental illnessâ€ � .
Deadpan throughout the cross - examination , Kay replied :
â€œI canâ€

� â€œWould
it have made a difference if he had not lived at
Sandhurst?â€ � asked Parroy .
â€œYes , â€ � replied Kay .
â€œHis connection with Sandhurst is what makes the story , being the worldâ€ ™ s most famous military academy.â€
�
â€œSo it simply comes down to the Gurkha was at Sandhurst?â€ �
â€œYes.â€ � â€œDescribing it as a scandal you say is fair ?
â€œDefinitely.â€ �
Earlier Kay agreed that it was important that he , as a journalist , produced balanced and accurate reports .
He had also said that reporting on the â€œsexual pecadilloesâ€ � of army personnel was in the public interest as affairs were against the armyâ€ ™ s code of social conduct .
â€œTo improperly sensationalise them would be dreadful journalism wouldnâ€ ™ t
it , â€ � Parroy had put to him .
â€œIt would indeed , â€ � said Kay .
Kay and two other senior Sun editors , Geoffrey Webster and Fergus Shanahan , are charged with conspiring to cause misconduct in public office .
All three deny the charges .

2015-02-20,"Sir David Attenborough and a group of broadcasters , conservationists and MPs have called on the Chinese president to end his countryâ€ ™ s ivory trade and save African elephants from extinction .
In an open letter to Xi Jinping , comedian Ricky Gervais , actor Joanna Lumley Labour MP Tessa Jowell , former environment minister Richard Benyon and Kenyan politician and conservationist Richard Leakey ask Chinaâ€ ™ s leader to outlaw the buying and selling of ivory and educate Chinese citizens on the problem .
The intervention is intended to put pressure on China , the worldâ€ ™ s biggest market for ivory , despite a global ban in 1989 , ahead of a visit by Prince William to the country next month .
The prince is due to make a statement on conservation on 4 March in Yunnan province , and will visit a sanctuary for Asian elephants .
Conservationists expect him to talk about the wildlife trade , including ivory .
In a speech last December he noted the street price of ivory in China had increased from $ 5 ( Â£3.20 ) to $ 2,100 per kg in 25 years and was being reflected in increases in poaching .
â€œThose who look the other way [ on the wildlife trade ] , or spend the illicit proceeds of these crimes , must be held to account , â€ �
he said .
The heads of several dozen conservation organisations , 34 MPs and naturalists such as Stanley Johnson , Virginia McKenna and Steve Backshall are among those who have signed the new letter , which warns that China risks damaging its international image over the ivory trade .
â€œWe believe your people , as well as the global community , would welcome your decision to ban a trade that perpetuates so much cruelty and , as a consequence , a negative image of China internationally , â€ � they write .
The signatories are unequivocal about Chinaâ€ ™ s key role in the trade , citing research by the international wildlife trade body , Cites , that the countryâ€ ™ s increasingly affluent middle class is causing demand for ivory to soar .
â€œUnless urgent actions are taken by the international community , and China in particular , to stop this demand , the killing of elephants will continue unabated and could lead to their extinction in much of their range areas within a short time â€ “ possibly as little as 10 years , â€ � the letter , organised by Denise Dresner of Action for Elephants , says .
More than 20,000 elephants are being killed annually in Africa , Cites data shows â€ “ while the UN puts the figure much higher at 32,000 â€ “ leading experts to warn they risk being declared extinct at a local level in some countries .
China is sensitive to allegations that it is directly responsible for the elephant poaching crisis .
A report claiming ivory prices in Tanzania spiked during a visit to the country by Xi prompted a swift dismissal from Chinaâ€ ™ s foreign ministry , which said it was â€œstrongly
dissatisfiedâ€ � with the report .
Although there is an international ban on trading ivory , China is allowed by Cites to trade ivory at a domestic level even though conservationists say it allows illegal ivory to be easily laundered .
The open letter says this trade needs to end .
â€œMr
President , we urge and implore you to act decisively to finally end Chinaâ€ ™ s domestic ivory trade ( both legal and illegal ) , and to consider the many ways this will serve Chinaâ€ ™ s long - term political and economic interestsâ€ � . ."
2015-02-24,"A picture of Prince William in a bikini , for which a former Sandhurst colour sergeant was paid Â£4,000 , never existed , a court has heard .
The photograph is at the centre of a criminal case against John Hardy , an instructor at the military academy , who has been charged over selling stories about Princes William and Harry to the Sun 10 years ago .
â€œI have not seen the picture , the police havenâ€
™ t seen the picture , the Sun havenâ€ ™ t seen it
â€
¦ there is no picture.â€ � said Hardy at the Old Bailey trial .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve never seen a photo of Prince William in a bikini .
I never gave a photo of Prince William to anyone , â€ � he added .
Hardy is on trial at the Old Bailey for misconduct in public office over allegedly receiving more than Â£23,000 for leaking information about the princes and others between 2006 and 2008 .
Jurors heard that the paperâ€ ™ s royal editor , Duncan Larcombe , who is on trial for allegedly aiding and abetting Hardy , phoned him in April 2006 after hearing Prince William had attended a James Bond fancy dress party dressed in a bikini and a Hawaiian shirt .
At this point Hardy , who was in Australia at the time , was already a paid source of the paper .
He told jurors he â€œfabricated a storyâ€ � to make it appear that he could get a photo of Prince William in order to get money out of the Sun .
â€œI said Iâ€ ™ d heard about it .
At the time I didnâ€ ™ t know [ if there was a photo ] and asked him to call back in a hour , â€ � he said .
Did he phone his colleagues in Sandhurst , asked his counsel Simon Csoka .
â€œNo , It would be madness to do that , [ to ask ] â€˜do you have a photo because Iâ€ ™ m going to get a lot of money for itâ€ ™ .
It would be asking for trouble.â€ �
Jurors have already heard about an internal Sun email from Larcombe requesting approval for the Â£4,000 up - front payment , suggesting the photo belonged to Prince Williamâ€ ™ s platoon commander at Sandhurst .
Larcombe told the jury on Monday that he now knows it was not a platoon commander who had the photograph .
Hardy , who was a non - commissioned officer , told jurors he did not tell Larcombe he could get the photo from such a senior officer as he would not have known the officer in question .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s no way I would message him , go out for a drink with him .
I wouldnâ€ ™ t know him .
It would be madness [ to ask him if he had the photo],â€ � said Hardy .
The paper published a story about the party on 9 September 2006 with a mock - up of the princeâ€ ™ s face on a manâ€ ™ s bikini - clad body .
A cash payment was made in June 2006 and picked up by Hardyâ€ ™ s wife Claire at a branch of Thomas Cook in London .
Hardy told his wife he had won the money gambling .
Hardy who was posted at the military academy between 2004 and 2006 , said all he ever passed on to the paper was information that was already in the public domain and not confidential .
He told jurors he also had a â€œself - imposedâ€ � rule about his disclosures to the paper which was â€œnever put my soldiers at riskâ€ � .
Hardy said the first payment he got from the Sun was â€œthe easiest money Iâ€ ™ ve ever madeâ€ � because he had just passed on information about Prince William that had already been in an official army briefing about the prince .
He recalled how he had been phoned by the Sunâ€ ™ s royal editor to ask if the prince was getting his first leave of absence five weeks into Sandhurst in 2006 .
â€œI said , â€˜yes , everyone was banned from leaving in the first five weeksâ€ ™ ,â€ � said Hardy .
He said he had checked it on the internet first and saw that Lieutenant Colonel Parkinson , who was responsible for dealing with the press at Sandhurst , had already made this public .
â€œEvery time I would give something to Duncan , I would check on the internet .
Yes , I said , everybody is banned , it was common knowledge , it was all over the internet , â€ � said Hardy .
â€œI
didnâ€
™ t think I had given him any information saying something the lieutenant colonel hadnâ€
™ t already said , â€ �
he said .
He said other stories about bayonet training or patrol competition in Wales known as Exercise Long Reach were also based on information that was in the public domain .
He said the date and location of the patrol exercise never changed and anyone could have placed the princes on that exercise .
He explained six coaches would have taken the 280 cadets on the intake to Wales and the princesâ€ ™ coach would have been easily identified on the road because â€œthere would be three black range rovers following the coach with the princesâ€ � .
â€œDid you consider you were breaking any confidence?â€ � asked Csoka .
â€œNo.â€ � â€œWas there any security issue?â€
� â€œNo , I could class myself as a security expert .
There is no security breach saying that Prince William was going on an exercise with 280 others on his intake that for the last five years everyone else on their intake had done , â€ � said Hardy .
Hardy told how he once gave Larcombe a link to a YouTube video about nuclear , biological and chemical training for a story about Prince Harry .
He didnâ€ ™ t divulge anything confidential .
This training was compulsory for all cadets , he said .
He twice told jurors that army pay was poor and that he would never have done anything to risk his pension .
The perk was the only reason to stay in the army for 22 years , he said .
Jurors heard he had to do a second job to make ends meet while at Sandhurst , including stints working at Ascot race course .
He was paid between Â£24,000 and Â£25,000 after 16 yearsâ€ ™ service .
â€œThe pay is not very good .
Most people donâ€ ™ t do it for the pay.â€ �
Out of that , he had to pay Â£150 a week to get to work because he lived in Windsor at the time .
In addition he had a Â£100-a week - mess bill .
Earlier Hardy testified that when he first contacted the Sun , the legal department on the paper told him it was not a criminal offence to leak information .
Hardy says the newsdesk didnâ€ ™ t know he was a soldier when he made the initial call , but that the legal department did .
â€œThey said I would get into trouble with my employer , but it wasnâ€ ™ t a criminal offence.â€ �
Hardy first got in contact with the Sun in 2005 in response to adverts he saw in the paper offering cash for stories .
He was keen to pass on stories which showed the princes â€œin a positive lightâ€ � .
He told how he had spent a year reading made - up and negative stories about Prince Harry , citing one report about the young royal being hospitalised after blisters on his feet got infected .
This , he said , was â€œuntrueâ€ � and did not happen .
â€œThey put some iodine on it and he want back to work , â€ � said Hardy .
Asked by his counsel if he understood what the consequences would be if confidential information was leaked , he replied : â€œYes .
People would die.â€
�
He said he knew leaking information , even of no consequence to security , might have got him into trouble , but he said â€œat my rank , it would have been a slap on the wristâ€ � .
Hardy has denied committing misconduct in public office .
His wife and Larcombe , who have been charged with aiding and abetting him , have also pleaded not guilty .
The trial continues ."
2015-02-25,"A Sandhurst instructor accused of unlawfully selling information about Prince William to the Sun has told a court he gave conflicting accounts of his contact with the paper because he felt â€œbitter and twistedâ€ � after he was revealed as a source .
John Hardy was accused by prosecutors of telling two different accounts of his contact with the paper , one in his evidence at the Old Bailey , and another in his defence case statement , written in 2013 .
Giving evidence at the Old Bailey on Tuesday , Hardy said his first contact with the paper was in 2005 when he rang the newsdesk after seeing an advert inviting soldiers to ring the paper with stories .
He was then told by the paperâ€ ™ s legal department that he might get into trouble with his bosses , but leaking information would not be a criminal offence .
Some time later he made contact with the royal editor Duncan Larcombe and became a paid source for the paper .
On Wednesday , the prosecution pressed him on why he gave a different account in his defence case statement .
In that , he said he had met someone known as Duncan in 2001 on his way back to his barracks after the changing of the guards at Buckingham Palace .
He said he believed him to be a photographer and he had given him a card with the name â€œDuncanâ€ � on the reverse .
The prosecution put it to him that he phoned this â€œDuncanâ€ � years later and that this was the paperâ€ ™ s royal editor , undermining his claim the previous day that he had responded to an advert from a national paper .
Hardy has been charged with misconduct in public office , while Larcombe has been charged with aiding and abetting him .
Both deny the charges .
Hardy said he had been under pressure at the time of his first account , he had misremembered what had happened and may even have claimed the card said â€œDuncanâ€ � because he was so angry about being arrested .
â€œI think it was someone else , the reason â€ “
I was bitter and twisted that Duncan Larcombe and the Sun had put my information out ; that they had promised they would have kept confidential.â€ �
This , the jury heard , was a reference to the management standards committee disclosing internal emails to the police investigating allegations of wrongdoing at the paper and its sister title the News of the World .
Asked about his defence case statement he said he had phoned the person on the card in 2004 and asked him if he knew if he could get any work as a photographer as he was studying the craft .
He told jurors he was in debt to the tune of Â£15,000 to Â£20,000 when he started at Sandhurst in 2004 and because army pay of Â£24,000 a year was so low , he always needed a second job to make ends meet .
He remembered asking the photographer â€œDuncanâ€ � if he had any information about his trade or if he knew of any work as a security guard as he had worked in security at the Daily Mail building in 2000 .
â€œThis
[ the date of the defence case statement ] was a year after I had been arrested .
I hadnâ€
™ t been served the files , I was trying to remember , I was trying to get some work
and I couldnâ€
™ t get work .
â€œIs
it distorted this ?
Yes it is .
Is it what I thought was true at the time ?
Yes , â€ � he told jurors .
Hardy told jurors the payments he received from the paper were â€œeasy moneyâ€ � .
He said he couldnâ€ ™ t remember what he got his first payment for in February 2006 , as he didnâ€ ™ t think he had given them any information .
The trial continues ."
2015-02-26,"A Sandhurst instructor told his wife that Â£4,000 the Sun newspaper paid him for a picture of Prince William in a bikini had come from a gambling win , a court has heard .
John Hardy , a colour sergeant at the military academy , asked his wife Claire to pick up the bonanza at a Thomas Cook outlet in Slough in June 2006 .
He was in Australia at the time and told her the jackpot was from the bookies .
He is on trial over allegations he received more than Â£23,000 for titbits about Prince William , Prince Harry and others between 2006 and 2008 .
Jurors heard that the Â£4,000 was described in News Internationalâ€ ™ s books as a payment for â€œPrince William wearing a bikini exclusiveâ€ � and was to be collected by â€œClaire Hardyâ€ � .
Hardy had left Sandhurst at the time but had continued contact with the paperâ€ ™ s royal editor , Duncan Larcombe .
The retired soldier told jurors previously that he had â€œfabricated a storyâ€ � to suggest he could have got hold of a photo of the prince dressed as a Bond girl in order to get the cash in advance for the picture .
â€œJohn called me to tell me to pick up some money that he said heâ€ ™ d won in Australia , â€ � his wife said .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t remember if he told me how much .
I remember it was a large amount of money.â€ �
She said her husband instructed her to take the money to HM Supplies in Camberley to pay off a bill for boots for cadets at Sandhurst .
Hardy said she remembered going there and speaking to an older woman who was â€œgrumpyâ€ � because she was closing the shop and wanted to go home .
She recalled there was woman who was â€œolder , small build and very grumpyâ€ � in the shop .
Hardy remembered she â€œthe Â£4,000 did go up on the counterâ€ � and that she got a receipt , but the shop did not have a record of this transaction nine years on .
Prosecutor Mark Bryant - Heron put it to her that she and her husband â€œconcoctedâ€ � this â€œfalse
accountâ€ � of supplying boots to Sandhurst to conceal the fact he was actually brokering a deal with someone else for the Prince William photo .
â€œThe reason youâ€ ™ ve alighted on this [ cover story ] was you thought they did not have records going back that far , â€ � he said .
She said the shop told her they had no records but she had a distinct recollection of telling the shopkeeper she had the money for her husband .
â€œWhen
I said John Hardy she knew exactly what that was ,
â€ � she added .
Bryant - Heron put it to her that the truth was â€œMr
Hardy has brokered a deal for the provision of the photo.â€ �
She replied â€œIt was notâ€ � .
In his evidence , Hardy told jurors he had never seen a photo of Prince William in a bikini but he had led Larcombe to believe he could get one and asked for payment in advance .
She denied ever knowing that her husband was selling information to the Sun or that he was using her bank account for payments from the paper .
She has been charged with aiding and abetting the alleged crime by allowing her bank account to be used to funnel some of the payments .
She said she did not read the Sun and did not know what News International was until the day of her arrest .
She said she did not notice the words â€œNews Internationalâ€ � in her bank statement .
Jurors heard she used telephone banking and would generally call her bank to pay bills or to check her balance .
â€œDid he ever tell you at any stage during this period of 2006 to 2008 that he would be paid money by News International or by the Sun for information that he was supplying them?â€ � she was asked by her counsel .
â€œNever , â€ � she replied .
She said she did not give News International her bank account details and did not know Larcombe before this trial started in January .
â€œDid you read the Sun ?
â€œ
she was asked by her counsel .
â€œNo , itâ€ ™ s not my thing â€ “ sport and lady parts are not my thing , â€ � she said .
â€œIf you had seen the words News International back in 2006 would you have made a connection between these words and the Sun newspaper?â€ � her counsel said .
â€œNo , â€ � she replied .
She denied telling police in her home on the morning of her arrest that she knew what her husband had been up to .
A police note , signed by her at the time , said she made the â€œunsolicited commentâ€ � that â€œI know the money from them went into my bank
account.â€
�
Police have testified that she said this while sitting on the sofa and talking to one of the officers .
She told jurors that what she said was â€œI know he did work for a newspaper.â€ �
In reference to a second job he had at the Daily Mail in the past , she said the officer had said something about a newspaper in conversation .
â€œThat triggered off a memory that John did some work for papers , he did the Daily Mail thing.â€
�
Hardy said she was â€œstunned , shocked , and scaredâ€ � when the police arrived at her house in a dawn raid and that one of the police officers sat with her on the settee â€œtrying to put me at my easeâ€ � , â€œI didnâ€ ™ t talk to him at all
and just then he sat forward and said â€˜Come on , you must have realised they were going to come knocking ,
â€ �
she said .
â€œHe was just saying things like â€˜you must have knownâ€ ™
.â€ �
Asked if she knew if it was â€œright , wrong or indifferent for that officer to have the sort of conversationâ€
�
, she replied : â€œI think he was trying to calm me.â€ � .
Fighting back tears , she agreed that her husband had always supported her and their daughter Olivia .
â€œYou donâ€
™ t need much to be happy , â€ �
she said .
She said her husband never discussed work with her .
â€œHe went to work , came back â€
“
it was just a job ,
â€ � she said .
The trial continues ."
2015-02-27,"The owner of an army supplies shop in Surrey has told a court she was never paid Â£4,000 in cash for army boots for Sandhurst cadets , contradicting evidence at the centre of a trial relating to leaks about Prince William to the Sun .
Carmel Bond , who runs HM Supplies in Camberley , Surrey , said she would have remembered if someone came in to her shop with Â£4,000 in cash and to the best of her memory this did not happen .
She was called as a rebuttal witness at the Old Bailey trial of Sandhurst instructor John Hardy who has been charged with misconduct in public office over leaks to the Sun about Prince William and Prince Harry during their time at Sandhurst .
His wife Claire has been charged with aiding and abetting her husband for funnelling some of the 34 payments from the Sun .
Hardy received Â£4,000 in cash from the Sun in June 2006 after he persuaded the paperâ€ ™ s royal editor that he could get hold of a picture of Prince William dressed in a bikini at a James Bond fancy dress party .
His wife testified on Thursday that she picked up the money at a Thomas Cook branch and took it to HM Supplies to pay for a consignment of army boots ordered by her husband .
She said her husband had phoned her from Australia where he was on duty and told her he had got the cash from a gambling windfall .
He had instructed her to collect the cash and take to HM Supplies to pay off a bill .
Bond said she was visited by the Metropolitan police earlier this year and asked about a customer called John Hardy or Claire Hardy .
â€œThe name was not known to me ,
â€ � she said .
â€œIf you received an order for boots to the value of Â£4,000 would that be from your point of view a large or a small order?â€ � asked prosecutor Michael Parroy QC .
â€œIt would be a large order , yes , we wouldnâ€ ™ t even have the stock for that ,
â€ � she replied .
â€œIf someone paid you Â£4,000 in cash would you know about it?â€ � â€œI would , yes , I would.â€ � â€œTo
the best of your memory has ever anybody paid you Â£4,000 in cash for boots?â€ � â€œNo.â€ �
On Thursday , Claire Hardy testified that she put the Â£4,000 on the counter of the shop
and she recalled a grumpy older woman serving her .
She said she got a receipt for the money and did not question why her husband would be spending Â£4,000 in the shop .
Jurors heard the shop she runs with her husband is close to the entrance of Sandhurst .
She said that at the time cadets , who could afford to , would upgrade their boots and buy â€œlower mountain bootsâ€ � which cost between Â£140 and Â£150 each .
Counsel for John Hardy put it to her that bulk discounts were given to platoons at Sandhurst at her shop .
She replied : â€œNo.â€ � â€œWe wouldnâ€ ™ t give credit of Â£4,000 to anybody like that other than an official purchase , â€ �
she replied .
â€œIâ€ ™ m going to suggest to you there was a sergeant at Sandhurst , John Hardy .
Three times a year platoons graduates , there was a sergeant at Sandhurst John Hardy who had an arrangement to make a bulk order of boots and those would be supplied to cadets towards the end of their training , â€ � said Simon Csoka QC for Hardy .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t know about that .
I donâ€
™ t know how that happened , â€ � she replied .
â€œIâ€
™ m not suggesting it was done by Sandhurst itself but on an individual basis by Mr Hardy
, â€ � said Csoka .
â€œWell , youâ€ ™
d remember if you saw 40 pair of boots in one go and how the order was processed , â€ � she replied .
Csaka continued : â€˜That you would lend Mr Hardy several pairs of boots different sizes so the cadets would know what size would fit them.â€ � â€œNo.â€ � â€œAnd he would return those and give you an order.â€ � â€œNo.â€ �
She agreed that there were no records for 2006 to cover all sales and that it was possible
she did not remember Claire Hardy coming into the shop because of the passage of time .
Both John Hardy and Claire Hardy deny the charges .
The trial continues on Tuesday ."
2015-02-27,"In Africa a blood drenched war on wildlife is raging and next month Prince William is going behind enemy lines .
This is a man with a passionate mastery of a bleak situation .
While others understandably genuflect to Chinaâ€ ™ s tumescent economic power , with tongues out for crumbs , his is a higher purpose .
There are at most 500,000 elephants left in Africa and the prince will be taking their desperate plight to the political elite , which by an egregious sin of omission is complicit in the slaughter and foreseeable demise of Loxodonta africana .
Chinese investment in Africa has transformed economies , lifted millions out of poverty and provided hope for nations ravaged by war , corruption or sheer destitution , but there is a quid pro quo .
The continentâ€ ™ s forests are being emptied and the savannahs cleared of wildlife .
For too many , an encounter with majestic beauty isnâ€ ™ t a precious moment ; itâ€ ™ s a precious ornament .
This is reminiscent of European attitudes in the 19th and early 20th centuries , save for the fact that the hideous King Leopold II of Belgium didnâ€ ™ t have helicopter gunships , Kalashnikovs and night vision goggles nor was his barbarism feeding an ever more ravenous $ 10tn ( Â£6.5tn ) consumer economy .
Tempting as it must be , William is in no position to give it the full Ron Reagan â€ “ â€œMr President .
Tear down those carving factoriesâ€ � .
This has to be sotto voce diplomatic egg - shell walking .
The elephant in the room is a domestic ivory ban as soon as possible â€ “ but he knows we canâ€ ™ t point fingers , we can only cross them .
Hopefully William has been taking tea with clever sinologists for hints on negotiating labyrinthine and convoluted cultural complexities .
His every step will be attended by party apparatchiks associated with the murky business , â€˜impartialâ€ ™ officials and traditionalists with inner voices crying â€˜Western cultural imperialismâ€ � .
Lots of smiles will be needed then , and all to a soundtrack of assurance and platitude .
The road to this wretched oblivion has been a self - fulfilling catastrophe .
The futures market is slavering as ivory is hoarded for when there is no longer an elephant future .
Capitalism may well be the worst system , apart from all the others , but that is not good .
This long road , now littered with rotting carcasses , took a fateful turn in 2008 when the powers that decide , British government included , agreed a one - off sale of over 100 tonnes of ivory to China and Japan , to â€œflood the market , satisfy demand , provide funds for elephant conservation and reduce poachingâ€ � .
The sale price was just over $ 150 a kilo .
However , in China , the party drip - fed ivory into the domestic market , driving the price up to over $ 1,000 a kilo and pushing the illegal price today to nearly $ 3,000 a kilo .
Any first year economics students nursing the mightiest hangover could have worked out that scenario .
Elephants are intelligent , complex and self - aware beings and the moral case against ivory is unanswerable .
When it comes to elephants we are shamed as a species .
Mugabeâ€ ™ s thugs have just stolen dozens of young elephants from the wild to sell to the ghastliness of Chinese zoos .
You can hear our shame in the mothersâ€ ™ calls as the herds edge as near as they dare to the heavily guarded holding pens in Hwange national park .
You see it in the youngster guarding his mother after her face has been hacked off and as Will Travers from the Born Free Foundation told me - you can smell it on your shirt for days .
Anthropomorphism isnâ€ ™ t the problem here , itâ€ ™ s anthropocentrism .
Itâ€ ™ s all about us .
Itâ€ ™ s all about the price of everything and the value of the next consignment of ivory smuggled out of Mombassa .
Oh , and hereâ€ ™ s a few gorilla hands for your designer ashtray business .
The prince is clearly driven by outrage and revulsion .
John Kerry has called the trade â€œhistorically shamefulâ€ � .
The image of poaching can conjure up a couple of Dickensian ruffians hauling a stag over the moor .
The reality of this industrialised slaughter is unspeakable .
Look online and then try not to look away .
Over the last years weâ€ ™ ve had many frustrating meetings in the corridors of power .
There are politicians who in the current vernacular â€œget itâ€
�
but others who are , shall we say , less evolved .
The former foreign secretary William Hague is impressively attuned to this issue , hence
that departmentâ€ ™ s previous engagement with it .
Hague raised it at the highest level of the Chinese leadership , to their surprise .
Douglas Alexander and also Mary Creagh and Justine Greening have keen grasps of the security implications , the links to terrorist funding and international crime dimensions but for many others itâ€ ™ s â€˜so whatâ€ ™ .
Batting for British business comes first and this comes nowhere .
Chatting to Jeremy Hunt outside a radio studio recently , he told me how queasy he felt at one particularly ornate gift he received at his wedding in China .
Ditto a million weddings and a million carvings for the jeunesse dorÃ
© e in their whirlwinds of confetti .
Ivory is said to bring you good fortune .
The aspirant and opulent cherish its beauty but what a terrible beauty .
Good luck , sweet prince ."
2015-03-04,"The Duke of Cambridge has condemned the trade in illegal wildlife as a â€œvicious form of criminalityâ€ � and said that China can be a global leader in the fight against it in a speech on the last day of his visit to China .
Speaking at the Xishuangbanna Elephant Sanctuary in Yunnan Province , Prince William said : â€œit is appalling that elephants - and many others - may be extinct in the wild in our lifetimesâ€ � .
The extinction of elephants and other animals such as rhinos and pangolins would be â€œan immeasurable loss to the whole of humanity , â€ � he said .
The prince said the illegal trade in wildlife , just like pollution and climate change , â€œrecognise[d ] no bordersâ€ � .
He said it is a â€œcommon enemyâ€ � that â€œerodes the rule of law , fuels conflict , and may even fund terrorismâ€ � .
The prince has been campaigning to save endangered animals for several years and in December he mentioned in a speech how in China the wholesale price of ivory had increased from $ 5 ( Â£3 ) to $ 2,100 per kilogram in 25 years and poaching has increased as a result .
Today he praised China for its â€œcontribution to the protection of wildlife in Africaâ€ �
but he said that there is much more to be done including reducing the demand for products made from endangered animals .
â€œDemand provides traffickers with their incentive .
It fuels their greed , and generates their vast profits , â€ � he said .
China has come under fire from conservationists who say that its huge appetite for ivory has fuelled poaching to a level that it threatens the existence of elephants in parts of Africa .
Ivory has become a popular luxury item among Chinaâ€ ™ s wealthy .
Praising the one - year ban on the import of ivory carvings implemented last week in China , the prince said such steps are â€œwelcomeâ€ � and would help to ensure that the legal trade could not be used as a front to launder illegal ivory products .
Chinaâ€ ™ s
State Administration of Forestry declared the ban last Thursday with immediate effect in a public notice posted on its official site , in which it said the administration would not handle any import request .
William said he had discussed the efforts China is making during his meeting with president Xi Jinping on Monday , who told him of Chinaâ€ ™ s â€œintention to do moreâ€ � .
The prince met with conservationists during his visit to the sanctuary and fed a rescued elephant named Ran Ran .
He also met with the local Dai community who live side by side with wild elephants .
In a reference to Chinaâ€ ™ s challenge to balance GDP growth with environmental protection the prince said that all countries â€œexperience the tension between the need to develop resources for the good of all , and the responsibility to preserve natureâ€ � and that this is a â€œdifficult balanceâ€ � .
The two can not be separated , he added , and long - term economic stability requires â€œsustainable development green growthâ€ � .
The prince features on a billboard campaign in China along with David Beckham and Chinese celebrities such as former basketball player Yao Ming and actress Li Bingbing that aims reduce demand for ivory .
During the Princeâ€ ™ s visit , he also featured on a television campaign being aired across the country and on the worldâ€ ™ s largest video screen on the facade of the Citi Tower on the waterfront of Shanghaiâ€ ™ s iconic Bund .
WildAid , the organisation behind the campaign , said that consumer awareness in China of the impact of the trade in ivory and rhino horn has grown rapidly over the past two years .
Reports released this week by WildAid found that 95 % of those surveyed agree the Chinese government should impose a ban on the ivory trade .
They also found that 70.6 % believe elephant poaching is a problem , compared with 46.6 % in 2012 .
The princeâ€ ™ s first visit to China has been the highest profile royal visit to the country in 30 years since the Queenâ€ ™ s tour in 1986 .
He has made a better impression than his father , who famously described Chinese officials as â€œappalling old waxworksâ€ � in a leaked diary at the time of the Hong Kong handover in 1997 .
The prince kicked off his four - day visit in Beijing where he met Xi Jinping in the Great Hall of the People and presented the president with an official invitation from the Queen for a state visit later this year .
They discussed a number of topics including their shared interest in football .
The visit has also been used to promote British business ties with China .
In Shanghai , the prince opened the GREAT Festival of Creativity that aims to create jobs by supporting UK companies looking to break into Chinese markets .
Partnerships between the UK and China in film , TV , healthcare and tourism were announced at the festival , and the prince met with business leaders including Jack Ma of Alibaba , the richest man in China .
To mark football being added to the national school curriculum , the prince joined a football master class with coaches who are trained by the Premier League at the Nanyang High School in Shanghai .
There was also time for a little light relief on Tuesday when took to the red carpet with another famous British figure , Paddington Bear , for the China premiere of the movie"
2015-03-04,"As The Duke of Cambridgeâ€ ™ s convoy made its way through the stunning hills and valleys that typify Yunnan Province in China , the tropical heat was climbing and the contrasts with Shanghai were striking .
Chinaâ€ ™ s relentless economic growth is self evident in Beijing and its big cities but it is reassuring that there are still parts of this vast country which remain relatively unspoilt .
Yunnan covers 4 % of Chinaâ€ ™ s land , but boasts 60 % of its species and the Prince chose to end his China tour by visiting Elephant Valley in the Xishuangbanna Forest Nature Reserve .
His aim was to focus on one of his great passions â€ “ conservation of Africaâ€ ™ s wildlife .
It is a subject that he is well versed in having spent a great deal of time in Africa - a part of the world that he cares deeply about .
His China visit has given him the chance to see conservation work in the region but , more importantly , the chance to meet president Xi Jinping , with whom the delicate issue of the illegal wildlife trade and Chinaâ€ ™ s consumption of ivory and rhino horn was openly discussed on Monday .
Having spent the first two days successfully promoting political , trade and cultural links , his final day has been all about seeing , listening , and learning of the conservation challenges faced in this part of the world .
Conservation is ultimately about people .
The prince knows this well from witnessing firsthand community programmes funded by Tusk in Africa .
So it was no surprise that for his first engagement at a Dai village he took great interest in the problems faced by this rural community protecting their crops from Chinaâ€ ™ s 250 remaining elephants living in the neighbouring reserve .
It strikes me that coming to see Chinaâ€ ™ s last remnant population of elephant is highly symbolic .
Are we witnessing what Africa might be like in a decade or two if the slaughter of its elephants continues unchecked ?
The irony is that in a country where demand for ivory is pushing Africaâ€ ™ s elephants to the brink , here in Yunnan the Chinese State Forestry Administration is proud of their efforts to protect and slowly increase the population again .
And if to emphasize the point , as part of the visit , the prince was introduced to a habituated elephant , Ran Ran , which had been found and rescued by 80 villagers having been caught in a huge iron trap .
The prince clearly enjoyed meeting a group of young conservation students eager to ensure that theirs is not the last to see wild elephants in China .
Throughout the trip there was real evidence that Chinaâ€ ™ s youth is increasingly becoming engaged in promoting conservation and concerned with pollution and climate change .
Later in the day , the prince spoke passionately at a regional conservation conference about the brutal reality of an illicit trade now estimated to be worth $ 20bn a year to the criminal syndicates who exploit it .
â€œIt is a vicious form of criminality : plundering the natural resources of poorer countries , taking lives , hindering development and spreading corruption .
It erodes the rule of law , fuels conflict , and may even fund terrorism , â€ � he said .
However , he was also careful to applaud the Chinese leadership for banning shark fin soup from the menu of all state banquets â€ “ a move that has seen a 70 % reduction in the devastating shark fin market and he clearly wanted to encourage more .
â€œWe have to conserve our planet â€ “ to provide security and prosperity for all people , and indeed to sustain humanity , â€ � he continued .
â€œThe extinction of animals such as elephants , rhinos and pangolins would be an immeasurable loss to the whole of humanity , â€ �
In concluding , the prince encouraged China to become â€œa global leader in the fight against the illegal wildlife tradeâ€ � and adding , â€œno tradition or fashion is worth the extinction of an entire species , and no criminal gang should be allowed to destroy any part of nature.â€
�
The fact that this 32-year old prince has been able to eloquently raise and discuss this issue at the highest possible level with both the presidents of America and China within just four months is an extraordinary achievement and illustrates his unquestionable commitment to the cause .
As he returns to London , the question that the conservation world now waits to see is whether China will indeed take the next step of banning the ivory trade outright ."
2015-03-05,"The Sunâ€ ™ s royal editorâ€ ™ s life was â€œtorn to piecesâ€
� when he was arrested in relation to an alleged criminal offence he didnâ€ ™ t even know existed , a court has heard .
Duncan Larcombe was suspended from the profession he loved and was good at and had waited three years to put his version of events , his barrister told jurors the Old Bailey .
Reports he wrote about Prince Harry and Prince William at Sandhurst were all in the public interest and he simply requested payments for an instructor at the military school who offered assistance because that is what the Sun does , pays for stories , jurors were told .
Larcombe is on trial for allegedly aiding and abetting colour sergeant John Hardy , who has been charged with misconduct in public office for leaking information to the Sun for cash .
The jury were told Larcombe was a â€œserious heavyweight journalist with ethics and morals which he appliesâ€
�
, that there was not a single complaint from the royal palace or the princes about this stories and all he wanted to do
was show they were not getting favourable treatment at Sandhurst .
They were reminded by his counsel , Richard Kovalevsky , that he had started work at the Sun in 2001 and had resigned twice because of disagreements with management .
The first time was when he refused to go into a brothel to investigate a story about an MP and a rent boy .
The second time was when he went to cover the tsunami in Thailand and discovered a hitherto unknown village affected by the tidal wave .
â€œThere were bodies everywhere , in the sea , in the fields , all over the place , thousands of bodies , and he wrote copy on it and submitted it .
Copy wasnâ€ ™ t taken up .
He was asked to write something about a minor celebrity who had got injured .
He resigned , â€ �
Kovalevsky told jurors .
â€œThe man you are trying is a serious heavyweight journalist with ethics and morals which he applies , â€ � he added .
â€œWhen you judge Duncan Larcombe , this is of course a man who has now waited nearly three years since his life was pretty much torn to pieces by a knock on the door , an arrest , for a trial for an offence he had never heard , which he had never been alerted was wrong .
â€œ[He was ] taken away from a profession at which he was very good at and loved and essentially taken away from his life , waiting so that he could sit before you in a court , be it in the Old Bailey or anywhere and give you his true account , â€ � said Kovalevsky .
He reminded the the jury that Larcombe had said he was no criminal â€ “ he had said .
â€œI
didnâ€
™ t go into journalist to become a criminal , I hope this court appreciates I am not
a criminal.â€ �
Kovalevesky said the words had â€œweightâ€ � and should be borne in mind in deliberations .
He added that the prosecution had said in its closing speech that each of the defendants in the case had been â€œless than truthfulâ€ � .
He said Larcombe had â€œa right to feel pretty upset about thatâ€ � particularly when a series of palace officials and former officials had lined up to testify about the good working relationship he had with them as royal editor of the paper .
He reminded them of Larcombeâ€ ™ s testimony in which he explained how he applied his personal code of ethics .
He had pulled away from an island off Mozambique when he was asked to report on Prince Harry and Chelsy Davy .
He did the same at Klosters to allow Prince William and Kate Middleton privacy while skiing and reported to police photographs of the royal couple on holidays which he suspected to have been stolen .
The trial continues tomorrow with the closing speech for John Hardy , the colour sergeant and his wife Claire Hardy , who has also been charged with aiding and abetting her husband ."

2015-03-09,"The jury has gone out to deliberate on its verdicts in the trial of four senior Sun journalists who have been on trial for the past two months over allegations of payments to public officials for tips and leaks .
They will also be considering the case of a former Sandhurst instructor who leaked stories to the Sun about Prince Harry and Prince William and his wife whose bank account was used to funnel some of payments .
After eight weeks hearing the evidence , the judge , Mr Justice Saunders told them to â€œstrive to reach verdicts on which you are all agreedâ€ � , telling them they can not reach majority verdicts unless so directed .
In his summing - up , Saunders described another public official accused of selling stories to the Sun as like a â€œmole from a John Le CarrÃ
© novelâ€
� .
The Sun chief reporter John Kay , 71 , is accused of paying the Ministry of Defence offical Bettina Jordan - Barber Â£100,000 for stories while she was working as a strategy officer at the MoD and briefed the defence secretary .
The stories including reports about bullying at the Deepcut barracks , shortages of equipment and resources in Iraq and Afghanistan , and breaches of the officersâ€ ™ code of conduct .
Sun executive editor Fergus Shanahan , 60 , and deputy editor Geoffrey Webster , 55 , who are also on trial allegedly authorised the payments to the public official .
â€œMost of the facts are not in dispute as far as Mr Kay and the prosecution are concerned , â€ � Saunders added .
â€œYou may think Bettina Jordan - Barber agreed to become John Kayâ€ ™ s eyes and ears in the MoD.â€ �
He added that â€ � â€ ™ if we were in a John Le CarrÃ
© novel
she would be called a moleâ€ � .
Saunders said Kay did â€œa good deal less work and enquiry than it would otherwise require if he were not getting information from Bettina Jordan - Barberâ€ � .
He told the jury that she was not a â€œtypical whistleblowerâ€ ™ â€ � and used the MPsâ€ ™ expenses scandal as an example .
â€œCould John Kay really have thought that it was OK for someone in the MoD to bypass the system in giving information to him?â€ �
Saunders continued .
â€œHe did not operate on the basis that if you are paying a public official then there needs to be a higher public interest threshold.â€ �
He added that Kay is an â€œextremely distinguished
journalistâ€ � who was â€œplaced on a pedestal by other reportersâ€ � .
The judge said that the Sun has run a number of campaigns supporting the military .
â€œThere is no doubt that the Sun achieved a great deal for the armed forces , â€ � he added .
Saunders said that the MoD always released details of soldiers killed in combat .
â€œThe advantage to the Sun in paying Bettina Jordan - Barber for the information was to scoop its rivals , â€ � he added .
â€œThey got a dayâ€ ™ s lead on them essentially .
â€œThe prosecution say there was no public interest in reporting deaths before the MoD because it was all going to be released anyway , â€ � he added .
The judge continued there is â€œno disputeâ€ � that revealing military equipment shortages is in the public interest .
He added that the Sunâ€ ™ s campaign about bullying in the army was â€œobviouslyâ€ � something the public should know about .
Saunders told the jurors that they have to balance the MoDâ€ ™ s policy for not naming officers under investigation and public interest .
â€œThere is nothing illegal in publishing allegations but when people read it they are going to think itâ€ ™ s true , â€ � he added .
The judge continued : â€œYou have to consider the stories and what was paid for them .
â€œYou have to consider Bettina Jordan - Barberâ€ ™ s position and consider whether you are sure there was no reasonable excuse or that there was a reasonable excuse , namely that the MoD would be burying the stories
otherwise.â€ �
Webster and Shanahan both claim that the reason they were asked to approve the cash payments was budgetary .
â€œThe editor of the Sun is a powerful and busy person , would he or she really be expected to check whether they were paying the right amount of cash to a contributor?â€ �
Saunders said .
He added that it was â€œperfectly acceptableâ€ � for humour to be used in a headlines , even when the story is about a serious issue .
The Sunâ€ ™ s royal editor Duncan Larcombe , 39 , is also accused of paying ex - Sandhurst colour sergeant John Hardy , 44 , for details about the army base where Prince Harry trained .
Hardy funnelled some of the 34 payments totalling Â£23,000 through his 41-year - old wife Claire , the Old Bailey has heard .
He was paid for stories relating to the members of the royal family between February 2006 and October 2008 , it is said .
One story at the centre of the case relates to a purported picture of Prince William in a green bikini .
The judge told jurors that the accounts of Larcombe and Hardy differed on the photograph .
Larcombe emailed his boss to say he knew the name of the source of the photos , while Hardy claims the photo
didnâ€
™ t exist and he just asked for Â£4,000 in advance to get the cash .
He said he used the cash to buy army boots for cadets in Sandhurst and asked his wife to take the money to HM Supplies shop in Camberley , Surrey .
Saunders reminded the jury that the shopkeeper had no recollection of this although she accepted the events were nine years ago and she had said she may not remember everything from that long ago .
No such photo ever appeared in the Sun .
All defendants deny all the charges ."
2015-03-12,"Two weeks ago , the Chinese government announced a one - year suspension on imports of carved ivory products from Africa .
The move was seen as largely symbolic , a token action designed to head off the criticism the government expected from Prince William on his visit to China the following week .
But it is a hopeful sign that the Chinese authorities are sensitive to the international outcry over the countryâ€ ™ s role in fuelling demand for poached ivory , and its complicity in the massacre of elephants currently taking place all over Africa .
In response to international pressure , governments in China and Hong Kong are also taking action to destroy ivory stockpiles .
By the end of June , Hong Kong will have destroyed 30 tonnes of illegal ivory â€ “ one of the largest commitments seen anywhere .
However conservationists insist that the only way to smash Chinese demand for illegal ivory is by shutting down the legal domestic ivory trade , and thus depriving business to the workshops that turn smuggled ivory into consumer products .
While today in Kenya you may receive a fine of KSh 20 million ( Â£142,000 ) or earn life in prison for possessing a single ivory product , in China you can freely carry around a whole polished tusk .
In fact 83 % of middle and upper income Chinese surveyed in 2013 by National Geographic said they were planning to buy ivory products .
The legal ivory trade in China is supposedly restricted to ivory from historical stockpiles that existed before the CITES ( Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ) ban came into force in 1976 , or from the one - off sale of 60 tonnes of ivory in 2008 .
China flatly denies it , but there is no doubt in the minds of experts and conservationists that the legal ivory trade is simply a cover for thriving black market in poached ivory .
This black market fuels demand and keeps prices high , and drives the ongoing decimation of Africaâ€ ™ s elephant populations .
Most ivory smuggled into China from Africa arrives at the port of Hong Kong , which is reputed to be the worldâ€ ™ s largest market for ivory .
Last month Richard Leakey and I travelled to Hong Kong to find out for ourselves what could be done to reduce the demand for ivory .
Over the course of five days , we spoke to more than 3,000 people , including government officials , the media , school children , the business community and conservation charities .
We gave lectures , held meetings , and I even visited ivory shops .
Before visiting a state school for boys , I was warned that the boys would be boisterous and likely to be distracted .
In fact they sat in silence and listened carefully .
Unlike pupils at other schools we visited , these 15-year - old boys did not cry or express horror at seeing pictures of dead elephants .
But when they saw a bonfire of ivory they all screamed in shock .
At the end , when I invited the boys to help us with solutions , they were very shy about speaking up in English .
But afterwards a boy came to me and made a suggestion I had never heard before .
He told me that ivory is coveted in China because of its whiteness : the whiter it is , the more valuable it is .
â€œWhy
donâ€
™ t we stain it and make it ugly?â€
� he suggested .
This would help prevent government stockpiles from ending up in the traffickersâ€ ™ hands .
He had no idea how this could be done but was ready to go and figure it out .
This wild out - of - the - box thinking is the magic of young people and why I love speaking to them .
With young people on our side we will find ways to be beat the traffickers .
But right now , the scale of the problem is huge , and unfathomable .
According to Alex Hofford of Wild Aid , 25.3 million containers enter Hong Kong seaport annually , and only 1 % of these are checked .
47 million tourists from China visited Hong Kong in 2014 .
For many of these visitors , the main purpose of their trip is shopping for luxury goods , including ivory .
Despite aggressive awareness campaigns , the trade in ivory is booming .
Legal ivory products , i.e. antiques , are supposed to be authenticated by certificates issued by CITES .
Reports suggest that forging of these certificates makes it impossible for consumers to distinguish legal from illegal ivory .
I went to two ivory shops to find out for myself .
Richard Leakey would not accompany me as he said it would depress him .
The shelves in the shops were stacked with small and medium carvings , jewellery and cheaply made figurines .
In one shop , I found carvings of African women , clearly from Africa .
The shop assistant confirmed that the sculptures were produced in Africa , and that he had imported them from London .
He had a CITES certificate verifying that he imported the pieces in December 2014 and that the sculptures were pre-1920 , which would make them pre - convention and perfectly legal .
I feigned deep interest in a carving made by my ancestors , and offered to buy it to take it back to London .
He was aghast and warned me that I could not take it out of Hong Kong despite the â€˜officialâ€ ™ CITES permit .
My personal assessment was that the carving was more likely from recent ivory .
I suspected the same of many of the raw tusks and other carvings in his shop .
These were not works of ancient art ; they were not even beautiful .
These were mass produced pieces including jewellery , carvings of Buddhist and Christian religious icons and , ironically , miniature elephants .
I asked if I could buy earrings or chopsticks as gifts for friends , saying that I would hide them in my suitcase and smuggle them into London .
Again the trader aggressively warned me against it and said I would get caught and arrested .
When I asked what the penalty would be , he said he had no idea .
The government officials we met were polite , extremely serious , and a pleasure to talk to .
But we were surprised to hear that many of them knew virtually nothing about the role that Hong Kong plays in the international ivory trafficking and slaughter of elephants in Africa .
Once they understood the problem , they were keen to help .
In one meeting , a Hong Kong official asked Dr Leakey : â€œWhat can we do to move the Hong Kong Government to ban ivory trade ?
How can we move the people to support it?â€ �
Leakey responded that it is all about changing attitudes .
When we left Kenya , we had been told that reducing the demand for ivory in China and Hong Kong would be nigh impossible due to its strong cultural roots .
The culture is strong , but that does not mean it can not change .
China has abandoned many cultural beliefs and attitudes , for example towards slavery , foot binding and the rights of women .
Japanese attitudes towards ivory were changed in the 1980s as the country became more integrated into the international community , and the same can happen in China .
Dr Leakey is convinced that he can help fast - track this attitude change through the voice of Brad Pitt , who will be playing him in the bio epic â€˜Africaâ€ ™ , to be directed by Angelina Jolie and due to be released in 2016 .
According to Leakey , â€œThe film can change behaviour because it shows a love affair with elephants .
It will allow Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie to say what needs to be said and to influence hundreds of millions of people .
In buying ivory , the Chinese people may not be directly killing elephants , but by not buying ivory they can directly help to stop the killing.â€ �
The film will also give African conservationists the opportunity to build links with the growing environmental movement in China , to create grassroots alliances that can keep up the pressure on the government once memory of the film fades .
We were well received everywhere we went in Hong Kong , as were my colleagues Christopher Kiarie and Resson Kantai on their visit to mainland China last year .
The most positive message from our visit is that China is open to new ideas ."
2015-03-26,"What happened when Prince William , David Cameron and David Beckham were holed up together in a Swiss hotel during Englandâ€ ™ s unsuccessful bid to host the 2018 World Cup ?
That is the question posed by William Gaminara in this funny and inventive farce : the only problem is that ongoing allegations about vote - rigging inside world footballâ€ ™ s governing body , Fifa , make it a look a bit dated .
But the main joke rests on the interaction between three public figures as they prepare to put their case to the all - powerful voters .
In Gaminaraâ€ ™ s version , Prince William is an instinctive practical joker and David Beckham a guileless innocent in thrall to a wife angling for an invitation to the forthcoming royal wedding .
But the sharpest portrait is of Cameron , who has all the gung - ho enthusiasm of one of natureâ€ ™ s PR men , until things start to go against him : once thwarted , either by the loss of Prince Williamâ€ ™ s trousers or the even more serious fiasco of Englandâ€ ™ s failed Â£20 m bid , he turns into the blustering , brick - red figure familiar to all students of prime ministerâ€ ™ s questions .
Dugald Bruce - Lockhart catches precisely Cameronâ€ ™ s tendency , when cornered , to turn into a bullying Flashman and wriggles convincingly when asked to distinguish between a bribe and an incentive .
SÃ © an Browne also offers an uncannily accurate impersonation of David Beckham , Tom Davey is an endearingly chumpish William and Ravi Aujla doubles neatly as a suspiciously obliging hotel attendant and his bungling twin .
It is all directed with great pace by Philip Wilson and offers plenty of laughs : I just feel that , on this occasion , Englandâ€ ™ s failure can not be attributed entirely to personality clashes or our own native incompetence .

2015-05-02,"The Duchess of Cambridge has been admitted to hospital for the birth of her second child .
Kensington Palace confirmed she was admitted to the private Lindo Wing of St Maryâ€ ™ s hospital , west London , in the early hours of Saturday .
The duchess and her husband , Prince William , do not know whether they are having a boy or a girl .
The child will be the Queenâ€ ™ s fifth great - grandchild and the fourth in line to the throne .
The birth will be overseen by a medical team led by Guy Thorpe - Beeston , surgeon - gynaecologist to the royal household .
Alan Farthing , surgeon gynaecologist to the Queen , will assist .
Both medics were present at the birth of the Cambridgesâ€ ™ first child , Prince George , in July 2013 .
Kensington Palace said : â€œHer royal highness the Duchess of Cambridge was admitted at 0600hrs to St Maryâ€ ™ s hospital , Paddington , London and is in the early stages of labour .
â€œThe duchess travelled by car from Kensington Palace to the Lindo Wing at St Maryâ€ ™ s hospital with the Duke of Cambridge.â€
�
The palace said â€œlabour is progressing as normalâ€ � .
The Duchess is believed to be around one week overdue .
Eager to avoid the media circus that surrounded Prince Georgeâ€ ™ s birth , the media were prevented from setting up camp outside the hospital until the official announcement that the duchess had been admitted .
News of the birth will be announced publicly only after the Queen and other close family members have been informed .
Aides are then expected to make public thhe sex and weight of the child , as well as the time of the birth .
Details will given via official Twitter accounts before a more formal announcement is later placed on an easel outside Buckingham Palace .
William , who is training to be an air ambulance pilot , has been no more than two hoursâ€ ™ drive from the hospital in the latter stages of his wifeâ€ ™ s pregnancy , working from bases in Norwich , Cambridge and Gloucestershire .
The duchess will be given 10 % off the Lindo Wingâ€ ™ s pricey fees as part of a loyalty discount to mothers who return to have a second child .
Prices have increased since George was delivered in 2013 ; a suite of two rooms now costs Â£6,570 for a one - night stay with a normal delivery .
In addition , there are consultant fees of about Â£6,000 .
Parking restrictions outside the hospitalâ€ ™ s entrance were imposed from 16 April in anticipation of media interest .
Television crews , photographers and journalists have been discouraged from camping out around the clock as they did before Georgeâ€ ™ s birth .
But such is the interest from global media organisations that barriers have again been erected outside the hospital to contain correspondents and photographers .
Royal sources have indicated that , after the birth , the couple intend to spend a few days at their London residence in Kensington Palace before decamping to Anmer Hall on the Queenâ€ ™ s Sandringham estate in Norfolk .
Bookmakers have long been taking bets on names for the child , with Alice , Elizabeth , Charlotte and Victoria all popular if it is a girl , and James , Arthur and Alexander if it is a boy .
Recent changes to the laws governing succession mean that if it is a girl , for the first time it will remain ahead of any younger brother in the line of succession .
If the baby is a girl , she will be the first female born to the British royal family to take the title princess for 25 years and will also be the highest ranking female in line to the throne .
A girl has not been born this high up the line of succession for nearly 65 years , since Princess Anne was born .
There has not been a Princess of Cambridge born for 182 years , the last being George IIIâ€ ™ s granddaughter Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge , who was born in Hanover , Germany , in 1833 ."
2015-05-02,"Prince William and I were born 9 months apart , about half way back to the founding of the NHS .
I could do a trite little line here .
â€œThe world was a different place back then ,
â€ �
I could quip , â€œwhen the Russians were threatening Europe and the media followed every moment of a royal princessâ€ ™ s pregnancy and all the music sounded like it was from the â€˜80s.â€
�
It would be hilarious but tragically wrong , because it really was a different place .
A September baby , I was born into the cold and dark of one of the most brutal winters ever seen in Britain .
In the Midlands , temperatures plummeted to an astonishing ( for England ) -25.2C.
The River Severn iced over , while commuters were trapped on trains when the doors froze solid .
William missed all that because his parents planned better , but he had another big problem to contend with , a problem called â€˜being born in the nineteen eighties.â€ ™
The ONS have a handy graph that illustrates this vividly .
In 2011 , 4.2 children out of every thousand died before their first birthdays .
In 1981 , the year I was born , that figure was over 11 .
In fact even in 1997 , rates were almost 50 % higher than they are now .
People often talk about medical advances as if they all happened in the 1960s , and we switched overnight from some flea - ridden Victorian hell - hole to the modern world we know today , but even now weâ€ ™ re making astonishing advances .
So things are getting better .
The small wrinkly proto - Royal that just emerged from the national womb will have thrice the chance of surviving that her father and I did , just through the privilege of being born in 2015 .
But if that makes you feel all warm and complacent , there are a couple of big problems with this story .
While itâ€ ™ s true that things are getting better , theyâ€ ™ re still not good enough .
Our babies are considerably more likely to die than those born in countries like Spain , Italy , France or basically any other European nation you can think of .
By 2010 , weâ€ ™ d just about caught up with Japanâ€ ¦ in 1985 .
The picture is just as grim for childhood deaths , where we rank behind just about every Western nation on a level with Serbia and Poland , with twice the rate of Iceland .
To the extent that you can ever judge a nation by a single metric , child mortality is the one to pick .
The death of a child implies so much else that has to have gone wrong first , from education , welfare and health to alcohol abuse and economic inequality , that it acts as a kind of litmus test for the health of our society .
Weâ€ ™ re failing that test .
Exceptâ€ ¦
thatâ€ ™ s not actually true either .
Thereâ€ ™ s a simple statistical adjustment you can do that brings Britainâ€ ™ s infant and child mortality rates back into line with the rest of Europeâ€ ™ s , reducing the rate by a third and putting us level again with countries like France and Germany .
Can you guess what it is ?
Get rid of the poor people .
Especially northerners .
If you live in the South East , or youâ€ ™ re in the top half of the socio - economic scale , then youâ€ ™ ve won the evolutionary lottery .
By sheer accident of birth you can enjoy watching only 3.9 babies die for every 6.1 that depart the West Midlands for the great wet nurse in the sky .
If youâ€ ™ re rich , only 3.6 of your babies die for every 4.8 the poor folk lose .
If youâ€ ™ re rich and a southerner , then congratulations , you have literally won life .
Itâ€ ™ s tempting to make this a party political issue , but the causes are complicated and they deserve more than knee - jerk name - calling .
So do the children involved , who arenâ€ ™ t abstract numbers but real kids dying at a rate of thousands a year .
The National Childrenâ€ ™ s Bureau made the point in a recent report that : â€œIf the UK had the same all - cause mortality rate for children under 14 years as Sweden we could have nearly 2,000 fewer deaths among children in that age group per year - five fewer
childrenâ€ ™ s deaths per day.â€
�
How do we address that ?
Well there are several things a government can do , and they boil down to this .
Protect our strong system of primary health care , and raise standards of mental health treatment .
Ensure that poorer families received adequate support .
Treat alcohol and drug abuse .
Above all , reduce inequality in our society .
As the NCB put it , â€œPoverty kills children .
Equity saves lives.â€ �
In fact Iâ€ ™ ll leave you with their concluding words : â€œThat children in the UK may die unnecessarily should be a matter of national shame .
As child health advocates , professionals , and policy makers , we have a duty to act urgently to improve the life chances of our children.â€ �
So , on Thursday , do you .

2015-05-04,"The birth of a new royal baby always stirs up all manner of fantasies and wild stories , but thereâ€ ™ s a new one doing the rounds that really takes the biscuit , if not quite the crown .
The US gossip supermarket rag Globe has published a story about how Prince William is not , in fact , his parentsâ€ ™ firstborn child .
There was an elder sister , apparently , the result of in vitro shenanigans that happened during Princess Dianaâ€ ™ s pre - wedding gynaecological check - up .
Eggs were extracted and fertilised with Prince Charlesâ€ ™ s sperm to ensure that pregnancy between the two lovebirds was technically possible .
One of the resulting embryos somehow found its way inside the womb of the wife of one of the attending doctors .
33-year - old â€œSarahâ€ �
â€ “ or perhaps that should be â€œPrincess
Sarahâ€ �
â€ “ is now living incognito in the States .
Here in a nutshell , or a test tube , is the contemporary version of all those old stories about royal heirs being smuggled in or out of the royal bedchamber inside a warming pan .
The best - known occurred in 1688 , when crypto - Catholic James II was rumoured to have introduced a male baby into his wifeâ€ ™ s birthing chamber to replace a stillborn child .
In 1688 the constitutional stakes were sky high .
This was the moment when Britain might return to the Roman Catholic fold , or carry on with its idiosyncratic brand of nationalistic Protestantism .
And itâ€ ™ s this note of jeopardy that Globe insists on injecting into its story about â€œSarahâ€ � .
The magazine maintains that , following the Succession to the Crown Act of 2013 , which allows an older sister to rank above her younger brothers , â€œSarahâ€ � is actually Prince Charlesâ€ ™ first heir , ahead of William .
This is all wrong â€ “ the act only applies to babies born after 28 October 2011 .
Still , the need to believe that there might be a pretender to the British throne runs so deep and strong that it seems almost churlish to mention that , even if Globe can actually produce â€œSarahâ€ � ( so far thereâ€ ™ s just a badly Photoshopped picture ) , it has created a storm in a commemorative royal teacup .
Popular royal history abounds with phantom babies and lost children who have a habit of popping up at moments of social and political instability .
The republican movement of the early 1870s , which looked for a while as though it might topple the British throne , came up with a baby story for Queen Victoria and John Brown that continues to be revived every three years or so .
Currently , thereâ€ ™ s a 60-year - old accountant from Jersey called Robert Brown who is fighting to prove that he is Princess Margaretâ€ ™ s illegitimate child , possibly by Robin Douglas - Home .
Brownâ€ ™ s documentary evidence for his claim may be patchy , yet he doesnâ€ ™ t come over as either mad or a fantasist .
Rather , he argues that his lifelong sense of feeling unloved can only be accounted for by the fact that some royal sleight of hand attended his birth in 1955 .
He explained that his mother , a former house model for the royal dressmaker Hardy Amies , was distant towards him in comparison to the way she treated his siblings .
Sometimes his birthday was forgotten and his parents never talked about his birth .
And here , surely , we have stumbled across the powerful , inexhaustible , archaic driving power for all these phantom royal baby stories .
Where is the person who did not grow up feeling different from their peers , set apart , the odd one out ?
And where is the child who does not at some point fantasise that she must have been swapped at birth ?
Her real parents could not possibly be the ordinary , disappointing mortals who share her name but who , now she comes to think about it , donâ€ ™ t really look very like her at all .
Someone more important must be waiting in the wings with her true birth certificate .
Freud had a name for this wishful thinking â€ “ the family romance â€ “ and called it â€œone of the most necessary yet one of the most painfulâ€ � phases through which all children must pass .
And most of us do , most of the time .
But being a grown - up is a difficult business , especially shorn of the consoling fantasies that all of us build at one time or another .
Even if we are too sensible to imagine that we are the offspring of royalty , then please at least allow us the proxy fantasy that somewhere out in the world â€œPrincess Sarahâ€ � is waiting to meet her new baby niece ."
2015-05-20,"David Cameronâ€ ™ s
former communications chief Andy Coulson knew phone hacking was going on at the News of the World while he was editor , a former senior reporter on the paper has told a court .
Clive Goodman , the paperâ€ ™ s former royal editor , claimed Coulson agreed to pay Â£500 a week to a private investigator to hack the phones of members of the royal household , including aides to Prince Harry and Prince William .
The 57-year - old from Surrey was called as a prosecution witness on the second day of the perjury trial of Coulson , who is alleged to have lied about his knowledge of phone hacking in a trial four years ago .
He told how he discovered Prince Harry had asked an aide to help him on an essay he had been set at Sandhurst about the 1980 Iranian embassy siege from hacking the royal staff memberâ€ ™ s voicemail .
Goodman said that Coulson had seen the transcript of the voicemail , which was hacked in 2005 .
â€œHe had seen the transcript
so he knew what was in the voicemail
, so he knew that to be accurate , â€ � said Goodman , in reference to the story .
Goodman told the high court in Edinburgh how he was initially introduced to a man called Glenn , who was hacking phones in a bid to get stories by his boss on the paperâ€ ™ s newsdesk .
Goodman told the court on Wednesday : â€œWhen I first met Glenn , as I knew him , I had worked out he was an inquiry agent and private detective .
Iâ€ ™
d worked out he could crack stories very quickly , stories that he cracked had something to do with communications.â€ �
Goodmanâ€ ™ s news editor
, Greg Miskiw told him the manâ€ ™
s
full name was Glenn Mulcaire and that he had been eavesdropping on the voicemails of people who were of interest to the paper .
â€œEventually Greg told me what had actually happened : they were doing something , they had been hacking phones , â€ � said Goodman , who added that this was taking place around 2004 - 2005 .
Coulson has pleaded not guilty to perjury in the trial of Tommy Sheridan in 2010 , when he was asked about his knowledge of phone hacking .
Goodman said that at the end of October 2005 he went to Coulson to suggest they put Mulcaire on a new contract , worth Â£500 a week , which would allow him to consistently monitor the voicemails of a number of members of the royal household .
He said the meeting took place in Coulsonâ€ ™ s office , where he â€œoutlined the costs , methods , voicemail numbers and pin numbers [ etc]â€ � involved in the proposal .
This would be paid to Mulcaire under the codename â€œAlexanderâ€ � , Goodman said .
Prosecutor Richard Goddard pressed him on his recollection of the meeting and Coulsonâ€ ™ s reaction .
â€œWhen you spoke to Andy Coulson about this project â€ “ monitoring phones , mobile numbers , pin numbers
â€ “
did he seem in the dark about this practice?â€ �
Goddard asked .
â€œI
couldnâ€
™ t say , sorry.â€ �
â€œWhat was his reaction to his proposal?â€ � â€œHe was worried about the cost .
We agreed to do it just for a trial basis and to review it after a month.â€ �
â€œDid he ever worry about the breach of privacy?â€ � â€œThat didnâ€ ™ t come up , â€ � replied Goodman .
Summarising for the jury , Goddard repeated : â€œYou told us that these [ payments ] were for phone - hacking operations that Mr Coulson knew about.â€ � â€œYes , â€ � replied Goodman .
The jury was shown contributor payment request forms that detailed payments made to â€œAlexanderâ€ � from November 2005 to spring 2006 .
Goodman said he also referred to Mulcaire as â€œMateyâ€ � in emails to Coulson .
Jurors were shown an email sent by Goodman to Coulson one month after the â€œAlexanderâ€ � trial period had begun .
â€œAndy
â€ “ got a sec on extending the Matey trial pse ?
Left a memo with B on Wednesday , â€ � Goodman wrote on 25 November 2005 .
Coulson replied :
â€œAnother month.â€ � Mulcaireâ€ ™ s
â€œployâ€ � , as described by Goodman , would produce â€œscraps of informationâ€ � and initially was not successful , he told jurors .
Asked Goddard who was editor at the time , Goodman replied : â€œAndy.â€ � â€œAt the start of all of this
did he know you were accessing voicemails at that time?â€ �
Goddard asked .
â€œNot from me he didnâ€ ™ t , â€ � Goodman said .
â€œHowever , did that change in the months
ahead?â€ � â€œYes it did , â€ � replied Goodman .
The jury were shown texts from Mulcaire to Goodman in the summer of 2006 that Goodman said referred to the phone pins of Kate Middleton â€
“ now the Duchess of Cambridge â€
“ who was Prince Williamsâ€ ™
s
girlfriend at the time .
â€œKate :
2689â€ � , read one sent on 9 June .
â€œKate :
1243 really need result on that story , â€ � said another text on 23 June .
Goddard also asked Goodman about the atmosphere in the newsroom .
He claimed Coulson had erupted in a fit of rage on one occasion when he told his boss that he could not travel to the US to cover a royal tour by Prince Charles because of childcare issues .
â€œHe was very angry , he kicked the desk , â€ �
Goodman told jurors .
â€œIt was a very scorching dressing - down from the man who ran the paper and it didnâ€ ™ t really end there.â€
�
He said one particular news editor on the paper treated him aggressively .
â€œHe once told me :
â€˜If itâ€ ™ s not the big story , itâ€ ™ s the Big Issue , Clive , â€ ™ in relation to the homelessness [ magazine],â€ � said Goodman .
Another senior journalist on the paper , who can not be named for legal reasons , changed the atmosphere in the newsroom for the worse when he was hired .
â€œThe paper became much more fractious .
It had always been a very competitive place to work but it was now hyper - competitive , â€ � said Goodman .
He described this journalist as â€œvery aggressive , abrasiveâ€ � .
â€œSome found it very unpleasant , â€ � said Goodman .
The trial continues ."
2015-05-22,"The former royal editor of the News of the World has told a court he is â€œnot the slightest bit proudâ€
� of hacking the phones of princes William and Harry .
Clive Goodman , 57 , said â€œnobody seems to let me move onâ€
� , speaking of the period of his life when he regularly listened into the royalsâ€ ™ voicemails in the hunt for a scoop to impress his editor .
He also claimed he regretted hacking the voicemails of Kate Middleton when she was dating Prince William in 2005 and 2006 , including once on Christmas Day .
Goodman was giving evidence for the third day during the perjury trial of his former editor Andy Coulson in Edinburghâ€
™ s high court .
Records of phone calls prepared by police for the trial showed he hacked the now Duchess of Cambridgeâ€ ™ s phone 155 times , including on 25 December 2005 .
â€œI hacked Kate Middletonâ€ ™ s phone just to see if there was a message from Prince William , â€ �
he said when asked what he was doing on Christmas Day by Coulsonâ€ ™ s barrister Murdo Macleod QC .
Asked how he felt about hacking the phones of the royals , Goodman told the court : â€œNow , it feels very wrong .
Iâ€ ™ ve had plenty of time to reflect on this , itâ€ ™ s not something Iâ€
™ m proud of , not the greatest move of my career .
Iâ€ ™ d dearly love to be able to move on but nobody seems to let me move on .
We still seem to be discussing it nine years
on.â€
�
When it was put to him that there were 155 hacks of Middletonâ€ ™ s phone he said :
â€œI donâ€ ™ t deny any of this ;
itâ€ ™ s there , I did it .
I wish I hadnâ€ ™ t
but I canâ€
™ t take it back.â€
�
Coulson is on trial after being charged with committing perjury for allegedly lying about his knowledge of hacking in the 2010 perjury trial of the former Scottish politician Tommy Sheridan .
He denies the charge .
Goodman , of Surrey , who was jailed in 2007 along with private investigator Glenn Mulcaire for hacking royal aidesâ€ ™ phones , was repeatedly accused by Macleod of lying when giving evidence .
During the second day of tense cross - examination , Coulsonâ€ ™ s barrister put it to him that he was â€œnot telling the whole
truthâ€ � when he testified earlier this week that Coulson knew he and Mulcaire were hacking the royals .
Macleod accused Goodman of bearing a grudge against Coulson after emails showed he was unhappy with being put under pressure to bring in bigger and better stories .
In one email shown to the jury , Goodman told his sister Fran â€ “ who also worked on the paper
â€ “ that he felt like hitting him in a way â€œthat would have pushed his larynx out the back of his neckâ€ � .
â€œIt was an exaggerated bitch about the boss .
Itâ€ ™ s simply a turn of phrase , â€ � Goodman told jurors , saying there was never any violence between them .
Goodman had told jurors that Coulson sanctioned a Â£500-a - week deal with Mulcaire to hack phones of royal aides even though he was already on a contract for more than Â£100,000 a year with the tabloid .
He claimed he had the conversation in Coulsonâ€ ™ s office and outlined the targets of the hacking and the results it might yield .
Macleod put it to him that this was not a credible version of events .
â€œIf you told him that this was from someone who was already on Â£100,000 and you told him this chap was already hacking , would he not have said , â€˜Whatâ€ ™ s the point?â€ ™ if he was being paid that much?â€ � Nodding towards Coulson , Goodman replied : â€œYouâ€ ™
d have to ask your client.â€ �
He added : â€œThere was a small value to be wrenched out of this on a special project and , quite frankly , Â£500 a week , it wasnâ€ ™ t a considerable sum for a newspaper of this size.â€ �
Macleod responded : â€œThe truth is you never mentioned hacking to Mr Coulson at all.â€ � â€œThatâ€ ™ s not true , â€ � replied Goodman .
On re - examination by prosecutor Richard Goddard on Friday , Goodman said he did not bear any grudge now against Coulson .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t bear Andy any personal animosity , but he did behave badly , â€ � he said .
Goodman said he did not want to give evidence but was advised he was compelled to do so under Scottish law .
He told the court : â€œI would much rather be at home with my family getting on with my life and not having to relive this nightmare over and over again .
â€œI find myself having to recall phone hacking years and years after Iâ€ ™ ve served my sentence â€ ¦ and being labelled the rogue reporter [ by News International ] , with the full weight of News International bearing down.â€ �
The trial continues ."
2015-05-30,"Finally , here come Arsenal , the 2015 FA Cup champions !
They climb the famous Wembley steps , faces beaming , and Aston Villa fan Prince William - slightly grim - faced , it has to be said - hands the trophy to Per Mertesacker and Alexis Sanchez .
Up goes the cup , and down comes the ticker tape !
Arsenalâ€ ™ s win means Southampton are in Europe , with Liverpool going straight into the Europa League group stage .
But never mind all that ; this is about Arsenal , and especially Arsene Wenger , their manager becoming a bona fide FA Cup legend today .
As if he wasnâ€ ™ t one already , but a joint - record sixth win really hammers home the point , no ?
Over to Daniel Taylor , then , for the big matchâ€ ™ s big report ...
An understandably upset young Villa fan is letting it all out , a few tears rolling down his cheeks .
But then he spots himself on the big screen at Wembley , and allows himself a shy , but very brave , smile .
A little something to take away from his very disappointing day .
Hey , maybe thereâ€ ™ s something in training the camera on the fans after all .
Villa trudge up to claim their runners - up medals .
A line of depressed faces , their managerâ€ ™ s the most miserable of all , his heart beating away on that sleeve .
It wonâ€ ™ t feel like it now , but Sherwoodâ€ ™ s done a fine job so far at Villa , getting the team to the final , obviously , but keeping the team in the Premier League too .
Next season should be interesting at Villa Park , and itâ€ ™ s been a while since anyoneâ€
™ s said that .
Wenger speaks !
â€œWe have shown today that we are a real team .
Iâ€ ™
d like to congratulate everyone , my players , my staff , the supporters .
The confidence is good and the spirit in the team is high .
I am proud that our club is doing well , and if I can personally do well , thatâ€ ™ s even better!â€ �
A cheeky smile .
How long does he plan to continue in the job ?
â€œMy hunger is great , I want to do well .
I will sit down with my directors and see how much they trust.â€
�
Tim Sherwood wanders onto the pitch , hands in pockets , a picture of misery and despair .
His opposing number Arsene Wenger is walking on air , and who can blame him ?
This is a remarkable achievement by Wenger , who has turned Arsenal into the kings of the FA Cup .
Villaâ€ ™ s players stand , hands on hips , thoroughly defeated .
They never really got a foothold in this final , and were well beaten by a very good team .
A four - goal thrashing doesnâ€ ™ t flatter Arsenal at all .
Arsenal are the 2015 FA Cup winners !
Theyâ€ ™ ve retained their trophy , and with their 12th win , become the most successful FA Cup club of all time !
Arsene Wenger meanwhile registers his sixth win , a stunning personal record he shares with George Ramsay of ... Aston Villa .
This is a historic day all right !
The final humiliation .
Oxlade - Chamberlain finds a bit of space down the right , fires a low ball towards the near post , and Giroud flicks into the bottom right .
Shades of offside , but what does it matter ?
90 min + 2 : Grealish , who hasnâ€ ™ t stopped , pitching - wedges a diagonal ball from the left into the Arsenal box , but Benteke canâ€ ™ t get on the end of it .
90 min + 1 :
Sanchez dribbles into a little space down the left , but his cross into the Arsenal box is aimless .
Thereâ€ ™ s
nobody in there anyway .
Benteke has been very disappointing , though I guess heâ€ ™ s not had much to feed on .
90 min : There will be three minutes of added time .
A mere 180 seconds , and itâ€ ™ ll seem like 180 years to poor Villa .
89 min : Sanchez is replaced by Oxlade - Chamberlain , a move which allows Arsenalâ€ ™ s fans to give their star man the reception he deserves .
They donâ€ ™ t disappoint .
87 min : Grealish , in a fit of frustration , attempts a snapshot from 25 yards .
Justice would have seen that fly into the top corner , but itâ€ ™ s easily blocked .
Itâ€ ™ s not been Villaâ€ ™ s day .
Theyâ€ ™ ve been outplayed comprehensively , though theyâ€ ™ ll point to those two late non - decisions .
85 min : Grealish robs Bellerin down the left , tight on the byline .
And then heâ€ ™ s sent crashing to the floor !
A penalty ?
Nope , theyâ€ ™ re not getting that one , either .
Thatâ€ ™ s not a good decision either .
Bellerin had his arm on his shoulder .
It wasnâ€ ™ t the hardest of tugs , but that shouldnâ€ ™ t make any difference .
On the touchline , Tim Sherwoodâ€ ™ s eyebrows nearly snap clean off his face , so fierce is his frown .
84 min :
The free - kick - cum - corner comes to naught .
83 min :
Giroud twists and turns by the right - hand corner flag , and is sent crashing to the floor by Vlaar .
That was more clumsy than anything else .
But a free kick thatâ€ ™ s effectively a corner .
82 min :
Agbonlahor is booked for continuing to debate that decision in the trenchant fashion .
80 min :
Agbonlahor turns on the jets and heads towards the Arsenal box down the left .
Heâ€ ™ s about to take a step into the area when heâ€ ™ s upended by a sliding Coquelin .
He claims a penalty , though it should be a free kick just outside the area .
He gets neither decision , though .
He looks aggrieved , and you canâ€ ™ t blame him .
79 min : Sanchez slips a perfectly weighted pass down the left , but Monreal canâ€ ™ t control in the area and Villa hoick clear .
â€œFor the second time theyâ€ ™ ve cut away to show a young Villa fan looking depressed , â€ � reports Dave Hill .
â€œEvery year , there are scenes of kids in tears as their team is relegated .
Iâ€ ™ m wondering if there is a fine line of bringing your impressionable child to a sporting event where their team may be thumped .
On one hand , if they win , it will be one of the greatest things in their lives .
On the other , the soul crushing that can occur , may cause an unexpected rise in top - four team duvet sales.â€ �
Iâ€ ™ m not a fan of the TV cameras homing in on misery in the stands at all , really , whatever the age of the supporter .
People pay good money to go to the game , they shouldnâ€ ™ t be humiliated on the international stage as a symbol of failure just because their team is doing badly and theyâ€ ™ ve got a face on .
Leave people to grieve in peace !
77 min :
Thatâ€ ™ s
Walcottâ€ ™ s last contribution to the match .
Heâ€ ™ s replaced by Giroud , while Ozil is swapped for Wilshere .
76 min : Ramsey , in space down the right , curls a long ball towards Walcott , racing down the left channel .
He looks to curl one into the top right from distance , but his effort is all wrong .
It flies high and wide right .
74 min : We have two teams here , and both know what time it is .
A sense that everyoneâ€ ™ s just running down the clock .
72 min :
Sanchez ( A ) tackles a dithering Sanchez ( C ) in the centre circle .
That was harrying of Suarezian proportions !
And Arsenal are 3 - 0 up and cruising .
Hey , maybe thatâ€ ™ s why Arsenal are 3 - 0 up and cruising .
71 min :
Carlos Sanchez comes on for Westwood .
70 min :
Walcott very nearly springs clear down the right , but heâ€ ™ s offside .
Villa look spent , and miserable to a man .
1957 was a long time ago .
68 min : Richardson , injured it would appear , is replaced by Bacuna .
Hutton moves over to left back .
â€œHow long until Hutton is sent off for a two - footed tackle?â€ � wonders Gordon Inglis , working off Ruth Purdueâ€ ™ s blueprint .
67 min :
Delph slides a clever pass down the inside - right channel , but Cleverley canâ€ ™ t control as he bursts into the area , and Bellerin mops up .
Down the other end , Sanchez twists and turns down the left , but canâ€ ™ t release Ozil .
65 min :
A free kick for Villa down the right .
Delph lumps it into the area , but Szczesny claims with a yawn .
They need something now , if not sooner , but
letâ€ ™ s be realistic , this has gone .
64 min : On the touchline , Tim Sherwood responded to his teamâ€ ™ s non - existent defending by flinging his arms into the air in impotent frustration .
Heâ€
™ s now pinching the bridge of his nose , presumably to keep himself calm .
If nothing else , the manâ€ ™ s box office .
This was as simple as it comes .
Corner for Arsenal down the right .
Cazorla curls it into the box .
Mertesacker rises , and carefully plants a header into the top - left corner , via a brush off his left shoulder .
Benteke was marking him there , but gave up .
Awful defending .
Mertesacker had all the time in the world .
61 min : Ozil rakes a lovely pass down the middle to release Walcott .
Or not quite .
A combination of Okore and Given , on the edge of his box , stop the lightning - quick Walcott wriggle free .
He canâ€
™ t get a shot on goal .
So close to the third goal thatâ€ ™ d put this game to bed .
59 min :
Villa canâ€ ™ t string two passes together right now .
Arsenal are very comfortable .
Hereâ€ ™ s Matt Dony on Alexis Sanchez :
â€œA tenacious , skilful , hard - working South American with a foot like a traction engine and a knack for rising to the occasion , who was available last summer .
That all sounds familiar .
And Rodgers bought Balotelli.â€
�
57 min :
Villa are all over the shop right now .
Bellerin makes good down the right and slips the ball inside for Cazorla , who twinkles his toes to make a little space by the right of the D , before hammering a shot towards the bottom right .
Given parries clear .
This could get ugly for Villa if they donâ€ ™ t clear their heads soon .
56 min : Sanchez has the ball in the net again , but itâ€ ™ s correctly ruled out for offside .
Ramsey had whipped a cross in from the right .
Walcott had mistimed his move in the centre , and though his intervention saw the ball break right past a flapping Given to Sanchez , who headed into the empty net , itâ€ ™ s not counting .
55 min :
Sanchez is the second Chilean to score in an FA Cup final .
George Robledo of Newcastle United was the first , notching the winner in 1952 against ... Arsenal .
53 min : Before the free kick , Nâ€ ™ Zogbia is replaced by Agbonlahor .
Too late ?
Cazorlaâ€ ™ s set piece is cleared easily enough , but Arsenal come straight back at Villa , Sanchez breaking into the area down the left .
Heâ€
™ s got options inside , but delays the cross , and a corner will have to do .
The set piece comes to nothing .
Villa are seriously rocking here .
52 min :
Arsenal have their tails up now all right .
Sanchez cuts in from the left wing , and is clipped over by Westwood , who is booked for his trouble .
This will be a free kick in a dangerous position .
Villa had looked dangerous for a split second there , but now theyâ€ ™ re really up against it .
Sanchez , 30 yards out down the inside - left channel , drops a shoulder to move inside , then unleashes a crazy , swerving , rising shot that deceives
Given and whips into the roof of the net !
What a strike !
One of the stunning FA Cup final goals !
Given may get pelters for that , but theyâ€ ™ d be undeserved , for that ball was moving all over the place , off to the left before swerving violently to the left .
48 min : Grealish has a probe down the left , but heâ€ ™ s quickly closed down .
No matter , Villa come again down the right through Hutton , whose long , looping cross confuses Bellerin to the extent that Grealish has the ball at his feet , tight on the byline to the left of goal .
Bellerin recovers his poise , though , and crowds Grealish out .
47 min :
Arsenal are almost immediately on the front foot again .
Ozil makes space down the left .
He feeds Cazorla , who thinks about shooting from the edge of the box , but slips it to his left for Ramsey instead .
Ramsey twists , turns and then shoots , but his shot isnâ€ ™ t up to much , and bounces harmlessly into the arms of Given .
No changes .
â€œAfter watching a half of those really ugly Arsenal kits , I was thinking since the FA cup currently exists as an exercise in nostalgia , why not have the teams play in old retro kits from bygone eras?â€
� wonders Dave Hill .
â€œMajor League Baseball does it all the time and in some cases , does it really well .
Football , like baseball lends itself to doing so as the only changes in kits are esthetic , not functional like hockey , cricket and American Football .
It might be fun to see Villa in a 1887 kit versus Arsenal in a 1930s one go at it .
Make Tim and Arsene wear waistcoats from those era as well , which would ensure against any gilet use.â€ � Half - time advertisement , in a 1957 style : Villa could do with a shot of this stuff .
Tired blood ?
A pint of Geritolâ€ ™ s your only man !
â€œYouâ€ ™ ll feel stronger fast , within seven days or your money back.â€ �
Not entirely sure of the science behind this , and time might be an issue , but anythingâ€ ™ s worth a go right now .
This scoreline is the very least Arsenal deserve .
Theyâ€ ™ ve been utterly dominant .
Villa have been on the ropes pretty much from the get - go .
Better have another read of those motivational messages from the fans .
Because if the second half pans out like the first , this is all over .
Still , thereâ€ ™ s only the one goal in it , and there have been plenty of dramatic turnarounds in the FA Cup final .
Can Villa produce another ?
Weâ€ ™ ll find out soon enough .
No flipping !
45 min + 1 : Thereâ€ ™ ll be two added minutes of this half .
A corner for Arsenal down the right .
Ozil floats one into the centre , and Villa clear without too much fuss .
But they really need to hear this half - time whistle .
44 min : Arsenalâ€ ™
s set piece isnâ€ ™ t up to much .
Villa are happy just to clear their lines right now .
They came from behind here against Liverpool in the semi , of course , but Arsenal are a different proposition .
Theyâ€ ™ ll have to do better than this , though .
Theyâ€ ™ ll need to hold on for the half - time whistle , and regroup .
43 min : Walcott , in hot form right now , one - twos with Ramsey down the right and shapes to shoot from a tight angle .
Richardson slides in to concede a corner .
Itâ€ ™ s not as if this hadnâ€ ™ t been coming .
Monreal is sent into space down the left .
He lifts a cross into the middle .
Sanchez rises above Villaâ€ ™ s unconvincing centre halves , heading back across for Walcott , who enters the area from the left and meets Sanchezâ€ ™ s header with a blistering volley into the net !
38 min : Delph is booked for repeated fouling .
Heâ€
™ s the heart of Villaâ€ ™ s engine room , and now heâ€ ™ ll need to be very careful indeed .
As does Alan Hutton , of course , but whatâ€ ™ s the point asking him to watch his step ?
You might as well shout into a hole in the ground .
36 min :
But then again , you never know .
Richardson curls a cross into the area from the left .
Benteke , on the right - hand edge of the D , flicks delicately down the channel and nearly finds Grealish , breaking into the box .
Just before that , Given came out of his area to head a long Cazorla lump away from the danger zone .
And just after it , Cazorla clatters into Westwood and winds himself .
But heâ€ ™ ll be OK to continue .
34 min : Ruth Purdue ( 4 mins ) wasnâ€ ™ t too far off .
Hutton is quite correctly booked for an awfully late lunge on Sanchez down the left .
What hoodlummery !
The free kickâ€ ™ s lumped into the Villa box .
Corner .
From which thereâ€ ™ s a small melee in the Villa box , Given not totally in control of the situation or his limbs .
Eventually the ballâ€ ™ s wheeched away from danger .
But this surely canâ€ ™ t continue for Villa , who are really on the ropes here .
32 min : A bit of space for Delph down the left .
He swings a high ball into the Arsenal area .
Benteke winds his neck back .
Szczesny comes out to punch , and manages it just about , but doesnâ€ ™ t connect particularly well under pressure from the striker .
Fortunately for Arsenal , the ball doesnâ€ ™ t go anywhere near a claret shirt .
30 min : Bellerin is sent scampering into space down the right by Ramsey .
His cross is poor - he should be causing a lot of trouble - but Grealish fails to clear with purpose .
Ramsey is preparing to break into the box down the same flank when the whistle goes ; heâ€ ™ s handled .
Lucky Villa .
29 min :
Delph drags Sanchez back by the shoulder , the two competing in the centre circle .
He should be booked for that , really , but the Villa captain gets away with it .
28 min : Coquelin plays a cute reverse ball down the right - hand channel , allowing Ramsey to burst into the box .
Heâ€
™ s got Vlaar on his shoulder , and though he gets a shot away , itâ€ ™ s deflected off the defender and wafts softly into the arms of Given .
This is surely just a matter for time for Arsenal .
26 min : More rococo passing moves by Arsenal .
Villa are being pulled this way and
that by Cazorla , Ozil and Sanchez .
Ozil flicks a lazy pass - lazy in the good way - down the right to release Walcott into the area .
Walcottâ€ ™ s a shade offside .
24 min :
Arsenal pass it around quite a lot .
Suddenly Cazorla releases Ozil down the left .
The ballâ€ ™ s fired low into the middle , where Walcott must score from six yards out !
He sidefoots purposefully towards goal , but Richardson slides in desperately , and blocks magnificently !
Thatâ€ ™ s an astonishing challenge , really .
Just superlative last - ditch defending .
22 min :
Ozil snaffles a loose ball in the centre circle , Grealish and Cleverley faffing about .
He flicks it forward for Walcott , and very nearly releases the player into acres of space .
But Vlaar is across to cover quickly .
Villa are living on the edge here .
20 min : Arsenal should be ahead .
Ozil , down the left channel , chips a ball into the middle .
It should be cleared by Vlaar , on the edge of the area , but the defenderâ€ ™ s header is hopeless .
The ball breaks to Ramsey , who is clear , albeit in a small space , just inside the box !
He leans back and wafts a dismal shot over the bar .
Villa were in St Maryâ€ ™ s
Mode there .
Theirs is not a dependable defence .
19 min : A bit of space for Cleverley down the right .
He slips a pass to Nâ€ ™ Zogbia , who cuts inside and takes a shot .
Itâ€ ™ s charged down , the ball ballooning to Benteke on the edge of the D. A chance to take that down , turn , and get a shot away , and he nearly completes that difficult combination , but his control lets him down just before he can cock his leg to shoot .
17 min :
Bellerin makes good down the right , seeing off Richardson with a deft turn , and fires a low ball to the near post .
Ramsey , last yearâ€ ™ s hero , slides in but can only guide the ball into the side netting .
Between those two very good Arsenal chances , Villa won a free kick down their left , but Grealishâ€ ™ s high hoick into the area was claimed with ease by Szczesny .
Arsenal are well on top here , much as everyone expected .
15 min : From the free kick , Cazorla finds Sanchez with a pitching wedge down the left .
Sanchez turns on the edge of the area and chips into the middle , finding the head of Koscielny , who powers an effort towards the top left .
Given looked to be heading the wrong way , but adjusted majestically to batter it out .
What a save !
14 min : The first yellow card of the game goes to Alan Hutton Tom Cleverley .
He can have no complaints , cynically clicking the heels of Monreal as the Arsenal man burst into space down the left channel .
13 min : Richardson makes good down the Villa left , and swings a high ball towards Benteke at the far post .
Szczesny comes off his line to punch clear with purpose .
Round one of what could be a very important duel to the Arsenal keeper .
A decent move by Villa , though , and their first serious attack .
12 min : Ozil clips what might be the worst free kick in the history of association football into the box .
Vlaar heads clear with a yawn .
Arsenal had packed the box then , but Ozil couldnâ€ ™ t get past the first man .
Thatâ€ ™ s awful .
11 min :
Ozil bursts into a bit of space down the inside - left flank .
Cazorla , up for this , takes control and wins a corner off Delph .
The set piece is cleared by Villa , but Cazorla is soon twisting down the left wing again .
He turns Benteke in a tight spot near the byline , to the left of the Villa box .
Foul .
It should be a booking , but referee Jon Moss is in a lenient mood .
This is a free kick in a very dangerous position , though .
8 min :
Sanchez busies himself down the left .
He draws a couple of claret shirts and slides the ball forward for Cazorla , who bursts into the box and fires low and hard into the centre .
Hutton slides in and concedes a corner .
And then thereâ€
™ s another corner , which sees Koscielny rise on the six - yard line , level with the left - hand post .
His header is weak , flying miles wide right , and should have been a lot better .
But Sanchez is looking very lively down that flank .
6 min : It really is a magnificent atmosphere at Wembley .
And folk try to tell us that the FA Cup is dying , an irrelevant nonsense in the modern world .
Aye , right you are .
Westwood betters Ramsey when contesting a high ball in the middle .
Delph takes up possession and slides a lovely pass down the inside - right channel to release Benteke , though the big manâ€ ™ s an inch or two offside .
That was close , though .
Arsenal looked a bit ragged there .
4 min :
Lovely feet from Delph , who creates a bit of space down the Villa right .
The ballâ€ ™ s flung into the area , and Szczesny claims easily enough with Benteke in the vague surrounds .
A decent response by Villa to Arsenalâ€ ™ s electric start .
They canâ€
™ t allow the favourites to dominate early on .
Well , at all , really ,
but you know what I mean .
â€œHutton to get booked first?â€ � wonders Ruth Purdue .
Itâ€ ™ s almost a licence to print money , isnâ€ ™ t it .
2 min : Arsenal quickly grab possession , and Walcott embarks on a skitter down the left .
Okore puts a stop to his gallop .
But Arsenal are on the front foot quickly , Sanchez upended along the same flank by Westwood .
Arsenal pack the box , but the free kick floated into the area is useless , and easily cleared by Villa .
Cazorla returns it long , and Ozil wins a header to find Walcott on the edge of the area , but Walcottâ€ ™ s offside .
A bright start by Arsenal , this .
A blistering atmosphere at Wembley , on a lovely north London day .
Villa get in a pre - match huddle .
Their manager Tim Sherwood sits stony faced but fidgety on the famous bench , a few nerves betraying him .
Coins are tossed , pennants are exchanged , and hands are shaken by the captains Per Mertesacker and Fabian Delph .
And weâ€ ™ re off !
Villa get the ball rolling , Grealish to Cleverley , and Wembley is rocking !
The teams are out !
The players are lined up on the red carpet , and shaking hands with the guest of honour , the thoroughly biased Prince William .
â€œThe BBC coverage brought a tear to the eye with testimony about Alexis SÃ¡nchezâ€ ™ s early life from folk back in Tocopilla , â€ � writes Charles Antaki .
â€œImmediately dried by shot of sumptuous royal palace , and interview with Prince whichever - one - it - is.â€ �
They should have got that other well - heeled Villa fan , David Cameron , on as well .
Youâ€ ™
d have soon started with the waterworks again , either through laughter or despair .
Then thereâ€ ™ s a quick belt of a song hoping Williamâ€ ™ s granny will be saved , a sentiment we can all get on board with .
And thatâ€ ™ s all the pre - match formalities over with !
Weâ€ ™ ll be off in a minute !
This is on ! ! !
Time for the traditional FA Cup final hymn : ğ � „ � Iâ€ ™ m driving so fast that Iâ€ ™ m breakinâ€ ™
the law
Cos I got ta get a snack to Mr Michelmore â ™ ¯ â ™ ­Mr Savileâ€ ™ s waiting for his muesli
And old Harry Secombe wants his pie and peas â ™ ¬â ™ ª ğ � „ �
Abide with me , fast falls the eventide The darkness deepens , Lord with me abide â ™ ¯ â ™ ­When other helpers fail and comforts flee Help of the helpless , O abide with me â ™ ¬â ™ ª Itâ€ ™ s being sung today by a choir made up of 64 fans , the oldest 100 , the youngest 18 , one for each of the clubs in this yearâ€ ™ s third round .
Another lovely touch .
Emotional times at Wembley , with the big match fast approaching and the nerves kicking in .
In the interests of balance , hereâ€ ™ s a picture of Aston Villaâ€ ™ s kit and caboodle .
Their dressing room has been covered in motivational messages from supporters .
No doubt this will be used as a stick to beat Tim Sherwood with , whatever the result , but to hell with the banal David Brent comparisons .
Thatâ€ ™ s a nice touch , isnâ€ ™ t it ?
Spreading the love .
A happy 21st birthday to Inverness Caledonian Thistle !
Theyâ€ ™ ve just won the Scottish Cup in the dayâ€ ™ s other big match .
The cupâ€ ™ s going to the Highlands for the first time !
Theo Walcott is the beneficiary of the big decision Arsene Wenger had to make .
He gets the nod ahead of Olivier Giroud , that hat - trick against West Bromwich Albion on the final day of the season no doubt doing the trick .
As for Aston Villa , Shay Given has won his race for fitness , and plays in an FA Cup final 17 years after starring for Newcastle United against ... Arsenal .
Meanwhile Alan Hutton returns in place of Leandro Bacuna at right back , while Tim Sherwood selects Charles Nâ€ ™ Zogbia ahead of Gabby Agbonlahor .
Not so long to go now !
Arsenal : Szczesny , Bellerin , Mertesacker , Koscielny , Monreal , Coquelin , Cazorla , Ramsey , Ozil , Sanchez , Walcott .
Subs : Ospina , Gibbs , Gabriel , Flamini , Wilshere , Oxlade - Chamberlain , Giroud .
Aston Villa :
Given , Hutton , Vlaar , Okore , Richardson , Westwood , Delph , Cleverley , Grealish , Nâ€ ™ Zogbia , Benteke .
Subs : Guzan , Bacuna , Sinclair , Agbonlahor , Cole , Sanchez , Baker .
Referee :
Jon Moss ( Tyne and Wear ) .
Having banged on for several paragraphs about stuff that happened in the 19th century , itâ€ ™ d be remiss of me not to mention recent head - to - heads .
Theyâ€ ™ re almost certainly nearly as relevant , arenâ€ ™ t they .
Well , itâ€ ™ s not good news for Villa , who lost 8 - 0 on aggregate over the two Premier League meetings this season , 3 - 0 at Villa Park , 5 - 0 at the Emirates .
Arsenal also won the previous meeting between the teams , 2 - 1 at Villa Park in January 2014 .
But there is a little hope for Villa in the one before that , a 3 - 1 win at Arsenal on the opening day of last season , Christian Benteke and Gabby Agbonlahor running riot .
All of this , of course , was before the advent of Tim Sherwood , so we have to assume the cosmic slateâ€ ™ s been wiped clean .
Still plenty of time to kill before the match , the FA having shifted the traditional 3 pm afternoon kick - off back to the early evening .
Fools .
At least thereâ€ ™ s no sponsorship this season .
Enjoy that state of affairs while it lasts .
Youâ€ ™ ve got another 90 , maybe 120 minutes of action .
Bah .
Anyway , my fellow ageing traditionalists : thereâ€ ™ s an upside to all this hanging about , and itâ€ ™ s this :
Memory Lane : FA Cup finals , a picture gallery of finals from days gone by , featuring the trophy stuffed in the luggage rack of a train , Matt Busby with a fag on , and an appearance from pint - sized pop star Tommy Steele ( internet kids ,
ask your grandparents , who can in turn ask theirs ) .
Arsenal have been officially designated as the home team today , though that means very little if weâ€ ™ re being honest .
They lost the toss for choice of kit , and will wear their time - honoured yellow - and - blue number , though in fairness that did them no harm at all in 1971 and 1979 .
They also wore gold , which is yellow isnâ€ ™ t it , in 1950 .
They did however lose wearing yellow in 1978 against Ipswich Town and 1980 against West Ham United .
Tell the truth , they probably donâ€ ™ t care very much .
Villa are unlikely to be worried one way or the other , either .
Theyâ€ ™ ve won 70 percent of the finals theyâ€ ™ ve competed in , and worn their first - choice kit on all but two occasions .
In those two matches - 1887 and 1957 - theyâ€ ™ ve been forced to wear a second - choice stripy number , and lifted the trophy both times .
Meanwhile their first - choice shirt in 2000 wasnâ€ ™ t far off those second - choice efforts , and they lost that one to Chelsea .
So why am I telling you all this irrelevant nonsense ?
Ah , Iâ€ ™ m just killing time .
Itâ€ ™ s a late kick off .
Blame the FA , and their pointless cocking of a snook to tradition .
Arsenalâ€ ™ s FA Cup final history is a more modern affair .
They only made it to the final for the first time in 1927 , by which point Villa had eight appearances to their name , and those six aforementioned wins .
Cardiff City striker Hughie Ferguson , and goalkeeper Dan Lewisâ€ ™ s slippery new shirt , did for Arsenal that day , but theyâ€ ™ ve since more than made up for lost time .
This will be their 19th appearance in a final , a new record which puts them one ahead of Manchester United .
And theyâ€ ™ ve enjoyed the big occasion more often than not .
Their first win was in 1930 , against Huddersfield Town , Herbert Chapman putting his old club to the sword , the worldâ€ ™ s largest airship , the Graf Zeppelin , looming overhead .
Their 1936 win over Sheffield United also had an aviatic flavour , with an â€œarmadaâ€ � of gyrocopters and aeroplanes containing banned film cameramen swirling around overhead , a dispute between Wembley bosses and newsreel firms over broadcast rights having escalated to a farcical degree .
The more things change , and all that .
Arsenalâ€ ™ s next two wins came at the expense of Liverpool .
Alex Forbes did a borderline - legitimate number on Billy Liddell in 1950 , to devastating effect , while Charlie George scored one of the iconic cup - final goals to secure a league - and - cup double in 1971 .
The Gunners triumphed late in the 1979 five - minute final against Manchester United , then won in the last seconds of a 240-minute tussle against Sheffield Wednesday in 1993 .
Cue the Wenger era : wins over Newcastle in 1998 , Southampton in 2002 , Chelsea in 2003 , Manchester United in 2005 , and Hull City last year .
One more for the record books ?
Whyever not .
Villa , then , are a proper old - school FA Cup side .
Crazy to think that theyâ€ ™ d already chalked up six victories before Arsenal had even got to a final .
Their first win came in 1887 , and what a victory it was , 2 - 0 over West Bromwich Albion .
Their outside left , Denny Hodgetts , was a big lad for a winger , while his top lip creaked under the weight of an ostentatiously waxed moustache .
He was also highly skilful , adept at sending the ball spinning this way and that , utilising knowledge of physics picked up playing competitive billiards .
He scored the opening goal in the 1887 final , smacking a shot past a static Baggies keeper Bob Roberts , who had assumed Hodgetts was offside , and therefore didnâ€ ™ t bother trying to make a save .
Oop !
Albion were equally dozy in the 1895 final , as Villa secured their second FA Cup .
Some of their players hadnâ€
™ t even realised the game had started , as Villa flooded forward , leading to a melee in the West Brom box .
Their keeper Joe Reader attempted to hack clear , but the ball hit John Devey on the knee and flew in .
The goal was timed variously between 30 and 39 seconds , and remained the fastest in a final until Louis Saha scored on 25 seconds for Everton against Chelsea in 2009 .
Deveyâ€ ™ s goal is still officially credited to Bob Chatt , the FA taking a flyer with contemporary press reports .
But the Villa team were adamant that Devey had been their accidental hero .
Villa then lost the cup , the trophy being nicked from its temporary display in the window of Birmingham shoemaker William Shillcockâ€ ™ s shop .
It was melted down for coins , some of which were used to purchase pints in a pub owned by the aforementioned Hodgetts .
Small world , eh ?
The thieves also took several pairs of boots and some money from the till , but the wider world didnâ€ ™ t miss the footwear or petty cash so much .
Villaâ€ ™ s third win in the competition came two years later , and it secured a league - and - cup double .
Their 3 - 2 win over Everton is considered to be one of the all - time classic matches , full of attacking verve .
Villa opened the scoring , Everton equalised before taking the lead themselves , then Villa turned it around once more , Jimmy Crabtree scoring the decisive goal just before half - time .
Everton piled on the pressure after the break , but Villa put in one of the great collective defensive shifts to secure English footballâ€ ™ s second double , eight years after Preston North End registered the first .
There wouldnâ€ ™ t be a third until Spurs managed to pull it off 64 years later .
Villa - and Ramsay - won three more Cups , in 1905 , 1913 and 1920 .
And then nothing until 1957 , when Peter McParland flattened Ray Wood , keeper of double - hunting league champions Manchester United , then scored twice to secure Villaâ€ ™ s seventh Cup .
Their record wasnâ€ ™ t matched until 1982 , when Spurs won their seventh trophy , or surpassed until 1991 , when Spurs made it to eight .
Itâ€ ™ s some record
, this , given the bulk of the work was done before the First World War .
Itâ€ ™ s about time they built on it .
Tim Sherwoodâ€ ™ s side are the underdogs today against Arsene Wengerâ€ ™ s holders , but could do worse than listen to what their manager of 1957 , Eric Houghton , said before that yearâ€ ™ s final : â€œWeâ€ ™ ve got Manchester United worried more than they have us .
They are expected to win .
We are not .
So what do we have to lose ?
Itâ€ ™ s always the best outlook to have when you go into a cup final!â€
�
A perfect , off - the - peg team - talk for Sherwood , right there , a lovely historical callback which doesnâ€ ™ t need too much editing for the 2015 edition .
Itâ€ ™ s the FA Cup final ! ! !
And itâ€ ™ s still the biggest game in the English calendar .
Donâ€ ™ t listen to the naysayers , theyâ€ ™ re not worthy of your time .
Anyway , itâ€ ™ s the 134th staging , and whatever happens , itâ€ ™ s guaranteed to have major historical significance .
If Arsenal win today , they become the most successful FA Cup club of all time .
Theyâ€ ™ d have 12 victories to their name , one more than Manchester United .
Theyâ€ ™ d also become just the fourth club in history to have retained the FA Cup on more than one occasion : only Wanderers , Blackburn Rovers and Tottenham Hotspur have pulled off that particular trick to date .
And their manager Arsene Wenger would personally register a sixth triumph , a record
thatâ€ ™ d nudge him ahead of Blackburnâ€ ™ s Thomas Mitchell and Sir Alex Ferguson , and into a share of first place with â€ ¦ ah , but
letâ€ ™ s just leave that hanging for a few seconds .
If Aston Villa prevail , theyâ€ ™ ll join Tottenham Hotspur in third place on the all - time list with eight FA Cup victories , leaving Liverpool and Chelsea behind .
But that isnâ€ ™ t the only thing on their minds .
Because by denying Wenger his record victory , theyâ€ ™ d be defending the unique record of their own man , George Ramsay , who as Villaâ€ ™ s secretary / manager led the club to an astonishing six FA Cup wins between 1887 and 1920 .
He won six league titles , too .
Six championships and six cups !
So thereâ€ ™ s plenty on the line for both teams today .
As if winning the 2015 FA Cup isnâ€ ™ t more than enough in its own right , huh .
Itâ€ ™ s on !
Kick off : The time - honoured , traditional 3 pm 5.30pm ."
2015-07-09,"Englandâ€ ™ s Casey Stoney has dismissed the row over a tweet from the official England FA Twitter account , rejecting suggestions it was sexist .
The tweet , quickly deleted after an online backlash , welcomed the players home by saying : â€œOur Lionesses go back to being mothers , partners and daughters today , but they have taken on another title
â€ “ heroes.â€
�
The message was widely criticised on social media for appearing to portray the players as something other than simply athletes , but the former England captain , speaking at a breakfast reception with Prince William at Kensington Palace , said : â€œI find it incredible that someone would find that sexist .
â€œWhen
I came back to this country was I a mum ?
Yes .
Was I a daughter ?
Yes .
To me it was black and white , just facts , and to be called a hero is amazing.â€ �
Meetings with the Prince , who had last spoken with the England team as they prepared for the tournament at St Georgeâ€ ™ s Park , tend to be relaxed affairs , and his enthusiasm for the womenâ€ ™ s game is appreciated by those in the camp .
He told the players : â€œYou showed the men how to do itâ€ � , and discussed how the public had been behind them while they were away .
â€œYou really gave it your all , and everybody here noticed it â€ “ social media was alive with it ...
What you created as a team , itâ€ ™ s fantastic .
Youâ€ ™ re only going to get bigger and better.â€ �
William joked about his son , Prince George , telling the team : â€œI was going to bring George this morningâ€ � , but the toddler was busy with his toy plane .
The England midfielder Karen Carney said : â€œHe watched all the games and was right behind us .
He just told us that he was immensely proud of what weâ€ ™ d achieved and that we have done the whole country proud with our passion and determination .
Itâ€ ™ s amazing to be here.â€ �
There has been little let - up for Mark Sampsonâ€ ™ s team since they arrived back in England early on Monday morning .
The team travelled to London on Wednesday ahead of their breakfast engagement , which was followed by a training session with local schoolchildren on the Royal Household football pitch as part of the â€œWe Can Playâ€ � initiative to encourage young girls to play football .
â€œA lot of us are still jetlegged to be honest â€ “
I barely know what day it is , â€ � said Carney .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s all just hitting home now , coming here and also seeing peopleâ€ ™ s reactions .
We were quite sheltered out in Canada , especially given the time difference .
To see people tweeting pictures of our names on the back of their shirts , and screensavers of the team on their phones , really says a lot .
â€œItâ€ ™ s nice to hear that we have been an inspiration to people â€ “ that was always our objective
but I donâ€
™ t know if we thought we could achieve it to this extent.â€ �
Some of Carneyâ€ ™ s team - mates were back in training with their clubs on Thursday , with a view to their participation in Womenâ€ ™ s Super League fixtures this Sunday .
Carney will join up with Birmingham City and assess the likelihood of her involvement against Manchester City .
â€œA few of us are still struggling with ongoing things
so weâ€ ™ ll see how it goes ,
â€ � she said .
â€œThe team as a whole decided that we wanted to go ahead with the summer league so weâ€ ™ ll get on with it and Iâ€ ™ m sure we will be fine .
Hopefully the excitement people have will carry into the weekend ; itâ€ ™ ll be interesting to see if it has an impact on the attendances.â€ �
Carney had been troubled by injury before the tournament but made decisive contributions for Sampsonâ€ ™ s heavily - rotated team , scoring in the narrow group stage wins against Mexico and Colombia .
Completing 120 minutes in the third - place match against Germany capped an impressive personal and collective achievement after what could have been an enervating semi - final defeat to Japan .
â€œThe whole journey was a whirlwind , full of highs and lows , â€ � said Carney .
â€œBut to end in the manner we did , beating Germany with a penalty and winning the bronze medal , made it worth everything .
â€œI think what happened to us against Japan brought us all together .
We deserved to go the whole way
but it wasnâ€ ™ t to be
and maybe we were destined to end with a great result against the Germans like that .
We didnâ€ ™ t want to let it slip â€
“ we couldnâ€
™ t finish fourth and come away with nothing .
That thought galvanised us and we kicked on.â€

After the trip to Kensington Palace , the players visited Downing Street to meet David Cameron ."
2015-07-09,"Official photographs taken by the photographer Mario Testino at the christening of Princess Charlotte have been released by Kensington Palace .
The pictures range from a formal family portrait to more intimate images of the infant with her mother , the Duchess of Cambridge , her father , Prince William , and her brother , Prince George .
The photo were taken on Sunday immediately after the baptism at the Church of St Mary Magdalene in Sandringham , Norfolk , which was attended by the Queen .
The ceremony was private , but a nearby paddock was opened for wellwishers to watch the couple leave the church , with the duchess pushing the nine - week - old princess in a vintage pram which the Queen had used for two of her children .
It was the first time the family of four had been seen together in public .
A Kensington Palace spokesman said : â€œThe Duke of Duchess of Cambridge and their whole family had a wonderful day on Sunday and were delighted to share the special occasion with the thousands of people who came to Sandringham .
They are very happy to share these photographs and hope that everyone enjoys them as much as they do.â€ � The group shot , taken in the drawing room of the Queenâ€ ™ s private Norfolk residence , shows Prince William , Prince George , the Duchess of Cambridge holding her daughter and the Queen .
Standing behind are Kateâ€
™ s family
â€ “ her parents , Michael and Carole Middleton , and siblings Pippa and James .
The Prince of Wales , Duchess of Cornwall and Duke of Edinburgh are also in the picture .
Testino , 60 , whose work has been showcased in magazines including Vogue and Vanity Fair , as well as museums and gallery exhibitions , created some of the most striking images of the late Diana , Princess of Wales .
He is a favourite of the royal couple and took their official engagement photographs in 2010 , as well as marking Prince Williamâ€ ™ s 21st and brother Prince Harryâ€ ™ s 20th birthdays .

2015-07-10,"Preparations for a giant Ulster loyalist bonfire have forced the evacuation of families from 52 homes in east Belfast .
The fire and rescue service advised residents in Chobham Street to temporarily leave their properties on Friday because a massive pile of wooden palettes is to be set alight on Sunday , the eve of Ulster loyalismâ€ ™ s most sacred day , the Twelfth .
Bonfires are set on fire to commemorate the beacons lit to let Protestants in Ireland know that Prince William of Orange had landed on the island in the war against the Catholic King James II , which climaxed in the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 .
48 hours before the Chobham Street bonfire is to be ignited , workers from the Housing Executive , Northern Irelandâ€ ™ s public housing body , boarded up 52 homes near the vast wooden structure .
Local unionist politicians attempted to persuade those behind the bonfire to reduce its size but its builders , mainly local youths , refused to back down .
A Housing Executive spokesperson said : â€œWe are assisting the Department for Regional Development in Chobham Street by boarding up the largely private houses on their behalf to assist residents during this difficult time .
â€œApproximately 52 houses in the area will be boarded up , one of which is owned by the Housing Executive .
DRD will recompense the Housing Executive for the cost of this work.â€ �
The East Belfast Ulster Unionist councillor
Jim Rodgers said it was the biggest bonfire he could recall .
â€œThis is a very worrying time for many of the residents , â€ � he said .
â€œThere are four streets which are worrying the fire and rescue service , as well as the Walkway community centre which is voluntarily owned.â€ � Chris Lyttle , an Alliance party member of the Northern Ireland assembly , called on the authorities to take action .
He challenged the minister responsible for regional development , Danny Kennedy , to intervene to make the bonfire safe .
â€œWe are working with people to help them celebrate culture and tradition in a positive manner , but the size and location of this particular bonfire now poses a serious risk to residents , a community centre and a dedicated cycle and walkway ,
â€ � he said .
â€œIt is unacceptable in 2015 that a government department has allowed this bonfire to progress to the stage , where residents are living in fear for the safety of their homes .
The minister for regional development must take action to make the area safe and show greater leadership on this issue.â€ �
Building the bonfire is a rite of passage for many young working class loyalists and Protestants in Northern Ireland .
Housing estates and areas compete with each other to build bigger , more bulkier bonfires each year in the run up to the Twelfth .
The bonfires have become the target of attacks prior to the Twelfth , and nationalist youths recently set one site on fire prematurely with petrol bombs .
Loyalists have accused those responsible for that incident , at Sandy Row in south Belfast , of seeking to further raise sectarian tensions before the marching seasonâ€ ™ s peak .
As 12 July falls on a Sunday , the Protestant Orange Order will hold its demonstrations to commemorate the Battle of the Boyne the following day , as Orangemen prefer not to hold their biggest parades on the Sabbath .
All of the bonfires across Protestant Ulster will be lit at midnight on Sunday ."
2015-07-20,"How much do you reckon Jeremy Corbyn weighs ?
How does he measure up if you compare his looks to Prince Williamâ€ ™ s ?
How stylish would you say Andy Burnham is ?
And , if you had to guess , what kind of product would you say he uses in his hair ?
The answers to these questions do nothing to help us decide who would make a better leader of the Labour party .
But they do influence how voters perceive candidates .
The Mail on Sundayâ€ ™ s profile of leadership candidate Liz Kendall describes her as a â€œslinky brunetteâ€ � and a â€œpower - dressing Blairiteâ€ � with a â€œlithe figureâ€ � who â€œremains New Labour to the tips of her stilettosâ€ � .
The paperâ€ ™ s political editor , Simon Walters , asked if she wants to â€œget married and have kidsâ€ � , quizzed her about her fitness routine and twice compared Kendall to Kate Middleton .
At one point , Walters speculates that â€œshe looks the same weight as the Duchess â€ “ about 8stâ€ � ; later , he disingenuously asks her to discuss â€œthe cruel comments about being a â€˜childless spinsterâ€ ™ â€ � , neither telling readers who made those â€œcruel commentsâ€ � in the first place , or where .
It isnâ€ ™ t the first time in the leadership campaign that the media has treated male and female candidates differently .
After MP Helen Goodman wrote in the Huffington Post that she was backing Yvette Cooper for leadership because Cooper was a fellow parent , there was even more debate about whether or not a prospective leader needs to be a mother .
It goes without saying that the parental status of the male candidates , Burnham and Corbyn , didnâ€ ™ t figure in the discussion .
In fact , Iâ€ ™ d wager most voters could tell you immediately whether or not Cooper and Kendall are parents , with all the attendant stereotypes on both sides , but probably wouldnâ€ ™ t be able to answer the same question for Burnham and Corbyn .
Nor should they , since it is irrelevant to the position for which these politicians are standing .
Sexism in media coverage is nothing new , but it is still alarming that it occurs .
In fact , the comparison to the Duchess of Cambridge isnâ€ ™ t new either ; last year , in the Mailâ€ ™ s routine take on the cabinet reshuffle , its reporters described the newly promoted female MPs as â€œCameronâ€ ™ s cutiesâ€ � and compared both education secretary Nicky Morgan and junior minister Penny Mordaunt to the duchess in their fashion choices .
There is something interesting about the fact that female politicians , particularly as they near positions of power , are so frequently compared to Kate Middleton in the UK press .
Could it be an attempt to neutralise them by pushing them into the only territory the media allows Kate to occupy â€ “ where she is judged on her looks and femininity without ever allowing us to hear much about what she says or thinks ?
In any case , sexist media coverage has a real impact .
A 2010 US study , commissioned by a non - partisan coalition of womenâ€ ™ s groups , asked 800 likely voters to listen to descriptions of two hypothetical congressional candidates , Dan Jones and Jane Smith .
Half of the voters then heard a sample back - and - forth debate about the candidates , which included sexist descriptions such as â€œmean girlâ€ � and â€œice queenâ€ � and â€œprostituteâ€ � to talk about the female candidate .
The other half heard a similar discussion without the labels .
The findings of the study were stark ; when sexist language was included , Jane Smith lost twice the support compared to the discussion that focused solely on her policies .
Her initial support rating was 43 % , which fell to 33 % after policy based attacks , compared to 21 % after sexist slurs .
The study also found that sexist language undermines the public perception of the female politician , prompting voters to see her as less empathetic , effective and trustworthy .
A follow - up study in 2013 by US organisation
Name
It Change
It presented 1,500 likely voters with the media profiles of two fictional political candidates , one male and one female .
Voters were divided into four groups : one quarter heard no reference to the female candidateâ€ ™ s appearance , while the other three groups were presented with either neutral , positive or negative descriptions of how she looked .
The study itself used real quotes taken from media coverage of female candidates in 2012 elections .
The conclusion ?
â€œWhen media coverage focuses on a womanâ€ ™ s appearance , she pays a price in the horse race , in her favourability , in her likelihood to be seen as possessing positive traits , and in how likely voters are to vote for her.â€
� Importantly , all references to appearance , even apparently positive coverage that seems to praise a female politicianâ€ ™ s looks , still result in a detrimental impact on her candidacy â€ “ a fact especially worth remembering when a journalist comments on the appearance of a woman in power and disguises it as a compliment .
The truth is that sexist media coverage of female politicians really does matter â€ “ it is insidious and demeaning .
It damages votersâ€ ™ perceptions and makes women less likely to be elected ."
2015-07-30,"The facts that the BBC still designates a middle manager to fill the shadowy position of royal liaison officer , while Buckingham Palace controls the broadcasting rights to the 1969 BBC documentary The Royal Family , symbolises the deferential tendencies of the state broadcasterâ€ ™ s relationship with the head of state .
The BBCâ€ ™ s
main terrestrial news rival , ITN , has been luckier .
Its former royal correspondent , Tom Bradby , became a close friend of Prince William and was actually invited to attend his wedding , rather than grudgingly being placed in the press pen .
With Bradby recently appointed as the main anchor of News at Ten , this connection may leave the bulletin well placed for future exclusives , although it makes ITV no less likely than the BBC to examine the royals rigorously .
This may explain the extremely cautious coverage on the UKâ€ ™ s two oldest networks of the recently released film showing the Queen , as a young girl , apparently giving an imitation of the Nazi salute .
With Sky News often compromised in a different direction â€ “ as many of the riskier royal stories , including Princess Elizabethâ€ ™ s seeming heil to Hitler , come from its newspaper stablemate , the Sun â€ “ genuinely independent coverage of the monarchy has generally been left to Channel 4 .
Its programming has ranged from the cheeky â€ “ scheduling against the Queenâ€ ™ s Speech a message from a different political or racial perspective â€ “ to the fearlessly historical : in the past , C4 has screened dramas and documentaries about subjects such as Princess Diana , Princess Margaret and the abdication on which it is hard to imagine BBC or ITV executives gambling their pensions and future knighthoods .
The channel continues this brave tradition with Prince Philip : the Plot to Make a King an insightful and revelatory documentary about the Duke of Edinburghâ€ ™ s transformation from Greek - Germanic sailor of dubious repute into a pillar of the second Elizabethan reign .
Deeply researched and judiciously presented , Richard Sandersâ€ ™ film deserves the bit of luck it has had in appearing just after the fuss about the possible Nazi affiliations of the Queenâ€ ™ s side of the family .
It tells a riveting tale of how the slippery old fixer Lord Mountbatten conspired to marry his nephew , Prince Philip Schleswig - Holstein - Sonderburg - GlÃ¼cksburg , into the British royal family .
The outlines of this story have been told before but the strength of this rendition is the supporting evidence , from both archive and witnesses .
Photos show Philip at the funeral of one of several Nazi relatives , and a veteran survivor of his bloodline , startlingly , reads aloud a privately printed memoir by one of his sisters , describing encounters with Goebbels and Hitler .
In another book written for private circulation â€ “ the documentary benefits greatly from this literary ancestor of blogging â€ “ Philipâ€ ™ s naval captain reveals that , with the encouragement of Mountbatten , he was writing weekly to Princess Elizabeth when she was only 13 .
For many viewers , though , the biggest shock will be the claim that the British royals were initially suspicious of Philip because of his leftwing views .
While it is easy to imagine the present rather ideologically different Duke harrumphing and bloodying during the film â€ “ especially in the sequence about his Nazi sisters
â€ “ the programme is not unsympathetic to him as a man who had to more or less invent the role of royal consort .
Most of Channel 4â€ ™ s previous royal programmes have clearly not been what the palace would have wanted but the status of Prince Philip : the Plot to Make a King is intriguingly ambiguous .
A number of his relatives and friends take part and so there is a feeling that either he or those close to him wanted to tell these stories before they become the province of obituarists and secondhand reporters .

2015-08-12,"Monkey hopes Queen Elizabeth will be as amused as Monkey was by the corrections column in the Sunday Times dealing with its magazineâ€ ™ s â€œThe reign never stopsâ€ � special commemorating her taking the record for Britainâ€ ™ s longest serving monarch .
As the ST conceded , the issue contained â€œa number of inaccuraciesâ€ � â€ “ that number being six .
Highlights included getting the date of the Queenâ€ ™ s accession to the throne wrong , saying Edward VIII was Prince of Wales when he abdicated rather than king , forgetting which was her eldest grandson ( Peter Phillips , not Prince William ) and a picture caption confusing the former with his sister Zara .
Perhaps the STâ€ ™ s subs have discovered a republican streak ?"
2015-08-14,"The running conflict between the young royalsâ€ ™ dual lives as a piece of the constitutional furniture , crown sceptre and first family , and also parents of small children who just want to have fun has hit another of those insoluble dilemmas .
On the one hand , even if you think there should be some quid pro quo for all those houses and flunkies , it seems reasonable that Prince William , the Duchess of Cambridge and their small children should be able to spend time together and with friends confident of their privacy and security .
On the other , small blond toddlers are pretty universally irresistible .
When they are also celebrities , they become big money .
It is a precarious act , maintaining the royal aura without alienating the huge popular enthusiasm which so far they have generally managed so shrewdly , not least in an age when the idea of privacy itself has been Instagrammed almost out of significance .
The letter published on the Prince of Walesâ€ ™ s website this morning , which could be read as a final warning to the paparazzi , is a masterclass in communication strategy .
There is an astonishing and frankly chilling description of the lengths to which some photographers are prepared to go to get informal and unauthorised shots of the family .
This includes hiding out in the woods round the places they visit ( their home in Norfolk , Catherineâ€ ™ s family home in Berkshire ) , or on the dunes above the beach where Prince George and his grandmother ( not the royal one ) are playing .
They use other children to try to lure the princely great - grandson into shot .
The most eyecatching ruse took place only last week , when a particularly determined photographer built himself a kind of hide on wheels and parked up by a play area .
And if the chilling sentence that follows this account
â€ “
â€œThe worry is that it will not always be possible to quickly distinguish between someone taking photos and someone intending to do more immediate harm , â€ � â€ “ sounds hyperbolic , it probably isnâ€ ™ t .
After all , no one could blame Prince William for being paranoid about the paparazzi after their treatment of his mother , Princess Diana .
Thus set up , the letter goes into a warm appeal that suggests no decent human being , once they understood how the pictures had been obtained , would want to buy any magazine that published them .
If such an appeal could ever work , then this should be the one that turns a nation of doting subjects into an army of vigilantes , ready to prick a paparazzo to death with nappy pins .
In the end , since the paparazzi , like drug dealers , will never give up while moneyâ€ ™ s to be made , it may be that the royals themselves have to make a choice .
Are they royal and dignified in the traditional manner , in which case it will be a question of playtime behind high walls ( at least , as the letter acknowledges , they have lovely gardens to play in ) .
Or are they royal and celebrities
â€ “ as the Mario Testino christening images suggest â€ “ in which case they may have to live like all the other celebrities , in that nebulous world between being private , and not being private ."
2015-10-19,"Prince William has told Chinese citizens to stop buying illegally traded wildlife products such as ivory and horn to save Africaâ€ ™ s rhino and elephants , hours before a state visit to the UK by Chinaâ€ ™ s president .
He said : â€œWe have to accept the truth : that consumers are driving the demand for animal body parts , for art , for trinkets , or for medicine .
Only we as consumers can put the wildlife traffickers out of business.â€
�
The Duke of Cambridge made the comment in a speech to a small audience at Kingâ€ ™ s College London that included the broadcasters Sir David Attenborough and Bear Grylls .
It will later be shown to millions on Chinese television station CCTV1 .
â€œIt is time to talk about the growing human demand for illegal wildlife products that drives the trade and makes it profitable , â€ � he continued .
He said the rate of killing â€ “ three rhino and more than 50 elephants a day in South Africa â€
“ meant that children born this year , such as his daughter Charlotte , would see the last elephants and rhino die before their 25th birthday .
â€œThe good news is that we are far from powerless in this struggle .
We can turn the tide of extinction , â€ �
he said , adding that the â€œkilling fieldsâ€ � of poachers and their supply chains were already known .
He praised the Chinese president , Xi Jinping , for saying recently that he would take steps to stop the countryâ€ ™ s domestic ivory trade .
Conservationists say the trade enables the laundering of illegally imported ivory .
The prince visited an elephant sanctuary in Yunnan province during a royal visit to China in March , where he praised the countryâ€ ™ s contribution to protecting wildlife in Africa .
But without singling out China , he said more could done to reduce demand , which comes largely from south - east Asian countries .
â€œDemand provides traffickers with their incentive .
It fuels their greed and generates their vast profits , â€ � he said .
Before the visit , China banned ivory carving imports for a year and Attenborough , along with MPs and conservationists , wrote to Xi to urge him to end the countryâ€ ™ s domestic ivory trade .
William has been campaigning for years against the illegal wildlife trade and in December last year
he used a speech to point out the wholesale price of ivory had jumped from $ 5 to $ 2,100 per kilogram ( about Â£3 to Â£1,350 ) in 25 years , driving poaching .
Along with his father , the Prince of Wales , William was a key figure at a London summit on the wildlife trade in February 2014 .
â€œWe are here with a single shared purpose , to use our collective influence to put a stop to the illegal killing and trafficking of some of our worldâ€ ™ s most iconic and endangered species , â€ �
he told the 46 nations represented at the meeting , where they agreed an accord to tackle the problem ."
2015-11-29,"It was the sight of a beached whale that provided us with a hint that we might soon get up close and personal with one of the planetâ€ ™ s greatest predators .
Our party was drifting â€ “ in Zodiac power boats â€ “ over the icy waters of Coningham Bay , on Prince William Island in Canadaâ€
™ s
high Arctic â€ “ when the beluga was spotted lying on the shore .
A couple of others were seen minutes later .
Stripped of their skin and blubber , the beluga carcasses were the leftovers of an Inuit hunting party and they were providing irresistible enticement for another set of locals : two large male polar bears .
The pair appeared over a sand dune and lumbered down to take a munch or two of whale before wandering off , clearly having already gorged themselves earlier .
One bear â€ “ a huge hill of an animal with white and yellow fur , a battered nose and dainty cottonwool - like ears
â€ “ swam to a nearby ice floe , where he sat staring at us .
For the next quarter of an hour , he contemplated our tourist - filled boats â€ “ a feast in the making from his perspective .
Our pilots kept their engines revved for a quick escape , though the bear was obviously in no mood for action , just a bit of eyeballing .
It was a breathtaking encounter :
the worldâ€ ™ s largest land carnivore posing only a few dozen yards away against a backdrop of misty Arctic wasteland â€ “ though I should stress that polar bears were not the only wonders we witnessed in our trip through the Northwest Passage .
We also saw finback whales , narwhals , musk ox , gyrfalcons , Arctic hare , snowy owls , any amount of gulls and a plethora of other seabirds .
In any case wildlife is not the high Arcticâ€ ™ s only attraction .
The landscape alone is worth the trip â€ “ mysterious , bleak and haunting , with islands stripped of any signs of life save for the thinnest strands of vegetation clinging to the gale - swept ground and crumbling Hudson Bay trading stations abandoned decades ago .
In the 19th century hundreds of men died here trying to find a northwest passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific , the expedition of Sir John Franklin â€ “ which disappeared in 1845 â€ “ being the grimmest , but by no means only , example .
Today global warming is melting the Arcticâ€ ™ s summer ice , and ships with strengthened hulls can sail the passage with ease for several weeks a year .
Hence our decision to abandon Europeâ€ ™ s summer to experience this land of ice and snow as it is transformed by climate change at a speed unmatched in any another other region on Earth .
It was a deeply satisfying but surprisingly busy experience .
There were constant lectures and talks and , with the exception of our two - day voyage across Baffin Bay , we had at least one shore trip a day : to Beechey Island , where three of Franklinâ€ ™ s men are buried below bleached wooden grave markers ; to Prince Leopold Island , whose soaring cliffs provide sanctuary for tens of thousands of kittiwakes , fulmars and guillemots ; and to the Inuit towns of Sisimiut and Pond Inlet .
These journeys involved the donning of thermal underwear , woollen shirts and heavy - duty waterproof gear â€ “ which might seem surprising given that temperatures rarely dropped below zero .
However if you donâ€ ™ t have proper clothing , long journeys in open Zodiacs , in fierce cutting winds , can seriously chill the blood .
It was by no means an arduous holiday .
The food on our ship , the Akademik Sergey Vavilov , was lavish ; there was a cocktail of the day and a happy hour ; a hot tub on deck ; and yes , bars of chocolate were left on our newly made beds every evening .
My wife Sarah
and I did have two main worries before setting off :
rough seas and fellow passengers .
Among the latter , we feared that a few loud - mouthed rednecks in the shipâ€ ™ s confines might wreck our sanity .
Instead we got well - informed , amusing and articulate shipmates .
Some were the best - travelled individuals I have ever encountered .
Others had spent their savings just to make this journey , to see a land in melting transition .
It was a humbling experience .
As to the high seas , they didnâ€ ™ t materialise either .
From our tripâ€ ™ s starting point at Kangerlussuaq in Greenland , across Baffin Bayâ€ ™ s ice floes and icebergs , into Lancaster Sound and south through Victoria Strait before reaching our 2,000 km journeyâ€ ™ s end at Cambridge Bay , on Victoria Island , the seas were calm .
Even our journey through the Bellot Strait â€ “ which separates the most northerly point of mainland America from Canadaâ€ ™ s Arctic islands and is rated one of the worldâ€ ™ s most formidable sea passages
â€ “ was smooth and restful .
Indeed that trip , on a glorious August evening , was especially exhilarating as we cruised through the narrow channel from Atlantic waters to those of the Pacific , towards the setting sun .
At one point we could see a lone wolf on the shore watching us .
Later a polar bear swam across our bows .
And that is not your everyday holiday experience .

2015-12-11,"It began in December 2005 when the Metropolitan police started an investigation into the hacking of Prince Williamâ€ ™ s phone and has ended exactly 10 years later .
In the intervening period , hundreds lost their jobs and many more reputations were both shredded and made , mainly on the legal benches .
More than 200 journalists at the News of the World lost their jobs .
The then commissioner of the Metropolitan police , Paul Stephenson , fell on his sword , while Rebekah Brooks and the former executive chairman of News International , Les Hinton , both resigned in the initial aftermath .
After the experience faced by Murdochâ€ ™ s News UK , some may see some bias in Fridayâ€ ™ s move by prosecutors not to move against Mirror Group Newspapers .
But it was always going to be difficult for the Crown Prosecution Service to bring hacking cases against Mirror Group journalists to court .
The cases against the News of the World executives and journalists drew early guilty pleas because they had documentary evidence of hacking in the form of Glenn Mulcaireâ€ ™ s meticulous notes of commissions .
The original Met inquiry into hacking , Operation Caryatid , was set up in 2005 but was kicked into the long grass until the Guardianâ€ ™ s investigative journalist Nick Davies found evidence of widespread hacking by Mulcaire .
The 2005 inquiry had led to a prosecution of Mulcaire and the paperâ€ ™ s royal editor but , as it later transpired , did not bring the scale of the hacking to light .
While the original Caryatid inquiry named only eight victims of Mulcaireâ€ ™ s phone hacking , the subsequent Operation Weeting inquiry found Mulcaireâ€ ™ s handwritten notes suggested he had targeted 6,349 people either to intercept their voicemail or to â€œblagâ€ � their confidential data .
The original inquiry led to just two arrests .
Weeting and its offshoots have arrested or interviewed under caution some 210 people and led to the marathon hacking trial of 2014 .
The failure of the original Caryatid trial was highlighted during the marathon 2014 hacking trial seven years later when it transpired that Prince William , Prince Harry and Kate Middletonâ€ ™ s phones had been hacked hundreds of times in those early years .
That evidence was not brought to bear in the original Mulcaire trial in 2007 .
But in the end it was the failure not just at the Met , but also the cover - up at News International that prompted the bigger scandal with Murdochâ€ ™ s executive holding the line that hacking was the work of one rogue journalist until 2010 when a celebrity , Sienna Miller , launched a civil case .
In January 2011 , News Corporation decided the rogue line could no longer hold and for the first time fully cooperated with the police , handing over 300 m emails to the Met and prompting a succession of arrests , first of News of the World journalists and later of journalists on the Sun .
While Scotland Yard had to contend with five years of failure to investigate hacking properly , News Corporation found itself plunged into a scandal that threatened ruination , with corporate charges in the US a possibility after it emerged that journalists had paid public officials for stories .
This could have been a crime under the foreign corrupt practices act stateside .
News Corporation learned in February it would not be prosecuted in the US , but there was still a chance corporate charges would follow in the UK .
Fridayâ€ ™
s announcement that this would not happen was expected since October when the final two Sun journalists tried for alleged corrupt payments were cleared .
Murdoch was so confident he reinstated Brooks , who had been cleared of all charges in the hacking trial , as chief executive of News UK .
While the Met got nine convictions out of 12 prosecutions for hacking , the outcome for Elveden was not good , with just two convictions out of the 34 people interviewed and/or charged .
For the Mirror , however , the story is not over .
Its journalists will be relieved that the torturous wait for a charging decision is over â€ “ the former Mirror editor Piers Morgan says he never wants to talk about hacking again â€
“ but the company still faces more than 100 civil compensation claims and as of May it had set aside Â£28 m for damages ."
2015-12-16,"Prince William receives highly sensitive cabinet papers as well as his father , Prince Charles , it has emerged .
The second in line to the throne is sent confidential papers from the very top of government â€œoccasionallyâ€ � and â€œwhen relevantâ€ � , a royal source confirmed .
This follows news of the little - known access granted to Charles to the highest - level government dossiers , which was exposed in the Guardian on Tuesday after a three - year freedom of information battle by Republic , the campaign for an elected head of state .
The government justified Charlesâ€ ™ s access to the high level cabinet memorandums , which even ministers of state do not see , because he was heir to the throne .
On Wednesday night it said Williamâ€ ™ s access was because he was â€œfuture heir to the throneâ€ � .
The Guardian understands the amount of material William receives is more modest than that given to Charles or the Queen and includes material relating to countries where he is engaged in official overseas visits .
â€œThe Duke of Cambridge is a senior member of the royal family and future heir to the throne and therefore of course it is appropriate that he is regularly briefed on government business , â€ � a Cabinet Office spokesman said .
But Republicâ€ ™ s chief executive , Graham Smith , said : â€œThere appears to be no good reason why William is getting this information .
There is no mention of this access in the documents released this week .
It appears to be a free - for - all.â€ � Labour has called for an inquiry , which Smith supports â€œso we can know how much information is being handed to which royalsâ€ � .
Charles â€œis one of the most powerful lobbyists in the country and he has more information than some of the ministers he is
lobbyingâ€ � , said Clive Lewis MP , a shadow minister .
â€œThat is not right or proper .
There needs to be more transparency about his powers and his access to confidential briefings .
Who authorises them and why has it been kept secret ?
It undermines public confidence in our democratic processes if you have to drag this information kicking and screaming into the daylight.â€
�
On Wednesdsay night the Cabinet Office declined to confirm or deny whether William was receiving cabinet files or comment on whether any other royals were .
Prof Adam Tomkins , a constitutional lawyer , said Charles risked damaging the monarchy if he used the highly confidential cabinet papers to assist his lobbying .
Tomkins , a professor of public law at Glasgow University , said : â€œThe heir to the throne has unique access , with the Queen , both to government papers and to ministers .
Were they minded to do so , they would be able to use that access to lobby .
â€œThe Queen has acted in an exemplary manner by not doing that and Charles should behave like she does .
To the extent that he doesnâ€ ™ t , he risks damaging the institution of the monarchy.â€ �
Bernard Jenkin , the Conservative chairman of the House of Commons constitutional affairs committee , said ministers should have been more open about Charlesâ€ ™ s access , but added that it was outrageous to describe him as a lobbyist .
Jenkin said : â€œHe only acts in the public interest .
It is his view of the public interest
but I expect the vast majority of this country support that.â€
�
Jenkin is facing calls from a Labour member of his committee , Paul Flynn , to investigate Charlesâ€ ™ s access to cabinet papers .
Flynn warned that there was â€œa great nervousnessâ€ � among parliamentarians about raising the issue of Charlesâ€ ™ s interaction with government â€œbecause it is so full of matters that are illogical and indefensible and people donâ€ ™ t want to disturb itâ€ � .
Ed Davey , the former Liberal Democrat MP , who had two private meetings with Charles while he was secretary of state for energy and climate change , said he was â€œvery relaxedâ€
� about Charles receiving the papers .
He said Charles was â€œvery well informed and not just from the cabinet papersâ€ � .
â€œWe were in total agreement on our views and I didnâ€ ™ t feel lobbied , â€ � he said .
â€œIf I was against taking action on climate change the meetings might have been more frustrating.â€ �"
2016-02-16,"The Duke of Cambridge has said Britainâ€ ™ s ability to work with other nations is the â€œbedrock of our security and prosperityâ€ � , in remarks that will prompt speculation that he is endorsing the UKâ€ ™ s continued membership of the European Union .
In a speech to British diplomats at the Foreign Office in London , the second in line to the throne said common action was essential in a troubled world .
Prince William told recipients of the inaugural Diplomatic Academy awards : â€œIn an increasingly turbulent world , our ability to unite in common action with other nations is essential .
It is the bedrock of our security and prosperity and is central to your work .
â€œRight now , the big questions with which you wrestle â€ “ in the UN , Nato , the Middle East and elsewhere â€ “ are predicated on your commitment to working in partnership with others.â€ �
Kensington Palace said the duke was not talking about the EU .
â€œThis speech was not about Europe , â€ � a palace spokesman said .
â€œHe does not mention the word Europe once.â€
�
A royal source added : â€œTalking about â€˜working in partnershipâ€ ™ and â€˜our ability to unite in common actionâ€ ™ is not expressing a political view .
â€œThe only specific examples he spoke about were the Commonwealth and the illegal wildlife trade .
The speech was praising the work of young diplomats.â€ �
The speech will draw comparisons with remarks made by the Queen on the eve of the Scottish independence referendum in 2014 in which she asked voters to â€œthink very carefully about the futureâ€ � .
The Queen spoke after an appeal from Downing Street amid fears that the yes campaign could win the referendum .
The foreign secretary , Philip Hammond , who welcomed William to the awards , will know that an intervention on the eve of the EU summit to discuss the proposed UK deal will be seen at the very least as an endorsement of full UK participation in multilateral organisations .
But Downing Street had no knowledge of the contents of the speech , suggesting that the government was not involved in any attempt to sign up William to the pro - EU side .
The prince used the words partner or partnership six times in the speech , showing his support for the defining feature of the UKâ€ ™ s post - second world war foreign policy : direct involvement in four multilateral organisations .
He mentioned three of those â€ “ Nato , the UN and the Commonwealth â€ “ but diplomatically glossed over the EU .
He was careful , as the Queen was in 2014 , not to explicitly endorse one side in the referendum .
But he made clear that Britain had always been â€œoutward
lookingâ€ � and had never retreated .
â€œI thought I might â€ ¦ take a moment to say something about what I interpret to be our shared values : internationalism , tolerance and service ,
â€ � he said .
â€œFor centuries , Britain has been an outward - looking nation .
Hemmed in by sea , we have always sought to explore what is beyond the horizon .
â€œThat sense of mission and curiosity is something that I know continues to drive our economy , our cultural and educational exports , and our armed forces and diplomatic service .
And wherever we go , we have a long and proud tradition of seeking out allies and partners.â€ �
William said his campaign to crack down on the illegal trade in ivory and rhino horn â€œcannot be solved without nations working together in new waysâ€ � .
A Ukip source said it would be wrong to suggest that William had been endorsing a particular side in the referendum campaign .
But the source said the party would be concerned if ministers had played any role in drafting the speech .
â€œIf the governmentâ€ ™ s fingerprints are on any spin saying Prince William supports the EU after a very bland statement about international organisations such as the UN , Nato and the Commonwealth , then that is extremely poor form on the part of the FCO [ Foreign and Commonwealth Office ] and they should know better ,
â€ � the source said .
Liz Bilney , chief executive of the Leave .
EU group , said : â€œHis royal highnessâ€ ™ s talk to diplomats about maintaining partnerships as crucial to our countryâ€ ™ s interests is of course right , but it is taking a leap to suggest that this means we have to stay inside a failing institution like the European Union that does not always represent our interests or our views .
â€œCommentators with a keen eye might have noticed that he listed organisations he presumably felt valuable , such as Nato and the United Nations , but did not explicitly state the European Union .
â€œI could just as easily claim that this commission signalled Prince William believes we should not give any importance to the EU , but I would not wish to be so presumptuous.â€ �
William also paid tribute to his grandmother in his speech .
â€œAs the Queen approaches her 90th birthday , it is worth reflecting on the unparalleled role that the Queen has played in foreign relations and with world leaders during 63 years of unbroken service to the nation and Commonwealth , â€ �
he said .
â€œThis is the same duty to nation and commitment to the wider common good that I see in Her Majestyâ€ ™ s diplomats as I travel around the world .
â€œThat association between the diplomatic service and the Queen holds true for me , too .
In many ways , your mission is also mine.â€ � Royal â€˜interventionsâ€ ™ Apart from the comparison with the Queenâ€ ™ s Scottish independence remarks , Williamâ€ ™ s comments echo an arguably more explicit plea from his grandmother during her state visit to Germany last year , praising Britainâ€ ™ s â€œirreversibleâ€ � friendship with Germany .
They also show that , like his father , William is not afraid to cross diplomatic borders .
In October , just hours before a state visit to the UK by Chinaâ€ ™ s president , he told Chinese people to stop buying illegally traded wildlife products .
The acorn doesnâ€ ™ t fall far from the tree : a cache of secret memos between Prince Charles and senior government ministers released last year showed that conservational interests , ranging from the Patagonian toothfish to badgers , were close to Williamâ€ ™ s fatherâ€ ™ s heart too .
Last year , Charles also claimed that French artisanal cheese could disappear because of the â€œbacteriological correctnessâ€ � of European regulators .
But William has some way to go before he can match his fatherâ€ ™ s observations on war .
In November , Charles said climate change might have contributed to the civil war in Syria ."
2016-02-17,"Iâ€ ™ ve read Prince Williamâ€ ™ s speech in which he supposedly endorsed Britainâ€ ™ s continued membership of the EU .
Iâ€ ™ ve read it sideways and upside down .
Only a fool or a rogue could place on the ladâ€ ™ s remarks the construction placed on it overnight by assorted Eurosceptic hooligans and large swaths of Fleet Streetâ€ ™ s finest .
Even the FT put this phoney controversy on page one .
Shame on you , Mr Editor !
The controversial sentence , the one which pushed up blood pressures which are already dangerously high , runs as follows : â€œIn an increasingly turbulent world , our ability to unite in common action with other nations
is essential.â€
�
There was a passage about â€œworking in partnership with othersâ€ � , which invoked â€œthe UN , Nato , the Middle Eastâ€ � .
There was also a reference to the Commonwealth , of which granny is the head .
But the word â€œEuropeâ€ � never crossed the royal lips .
No , not Europe , EU or even : â€œIsnâ€ ™ t Jean - Claude Juncker a terrific bloke
, canâ€ ™ t get enough of him.â€ � Heâ€ ™ s not daft , heâ€
™ s got a fine art degree , and the people who tell him how to keep out of trouble arenâ€ ™ t daft either , short of a few chins though many of them are .
Prince Billyâ€ ™ s discretion is in marked contrast to this weekâ€ ™ s contribution to the EU debate from theatrical royalty .
Itâ€ ™ s a real Idiotâ€ ™ s Guide on how not to win friends and influence people .
Yes , Emma Thompson ( â€œthe outspoken darling of the leftâ€ � - Daily Mail ) shared her Brexit thoughts while in Berlin to promote her latest film , Alone in Berlin .
â€œOf
course
Iâ€ ™ m going to vote to stay in Europe
, are you kidding?â€ �
she told reporters .
â€œMy God , of course , it would be madness not to .
Itâ€ ™ s a crazy idea not to .
We should be taking down borders , not putting them up.â€
�
Fair enough .
Apart from the daffy bit about borders , I could go along with that conclusion .
But in her bid to woo swing voters Thompson stepped over one of the Mailâ€ ™ s misty red lines by describing her native land as , â€œa tiny little , cloud - bolted , rainy corner of sort - of - Europe ,
I mean really a cake - filled , misery - laden grey old islandâ€ � .
Was it a joke ?
It isnâ€ ™ t clear from the video .
Either way , I suspect most Germans , who retain some respect , even affection for these islands will disapprove of that sort of snobbery .
I certainly do .
Shakespeare , who helps keep Emma in gainful employment , certainly would .
He liked the septreâ€ ™
d isle , cake and all .
The outburst earned her a double page spread ( â€œLuvvie Emma Sneers at Britainâ€ � ) in the Mail , a fate I rarely wish on anyone .
When the Mail does a job on someone it does it properly .
I thoroughly enjoyed the piece , not least because Emma has form , all duly noted by the thorough Mail .
It matters because arrogant , disrespectful attitudes like this may cost the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign the win it thinks itâ€ ™ s heading towards if the referendum is staged on 23 June .
Brexit voters feel neglected , they fear for their childrenâ€ ™ s future in a scary world .
The remedies they are being offered by charlatans of right and left may make things worse , but the fears deserve respect .
The emerging facts are bad enough .
It now transpires that the European parliament will be asked to legislate on David Cameronâ€ ™ s â€œemergency brakeâ€ � on welfare payments to EU migrants after the UK votes yes to continued membership ( if it does ) .
That assumes that Cameron gets his modest renegotiation deal this weekend , of course .
Some smaller countries , even more insular than us in the deepening global crisis , are getting in a strop .
Super - cool Dave is said to be â€œunder great pressureâ€ � .
So he should be .
All this was his idea .
â€œThe parliament can be unpredictable , it can be monkeys with guns , â€ � one â€˜senior officialâ€ ™
( anonymous sources are always â€œseniorâ€ � , arenâ€ ™ t they ? ) told the BBC .
I bet he / she is a Brit .
Thatâ€ ™ s not a very French joke .
I havenâ€
™ t been to the European parliament for years .
Theyâ€ ™ re mostly decent people , trying to do their best , a bit like Emma Thompson .
Like her , they enjoy periods of idleness between bouts of intense activity .
Unlike her they are paid to think quite hard about the issues , even when they sometimes reach the wrong conclusion .
But Thompson is an actor , sheâ€ ™ s paid to speak other peopleâ€ ™ s lines , just like Michael Caine whose muddled Brexit comments I mocked a while back .
I know
sheâ€ ™ s much more than that , a good person too .
But sensible people should take no more notice of actorsâ€ ™ opinions than they do of the greengrocer or the vicar .
We all have one vote .
That all puts Prince Williamâ€ ™ s anodyne remarks in a calmer context , doesnâ€ ™ t it ?
Idiots on both sides of the Brexit debate profess themselves quietly pleased or outraged by what he said , though in fairness to the Mail it ran a sidebar ( see here below main article ) asking :
â€œBut did he really mean the opposite?â€
�
Yes , the Mail spotted that Billyâ€ ™ s words about cooperation with other members of â€œthe community of nationsâ€ � ( whatever next ! )
could be interpreted in the chanceries and pubs of Europe as referring to those other interlocking circles extolled by Churchill , the UN , Commonwealth , Nato and the special relationship with Washington .
Stuff Europe , eh ! â€œWe have always sought to explore beyond the horizon , â€ �
he said in what must surely have been a swipe at 500 million cheese - eating surrender monkeys clearly in sight from the cliffs of Kent on a good day .
Itâ€ ™ s all rubbish , of course , just as the Queenâ€ ™ s advice to Scots to â€œthink very carefullyâ€ � before voting in the referendum
was a statement of the bland and blindingly obvious .
But condescending attitudes in the Yes to Europe camp are as irresponsibly dangerous as the vague fantasies , upbeat or menacing , offered by the other side .
In or out weâ€ ™ ll need to cooperate with foreigners , wonâ€ ™ t
we ?
So good of you to be boring , Your Highness .
Sorry about the spin ."
2016-02-18,"It has been coming for a while .
The Sun , despite its support for the monarchy , has given both barrels to Prince William .
In a spread headlined â€œMeddling Wills is throne idleâ€
�
, the paper accused him of a reluctance to carry out public engagements while enjoying the life of a huntinâ€ ™ , shootinâ€ ™ and fishinâ€ ™ â€œgentleman country
farmerâ€ � .
There is , said the article , â€œlittle doubt about Williamâ€ ™ s desperation to shun the role he was born to doâ€ � .
He is â€œthe very essence of a reluctant royal.â€ �
The piece was prompted by one of the princeâ€ ™ s rare public appearances - his first in 2016 - in which he addressed foreign office staff and , in so doing , provoked something of a row .
His remarks prompted speculation that he was endorsing the UKâ€ ™ s continued membership of the European Union ( a view comprehensively rubbished by the Guardianâ€ ™ s Michael White ) .
But the Sun saw it as a breach of royal protocol , implying that it was an anti - Brexit speech .
Whether it was or wasnâ€ ™ t , the paperâ€ ™ s senior executives believed the prince should have been more careful in what he said .
More than that , the Sun used the opportunity to air other grievances about the prince .
It reported : â€œMany people , including his own friends , are starting to question whether William really wants to be royal at all.â€ �
It contrasted the number of public engagements he carried out in 2015 with other members of the royal family .
With a total of 122 , William did fewer than 11 other royals , including his 94-year - old grandfather .
The Sunâ€ ™ s story stated : â€œHe deliberately based himself , wife Kate and their children â€ ”
George , two , and nine - month - old Charlotte â€ ” out of the public eye at the ten - bedroom Anmer Hall in deepest Norfolk .
And he shows little interest in taking on more royal patronages , preferring instead to work as a pilot for the local air ambulance.â€ �
It criticised his failure , as Bafta president , to turn up the awards ceremony â€œfor the second successive yearâ€ � .
And it also pointed out that he rarely spends any time in London â€œdespite YOU having to fork out Â£4 m for the refurbishment of the familyâ€ ™ s 22-room apartment at Kensington Palace.â€
�
The Sunâ€ ™ s real message , about the princeâ€ ™ s dislike for the media , is also revealed mid - way through the article : â€œHis disdain for the media is well known and the only images of his two children â€ ” and increasingly his wife â€ ” are carefully controlled by the Palace spin machine.â€ �
This view , that Prince William is seeking to exercise control over journalists , particularly photographers , is not confined to the Sun .
Several editors have remarked on the way in which his staff unleash a barrage of complaints whenever pictures are taken of the princeâ€ ™ s wife , the Duchess of Cambridge .
It is conceded that his children should be protected , but palace claims that they are being stalked by photographers have yet to be proved .
No legal action has been taken against the alleged stalkers , a fact which convinces some editors that the complaints have more to do with sealing off the couple from any scrutiny whatsoever .
Tabloid editors are not the only ones to question the princeâ€ ™ s reluctance to appear in public .
Joan Smith , writing in the Independent in 2013 , noted how few engagements he carried out .
More recently , in August last year , she picked up on the implications of an open letter to the media written by the princeâ€ ™ s communications secretary , Jason Knauf , in which he complained about paparazzi hiding in car boots and using children as â€œbaitâ€ � in order to take pictures of Prince George .
â€œPeople are allowed to take pictures in a public place as long as their behaviour doesnâ€ ™ t amount to stalking , â€ � she wrote .
And if it did amount to stalking then a prosecution was possible under the Protection from Harassment Act .
Although the editors of the Sun and Daily Mail , Tony Gallagher and Paul Dacre respectively , would normally have little truck with Smith , a former executive editor of Hacked Off , I imagine them agreeing with her further point .
Whatâ€ ™ s so wrong about â€œunauthorisedâ€ � pictures of the royal children ?
Smith wrote : â€œWhat no one bothered to ask after the publication of Knaufâ€ ™ s letter is what harm the Duke and Duchess have actually suffered .
They are annoyed , but thatâ€ ™ s different from being frightened , alarmed or distressed.â€ �
I may be reading too much into the Sunâ€ ™ s broadside against Prince William , but I detect a change of heart that could turn into a change of strategy .
Is it to be open season on the huntinâ€ ™ , shootin and fishinâ€ ™ prince and his family from now on ?"
2016-02-21,"Prince William is a very successful royal .
Like Elton John as a songwriter or Gyles Brandreth in Dictionary Corner ,
heâ€ ™ s just good at it .
He has a knack .
He is not â€œgood at itâ€ � in the old - fashioned way .
An old - school successful royal exudes strangeness and decadence , entitlement and pomp .
For this , you must look no further than Prince Andrew .
( I donâ€
™ t know where he currently is , but we can only assume heâ€ ™ s in a hot tub in the Middle East , unwinding after a strenuous dayâ€ ™ s work at a topless golf tournament to boost UK trade , angrily reflecting on how little we appreciate him .
If you can hear me , Andrew : I appreciate you . )
Prince Andrewâ€ ™ s personality is so enormous that we can , like Armando Iannucci and Steve Coogan could while writing Alan Partridge , imagine what he would do and say in pretty much any situation at all .
Prince William is the opposite .
We simply donâ€
™ t know him , not even in the one - dimensional way that so adds to the gaiety of nations .
We canâ€ ™ t caricature him .
We wouldnâ€ ™ t know what to exaggerate .
If we try to imagine what Prince William thinks about things , we never get beyond what we think about things .
He wants a job but enjoys his time off .
Heâ€ ™ s fond of his children .
He likes a laugh .
The way in which we meaninglessly project our own opinions on to this uncontroversial , undislikable prince was perfectly illustrated by his speech last week to Foreign Office diplomats .
A few bland remarks about â€œour ability to unite in common action with other nationsâ€ � were hailed by the pro - EU lobby as a sign of his royal highnessâ€ ™ s support for a federal Europe .
But Eurosceptic MP Peter Bone said : â€œIt sounds to me much more like a pro - Nato speechâ€ ¦ more global in nature than pro - European.â€ �
The Britain Stronger in Europe group said the prince was clearly â€œgetting behind the campaign for Britain to stay in the EUâ€ � .
But the anti - EU Daily Mail said â€œthe speech could easily be interpreted as being sympathetic to the case for Brexitâ€ � .
Well done that prince !
It is absolutely to his credit that onlookers project their opinions on to him as though they were renting banner space on his newly gleaming head .
His remarks are as featureless as a top - quality Imax screen â€ “ they allow our own views to be presented in razor - sharp HD .
So , after searching around in my own brain , here are a few things that it is very clear that the prince has been thinking .
â€¢ Prince William finds it very annoying when the people on the cash register at Tesco put a receipt into his hand with change on top of it .
Prince William is already juggling the shopping , his purse and his handbag .
He can do without extra bits of crap .
â€¢ Prince William was horrified by that story about an airline pilot being dazzled by a shop - bought laser pointer .
Bloody hell , Prince William thought .
Planes are terrifying enough already , what with mechanical failure and terrorist bombs and anti - aircraft guns and suicidal alpine copilots and geese flying into engines .
Now they can be brought down with something you buy in a toyshop ?
Thatâ€ ™ s it
, Prince William has resolved : from now on , heâ€ ™ s having all his holidays in Dorset .
â€¢ Prince William is amused to read that Marmite has become popular in Spain , the land of tapas .
Prince William thinks this neatly disproves the stupid cliche that Marmite is something you love or hate , when in fact everyone is happy to have a small amount of it but nobody wants much .
â€¢ Prince William wishes that shorts
didnâ€ ™ t exist .
He can see them trickling into the shops again .
They are so unflattering and yet , on a hot day , so comfy and convenient .
If they didnâ€ ™ t exist , Prince William reflects gloomily every summer , then he wouldnâ€ ™ t have to face that quandary .
â€¢ Prince William is happy for Roman Abramovich that plans have been approved for a Â£28 m subterranean leisure complex beneath the oligarchâ€ ™ s London home .
The sinister football magnate wants to update what he describes as his current â€œmiserableâ€ � swimming pool .
But Prince William canâ€ ™ t help asking himself whether a swimming pool jemmied into a London basement will ever be anything else .
He wonders if the plutocrat might not consider building it in , for example , Corfu .
â€¢ Prince William is struggling with the idea that Stephen Fry was called sexist for joking at an awards ceremony that a costume designer was dressed like a bag lady .
The Duke of Cambridge agrees with the legendary QI funnyman that â€œjoshing is legitimateâ€ � .
If one only joshes men about their appearance , and never women , surely that would be sexist ?
Sexist means discriminatory , no ?
It might have been an ungallant remark , and Prince William has always thought that gallantry is rather lovely , but only in a sexist sort of way .
Prince William secretly feels quite warm and charmed when he locks eyes with a twinkly old duffer
whoâ€ ™ s held open a door .
Can one be gallant without being sexist ?
The prince isnâ€ ™ t sure where he stands on this , despite having been a woman for 40-odd years .
â€¢ Prince William doesnâ€ ™ t like it when film trailers include too many jokes and plot points .
It makes Prince William suspect that theyâ€ ™ ve put every good thing about the film into the trailer and the rest is just waffle .
Prince William thinks that film trailers should be teasers , not digests .
Now he comes to think of it
, Prince William wonders whether there might actually be something he can do about this , in his role as the honorary president of Bafta .
Prince William is now a bit confused about the format of this column ."
2016-03-01,"Sir Jeremy Heywood , the cabinet secretary , has denied â€œpoliticisingâ€ � the Queen - despite refusing to deny that he was involved in getting her to speak out against Scottish independence ahead of the referendum in 2014 .
The Labour MP Paul Flynn accused Heywood of politicising her , and said that a recent speech by Prince William suggested ministers and civil servants were again trying involve the royals in a referendum .
( See 6.05pm . )
The exchange came during a hearing on Heywoodâ€ ™ s guidance as to what government information ministers can see if they are campaigning for Britain to leave the EU .
Heywood said that ministers would get all the information they needed , apart from â€œbriefing material or speech materialâ€ � which they could use to attack the governmentâ€ ™ s position on the EU .
Bernard Jenkin , the Eurosceptic Conservative who chairs the public administration and constitutional affairs committee , suggested that this was reasonable and said that he was glad Heywood had cleared up the matter .
Heywoodâ€ ™ s letter to civil servants explaining his rules suggested that the restrictions for Brexit ministers would be more wide - ranging , Jenkin said .
Heywood said that ministers could also see any facts they wanted , but that they could not commission â€œfactsâ€ � to be used to attack the governmentâ€ ™ s position .
This , from Skyâ€ ™ s Faisal Islam , sums this up nicely .
The Sun editor , Tony Gallagher , has said he hasnâ€ ™ t decided which side the newspaper will back at Juneâ€ ™ s referendum on EU membership , despite the â€œextremely scepticalâ€ � tone of its EU coverage .
The state pension age could rise quicker than expected after the government announced an inquiry into whether it should still be linked to life expectancy , Labour and financial experts have said .
New controls on trade unions that could cut Labourâ€
™ s
funding by Â£8 m a year may be delayed , as peers are expected to recommend more progress on changes to party funding before some changes go ahead .
Nicola Sturgeonâ€ ™ s government is to set up a new Scottish benefits agency to oversee and simplify more than Â£2.7bn of welfare spending .
Thatâ€ ™ s all from me for today .
Thanks for the comments .
Here are the key quotes from the exchange between Paul Flynn , the Labour MP , and Sir Jeremy Heywood , the cabinet secretary .
Heywood refused to deny being involved in getting the Queen to speak out against Scottish independence .
Flynn put this allegation to him , quoting from Cameron at 10 by Anthony Seldon and Peter Snowdon .
Heywood replied : I never comment on royal matters .
Flynn accused Heywood of â€œpoliticisingâ€ � the royal family .
After making the point about the Queen and the Scottish independence referendum , Flynn told Heywood : Iâ€ ™ m accusing you of collaborating and politicising the royal family .
These matters were regarded as being so important , the break - up of the United Kingdom , that something had to be done about it .
Flynn also quoted what happened when Prince William recently appeared to use a speech at the Foreign Office to make the case for Britain staying in the EU .
( There is no doubt that Number 10 was involved in getting the Queen to speak out , in coded terms , against Scottish independence , but Number 10 says it did not know about Prince Williamâ€ ™ s speech in advance and it has not been proved this was a politically - motivated intervention . )
Heywood denied â€œpoliticisingâ€ � the royals .
Although he would not comment on the claim that he was involved in getting her to speak out against Scottish independence , he objected to the suggestion that he had ever â€œpoliticisedâ€ � her .
I would never dream of trying to politicise Her Majesty the Queen .
( There may be a civil service view that getting the Queen of the United Kingdom to speak out in favour of the United Kingdom does not amount to politicisation .
Flynn quoted from the Seldon / Snowdon book , but he would have had better material if he had quoted from the Guardianâ€ ™ s long read on this , by Severin Carrell , Nicholas Watt and Patrick Wintour , which covered it in more detail .
Hereâ€ ™ s an excerpt .
Sir Jeremy Heywood , the cabinet secretary , and Sir Christopher Geidt , the Queenâ€ ™ s private secretary , embarked on discussions to work out how the Queen might register her concerns at the prospect of a yes vote while upholding her constitutional duty to remain wholly impartial .
The Whitehall machinery was fully apprised of the prime ministerâ€ ™ s concerns that the yes side was developing an ominous momentum .
The talks between the most senior civil servant in the land and the palaceâ€ ™ s most senior official , the two key figures at the heart of what the Whitehall source described as the â€œdeep stateâ€ � , focused in the first place on the wisdom of a public intervention by the monarch , who has been scrupulously impartial during her 62 years on the throne .
Once it became clear that the Queen was minded to speak out , Geidt and Heywood then needed to fashion some words that would ensure that the she remained within the bounds expected of a constitutional monarch .
Jim Lawson , a veteran freelance reporter who has dutifully covered royal visits to the Scottish Highlands for decades
â€
“ he remembers covering Prince Charles at Gordonstoun boarding school in the 1960s
â€ “ got the answer a week later on Sunday 14 September , outside Crathie Kirk , the small church where the Queen attends Sunday services while at Balmoral .
As he has done at these events for years , Lawson wandered over to the crowd behind the barriers after the Queen had departed , to harvest quotes from her greetings to wellwishers .
To his surprise , one woman disclosed that the monarch had offered a coded warning about the impending referendum , telling her : â€œWell , I hope people will think very carefully about the future.â€
�
â€œThe Queen looked almost uneasy , â€ � Lawson recalled .
â€œIt was strange .
[ She ] didnâ€ ™ t look supremely confident.â€ �
When he asked the woman who had spoken to the Queen for her name , a friend standing with her urged her not to reveal it .
When Lawson asked her why not , she replied â€œItâ€ ™ s my job.â€ �
For Lawson , this was a first .
â€œIt has never happened in my life before , â€ � he recalled .
â€œNormally if the Queen has talked to someone , theyâ€ ™ re delighted to give you everything .
I was baffled , to be honest.â€ �
Bernard Jenkin is now summing up .
He says Heywood has been very helpful .
He has clarified that Brexit ministers can get access to facts .
Heywood says that is correct .
But he says the civil service will not be pro - actively producing facts that can be used to attack the government .
Jenkin quotes from the Heywoodâ€ ™ s letter .
He says that letter suggests Brexit ministers could be denied access to a wider range of material .
But Heywood says he has clarified that ministers will only be denied access to speech and briefing material .
He says that it would have been better if Heywoodâ€ ™ s letter , and the Q&amp;A that went with it , had made it clear .
But he indicates that he is happy with the situation now .
And thatâ€ ™ s it .
I will post a summary now .
Heywood says Iain Duncan Smith , the work and pensions secretary , has not commissioned work from his department to attack government policy , and he would not expect him to do so .
David Jones , the Conservative MP and former Welsh secretary , goes next .
Q :
Where you surprised by how much anger there was about this in the Commons yesterday ( when Matthew Hancock answered an urgent question on it ) ?
Yes , says Heywood .
Q :
So will you rewrite the guidance ?
Heywood says it is clear .
Q :
Have any secretaries of state raised concerns with you about these guidelines ?
Heywood says one secretary of state raised a point about facts .
He says he thinks the matter was resolved .
Q :
How many council of ministers meetings will pro - Brexit ministers attend between now and the referendum ?
Heywood says he is not sure .
But there is nothing to stop pro - Brexit ministers attending a council of ministers meeting in Brussels .
The Labour MP Paul Flynn says Sir Jeremy Heywoodâ€ ™ s answer to his questions on the royals ( see 4.41pm ) was â€œludicrousâ€ � .
At least someone is finding this interesting - Sir Jeremy Heywood is now trending on Twitter .
Kate Hoey goes next .
Q :
What will you do if a minister or civil servant breaks this guidance ?
Heywood says he does not like speculating on hypotheticals .
It would be up to the prime minister to decide what happened to a minister .
If a civil servant broke the rules , Heywood would regard that as a serious issue .
He would look at this â€œin the roundâ€ � , using a common sense approach , he says .
Heywood says his guidance applies to some public servants outside the civil service .
But he would have to get back to the committee to explain exactly who might be covered .
Q : Wonâ€ ™ t
the public think the prime minister is hiding something ?
Heywood says he thinks people will be more interested in the substantive issues .
He says the civil service works to support the governmentâ€ ™ s position .
But in all other respects things will carry on as normal for ministers .
Labourâ€ ™ s Kate Hoey goes next .
Q : Wouldnâ€ ™ t
it have been better to produce common sense guidance ?
Heywood say his guidance is common sense .
In his experience , he says , there is always some confusion in the first few weeks of a campaign like his .
Heywood says he is happy for Iain Duncan Smith , the work and pensions secretary , to see the statistics his department is preparing for Number 10 .
He also says officials often produce statistics that do not get shared with the secretary of state .
He says it would be â€œliterally impossibleâ€ � for ministers to see all the statistics produced by their departments .
Talk of conspiracy is well â€œwide of the markâ€
� , he says .
He is â€œvery comfortableâ€
� with ministers seeing facts produced by their departments .
The Labour MP Paul Flynn says in Anthony Seldon and Peter Snowdonâ€ ™ s book Cameron at 10 it is said that Downing Street got Buckingham Palace involved in the Scottish independence campaign .
Heywood says he never comments on royal matters .
Q :
But Number 10 was involved in making sure the Queenâ€ ™ s view were made public .
You politicised the royal family .
Heywood says he will not comment on royal matters .
Then he says he would never politicise the Queen .
Heywood says he would never â€œpoliticiseâ€ � the Queen - but refuses to comment on reports Number 10 was involved in getting her to intervene in the Scottish independence referendum .
Flynn quotes what Prince William said recently about the importance of uniting with other nations .
Heywood says he would not presume to tell the In campaign what to do .
Bernard Jenkin goes next .
Q :
Would it be normal for the heir to the throne to give a speech in the Foreign Office without it being seen by Number 10 ?
Heywood says Prince William is not heir to the throne .
He does not know what the scrutiny arrangements are for Prince Williamâ€ ™ s speeches .
Cheryl Gillan , the Conservative MP , goes next .
Q :
You issued a Q&amp;A alongside the guidance .
But that was not meant to be published .
Why not ?
Heywood says the Q&amp;A is there to help civil servants interpret the guidance .
It is a living document .
It will get updated .
He says the prime ministerâ€ ™ s letter to ministers , and his guidance , are the key documents .
Bernard Jenkin , the committee chairman , starts the questioning .
Q :
How did you produce this guidance ?
Sir Jeremy Heywood says he looked at what happened in the 1975 referendum ( when cabinet ministers were allowed to campaign on either side ) and at what happened in the Scottish independence referendum .
He also consulted the prime minister .
He says he did not view the rules as particularly controversial .
Q :
Where is the precedent for denying ministers access to information ?
Heywood says he thinks there has been a misunderstanding .
Brexit ministers will not get access to information relating to the EU referendum .
But they will get all other information .
The civil service will continue to provide a â€œlimousineâ€ � service , he says .
Q :
In what respect does your guidance differ from 1975 ?
Heywood says it does not differ in relation to civil servants .
But he says there are minor differences affecting special advisers .
In 1975 there was no code for special advisers .
Here is the letter Sir Jeremy Heywood wrote to civil servants recently setting out the rules that would apply to Brexit ministers during the EU referendum period ( pdf ) .
Sir Jeremy Heywood , the cabinet secretary , is about to give evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee about the EU referendum .
The hearing is expected to focus largely on the row about pro - Brexit ministers being denied access to government papers relating to the EU referendum .
Jolyon Maugham , a tax barrister and Labour supporter , has written about George Osborneâ€ ™ s claim that cutting the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p raised Â£8bn on his waitingfortax blog .
He is not impressed by the announcement , and he says that Osborneâ€ ™ s handling of this cost the taxpayer more than Â£2bn .
Hereâ€ ™ s an excerpt .
As Osborne well knows , if you tell people in March 2012 that youâ€ ™ re going to cut their tax bill by a tenth ( from 50 % to 45 % ) in a yearâ€ ™ s time , people will choose to delay payment until April 2013 when their bills will be lower .
And they did ...
In other words , tax receipts were artificially low in 2012 - 13 ( because people delayed receiving income until rates fell ) and were artificially high in 2013 - 14 ( when those delayed receipts were received ) .
Combine those two numbers and you may well explain your Â£7bn jump ...
But itâ€ ™ s not only that Osborne has been a little economical with the truth .
Itâ€ ™ s not only that , on all the available evidence , his tax cut actually cost money .
The whole episode signals a terrible indictment of government policy .
Osborne could have taken measures to prevent these delaying tactics â€ “ which remember only benefited those earning over Â£150,000 per annum .
But he didnâ€ ™ t .
And this cost the country Â£2.4bn in 2012 - 13 : see Table A3 .
The TaxPayersâ€ ™ Alliance has joined those welcoming the findings of the Freedom of Information review , but saying it should have gone further .
This is from its chief executive , Jonathan Isaby .
It is heartening that the government has reiterated its pledge to encourage transparency in the public sector and it is also good news that the government has rejected the self - serving call from councils and local authorities to introduce a fee for each FoI request .
However , the TaxPayersâ€ ™ Alliance will continue to campaign to extend the remit of FoI to any organisation - public or private - which is in receipt of taxpayersâ€ ™ money as hard - pressed families have every right to know how their money is being spent .
Recent cases illustrate the urgent need for much greater transparency in these organisations as well and sadly , todayâ€ ™ s announcement does not appear to address that issue .
The Department for Work and Pensions has announced that it is appointing John Cridland , the former CBI director general , to head a longterm review of the state pension age .
It will consider changes that could come into force after 2028 .
Owen Smith , the shadow work and pensions secretary , says this could lead to rises in the state pension age being speeded up , â€œthrowing into chaos the retirement plans of millions of British workersâ€ � .
In a statement he said : The Tories have a record of failing to be straight with people about the true impact of their pension policy , always keen to trumpet any potential gains from reforms , but reluctant to be honest with those set to lose out .
So people are right to worry that the terms of this review may suggest that the Tory government is set to speed up rises in the state pension age , throwing into chaos the retirement plans of millions of British worker .
Smith has got a point .
Current policy is to increase the state pension age in line with increases in life expectancy , but the terms of reference ( pdf ) suggest the government believes the state pension age needs to rise even faster .
The terms of reference say the review will need to consider .
What a suitable state pension age is , in the immediate future and over the longer term ?
Whether the current system of a universal state pension age rising in line with life expectancy best supports affordability , fairness , and fuller working lives objective ?
And , if not , how state pension age arrangements might better support these objective ?
David Cameron has been making the case for Britain staying in the EU at a St Davidâ€ ™ s Day reception at Number 10 .
I think sometimes we forget some of the more basic arguments .
When I think of the extraordinary strength of Welsh agriculture , and to think that that market of 500 million people means there are no quotas , there are no tariffs , there are no taxes , there are no restrictions - you can sell as much Welsh lamb , Welsh beef , Welsh pork into that market .
Imagine swapping that for the situation that some other countries have outside the European Union , where you have restrictions , you might have quotas , you might have tariffs , and we wouldnâ€ ™ t have access to that market .
He also started quoting from Monty Python .
Imagine what that might mean to Welsh business and Welsh employment .
It is rather like that scene in Monty Pythonâ€ ™ s Life of Brian - â€˜Whatâ€ ™ s Europe ever done for us ?
Well , apart from the market of 500 million people , the regional grants , the access to the market , the support for our universities .
Well other than that ...
â€ ™
I think it is a very strong argument
and I look forward to making it in the months to come .
I have corrected an earlier post ( see 12.46pm ) to make it clear that universities are already covered by Freedom of Information , and that the independent commission is rejecting calls for them to be excluded , not calling for FoI to be extended to cover them .
Ministers have published the report from the independent commission reviewing the Freedom of Information Act .
The report is broadly supportive of how FoI works , confounding fears that it was going to recommend measures that would restrict the scope of FoI.
The government has accepted its recommendation not to introduce a charge for using FoI. Ministers have also rejected - at least , for now - the commissionâ€ ™ s proposal to legislate to toughen ministerial veto powers over FoI. ( See 11.56am and 12.46pm . )
Lord Mandelson has said it would be a â€œfantasyâ€ � and â€œdeeply irresponsibleâ€ � to claim Britainâ€ ™ s trade deals would be better outside the EU .
He made the claim in a major speech on what would happen to trade if Britain left the EU .
In response Matthew Elliott , chief executive of Vote Leave , said : Peter Mandelson told us the British economy would fall off a cliff if we didnâ€ ™ t join the euro and now he is indulging in the same scaremongering about the referendum .
He was wrong then and he is wrong now .
He is starting to resemble a man wearing a sign saying the â€˜end is nighâ€ ™ .
As the prime minister has said - trade will continue after we Vote Leave , Peter Mandelson should stop his scaremongering .
It is safer to take back control and to start to spend our money on our priorities than it is to keep giving more power and money to the EU .
Mandelson has said pro - Brexit ministers denied access to certain government papers should stop â€œwhingingâ€ � .
Commenting on the rule that means they will not be allowed to see papers relating to the EU referendum , he said : We are faced in this country with the biggest choice of our generation , a choice which is going to have a huge impact on our jobs , our trade , our investment , our place in the world .
Frankly , I think , these complaining ministers are lucky .
Usually when members of a government go against ministerial collective responsibility and the will of the cabinet , they receive one paper - and thatâ€ ™ s their P45 .
So I think they have got off rather lightly
and they should stop whinging .
In a separate development , Sir Jonathan Stephens , permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office , told MPs that under these rules his boss might have to use the Freedom of Information Act , or a parliamentary question , to get departmental information .
Theresa Villiers , the Northern Ireland secretary , is campaigning for Britain to leave the EU .
Asked whether he would withhold from Villiers information bearing on the referendum which 10 Downing Street or the Cabinet Office had asked her department to produce , Stephens said : â€œYes .
That information is to be used to support the policy of the government of the day.â€ �
But ministers campaigning for the UK to leave the EU are â€œoperating in a personal capacity and in that respect , if they put in a freedom of information request or a parliamentary question , that will be answered , but they wonâ€ ™ t be receiving the support of the Civil Serviceâ€ � , he told the public administration and constitutional affairs committee .
This afternoon the committee will be taking evidence on this from Sir Jeremy Heywood , the cabinet secretary .
I will be covering that hearing in detail .
Andrew Tyrie , chair of the Commons Treasury committee , has said people should be â€œvery concernedâ€
� about Cameronâ€ ™ s EU renegotiation because it appears to extend the powers of the European Union in relation to financial stability .
( See 10 am . )
Powers for the police to access everyoneâ€ ™ s web browsing histories and to hack into their phones are to be expanded under the latest version of the snooperâ€ ™ s charter legislation .
George Osborne , the chancellor , has confirmed that the Treasury will publish a comprehensive economic analysis of Britainâ€ ™ s membership of the EU before the referendum .
At Treasury questions in the Commons he said leaving the EU would result in a â€œlong , costly and messy divorceâ€ � .
Osborne has said that reducing the top rate of income tax from 50p to 45p raised an additional Â£8bn from the highest earners in its first year .
Speaking in the Commons he said the revelation â€œcompletely defiesâ€ � predictions made by Labour that cutting the rate from 50p to 45p would cost Â£3bn and give top earners an average Â£10,000 tax cut .
HMRC previously estimated that cutting the top rate from 50p to 45p would cost the Exchequer Â£100 m .
Osborne said : Under this government the richest pay a higher proportion of income tax than under the last Labour government .
Indeed we have just had numbers out this morning from HMRC which for the first time show the income tax data for the year 2013/14 , which is when the 50p rate was reduced to 45p .
And what that shows is that actually there was an Â£8bn increase in revenues from additional rate taxpayers , which completely defies the predictions made by the Labour party at the time and shows that what we have are lower , competitive taxes that are paid by all .
Grassroots Conservative associations could be urged to carry out mega - mergers , as the Tory chairman , Lord Feldman , seeks to streamline the party .
The UK government must take steps to tackle air pollution within days or face further legal action , it has been warned .
The Electoral Commission has announced it is extending its investigation into Conservative spending in the Newark , Clacton and Rochester byelections .
Channel 4
Newsâ€ ™ s Michael Crick has broadcast an investigation apparently showing that byelection spending by the party was not properly declared .
The Tories deny this .
The commission only has limited powers to investigate , but it is going to look at whether the hotel bills discovered by Crick were campaign spending , and whether they should have been included in general election or European election spending returns .
Sadiq Khan , Labourâ€ ™ s candidate for London mayor , has repeatedly refused to say that Jeremy Corbyn is an asset to his campaign .
In an interview with LBC he had to be asked seven times if Corbyn was an asset .
Eventually he responded to the question by saying that the new members who joined the party because of Corbyn saw Corbyn as an asset , and that that was helpful to his campaign .
For the tens of thousands who joined the party because of Jeremy Corbyn , theyâ€ ™ ll not unreasonably want to vote for the Labour candidate ...
For those who joined the party because of Jeremy Corbyn , of course he is [ an asset ] .
Khan also played down the prospect of campaigning with Corbyn .
Asked if they would campaign together , he said : Iâ€ ™ m my own man , Jeremy Corbyn , like many others in the Labour party , will be knocking on doors , delivering leaflets , fundraising , coming to phone banks , as are people who arenâ€ ™ t members of the party .
Lady Bone , the businesswoman and Conservative peer , has published a review she conducted for the government into how to increase business start - ups in disadvantaged areas .
It recommends improving the new enterprise allowance and better access to start - up loans .
The campaign group 38 Degrees has welcomed the proposal from the Freedom of Information commission that FoI should be extended to cover public services under contract .
( See 12.46pm . )
Almost 200,000 signed one of its petitions calling for this .
David Babbs , executive director at 38 Degrees , said : Now that the commission has published its recommendations , ministers need to apply them if they want to prove that theyâ€ ™ re on the right side of public opinion .
The government must extend FOI to private companies who receive public money .
Gisela Stuart , the Labour MP who is campaigning to leave the EU , told the Today programme this morning that it was a â€œrather curious reading of historyâ€ � to claim that the EU had kept the peace in Europe .
She told the programme : France and Germany coming together within the envelope of Nato and the collective security - that is what has kept the peace .
What the European Union , up to a certain point , provided for was a political stability within a defence framework .
But if you are looking at what is happening across the European Union now - and the refugee crisis is just the latest demonstration - that political stability is being seriously questioned , and the European Union as an institution is not responding to it properly .
Hereâ€ ™ s Bob Satchwell , director of the Society of Editors , on the outcome of the Freedom of Information review .
Itâ€ ™ s a victory for common sense in that it appears that the government has backed away from putting restrictions on this act which has created a vital public service and particularly allows the media to inform the public about information which they are entitled to know .
Here is some reaction from journalists to the FoI review .
From Newsnightâ€ ™ s Chris Cook From Wired UKâ€ ™ s Matt Burgess From Ian Burrell , the Independentâ€ ™ s media editor Matthew Hancock , the Cabinet Office minister , has already announced that the government will accept some of the Freedom of Information commissionâ€ ™ s recommendations .
( See 11.56am . )
But in the report ( pdf ) there are 21 full recommendations , as well as some interesting unofficial recommendations ( areas where the commission expresses a view , but does not make a formal recommendation either because of lack of evidence , or because the matter is outside its terms of reference ) .
Here are some of the recommendations the commission is making that the government has not yet accepted or rejected .
Formal recommendations Introducing a 20-day limit for authorities that need to extend the time they have to consider FoI requests .
Increasing the penalty for destroying information requested under the FoI , and making it easier for the information commission to prosecute .
Clarifying , and in some respects widening , what can be exempted from disclosure on the grounds that it relates to policy formulation or cabinet discussion .
Getting rid of the first - tier tribunal appeal process .
( There would still be an appeal to an upper tribunal . )
Unofficial recommendations Extending the scope of the FoI to cover public services under contract ( provided the contracts are worth more than Â£5 m . )
Ensuring universities remain covered by FoI. ( Some university bodies have been calling for them to be excluded . )
Interestingly , the commission also recommends that the government legislates to â€œclarify beyond doubtâ€ � that ministers do have the right to veto FoI disclosures .
Hancock has rejected this recommendation - or , at least , temporarily rejected it .
( See 11.56am . )
UPDATE :
I have corrected this post to make it clear that universities are already covered by FoI , and that the commission is rejecting calls for them to be excluded , not calling for FoI to be extended to cover them .
Tom Brake , the Lib Dem MP , has broadly welcomed the Freedom of Information review , but says it should have gone further .
In a statement he says : At the heart of a healthy and vibrant democracy is Freedom of Information .
So the news that Jeremy Heywood and Matthew Hancock have seen sense is welcome .
But it is extremely disappointing that there are no plans to extend FoI.
The government should have seized the opportunity to make private companies , doing public work , subject to FoI.
There is no logic for FoI to apply to work performed by Westminster Council , but not to companies that Westminster Council contract out the same work to .
What is good for the goose must be good for the gander .
The government should also have dumped the powers that enable ministers to overrule the information commissioner and tribunal .
The IC and Tribunal should be the judges of public interest , not ministers .
Ministers tend to claim release is not in the public interest , when what they really mean is that it is not in governmentâ€ ™ s interest
and they are seeking to avoid government embarrassment .
Wired UKâ€ ™ s Matt Burgess
has posted a chart on Twitter summarising what he sees as the good and bad points in the Freedom of Information review .
Here are the main points from Matthew Hancockâ€ ™ s statement about the Freedom of Information review .
Ministers have ruled out legislating to tighten their powers to veto the release of information through FoI - but only â€œat this stageâ€ � .
After the election Downing Street indicated that there was a â€œstrong caseâ€ � for changing the law because a legal challenge by the Guardian journalist Rob Evans , which led to the release of letters written by Prince Charles under FoI , showed that
ministersâ€ ™ veto powers were not as strong as assumed when the Act became law .
Hancock said the government accepted that there should be a â€œnarrower and more limited veto provisionâ€ � .
He said in future ministers would only deply the veto after an information commissioner decision .
He went on : On the basis that this approach proves effective , we will not bring forward legislation at this stage .
Ministers will consider measures to force public bodies to publish more information about the pay and perks of senior staff .
Hancock said people should not have to use FoI to get this information .
Ministers have ruled out introducing FoI charges .
It says the transparency created by FoI can save the taxpayer money .
Hancock said : We appreciate that some public authorities are concerned by the burdens imposed on them by the Act and the associated costs .
However , the introduction of new fees would lead to a reduction in the ability of requesters , especially the media , to make use of the Act .
We believe that transparency can help save taxpayersâ€ ™ money , by driving out waste and inefficiency .
Public authorities will face a new duty to publish information about how they respond to FoI requests .
Hancock said : We know that many other organisations already publish such data , but this does not happen consistently .
The publication of such data not only provides accountability to the public , but allows the Information Commissioner to identify and target poorly performing public authorities more effectively .
We will therefore issue guidance in the revised Section 45 Code of Practice to set a standard that public authorities with 100 full time equivalent employees or more should publish such information .
New guidance will be issued clarifying when authorities can refuse â€œvexatiousâ€ � requests .
Hancock said : The exercise by citizens of legal rights also brings with it responsibilities â€ “ and access to information rights should not be abused to cause distress or a means of harassment .
Equally , the â€œvexatiousâ€ � designation is not an excuse to save public
officialsâ€ ™ embarrassment from poor decisions or inappropriate spending of taxpayersâ€ ™ money .
This will not require legislation .
Updated guidance will be issued on how the FoI works .
Ministers have accepted that â€œpublic interestâ€ � should determine whether risk registers are published .
( The government was criticised for not publishing the risk register relating to the Health and Social Care Act . )
And here is the full report from the independent commission on Freedom of Information ( pdf ) .
It runs to 64 pages .
The government has published the outcome of its Freedom of Information review .
There is a summary here , in a written ministerial statement from Matthew Hancock .
Here is the preview story we wrote earlier .
Lord Mandelsonâ€ ™ s speech this morning was focused entirely on trade .
Those in favour of leaving the EU argue that Britain , as the fifth largest economy in the world , would have no difficulty negotiating free trade deals with other countries if it left the EU and that , without being encumbered by the Brussels bureaucracy , British trade negotiators might even be able to act more quickly than EU trade negotiators .
Drawing on his experience as a former European trade commission , Mandelson argued that they were wrong .
His speech went into a level of detail that most other recent speeches or articles on this topic have missed .
It probably is not for everyone , but if you are even half - interested in the EU trade argument , it is well worth reading .
Here are the key points .
Mandelson said it was a â€œfantasyâ€ � and â€œdeeply irresponsibleâ€ � to claim Britainâ€ ™ s trade deals would be better outside the EU .
As things stand , if we genuinely want to continue embedding UK companies in global supply and value chains , and if we are genuinely serious about continuing to build the UK as a trading base for Europeâ€ ™ s single market , there is no rational or realistic way that Brexit offers a better set of global trade arrangements than those we have already .
Brexiters are trying to sell people a fantasy of what life outside of the EU would look like , without any evidence to back up their assertions .
With the fate of future generations and our countryâ€ ™ s place in the world on the ballot paper it is deeply irresponsible to pretend otherwise .
He said it was important to recognise that there was a difference between being in a single market and having a free trade agreement ( FTA ) .
Those in favour of leaving the EU say Britain could replace being in the single market with having a free trade agreement with the EU .
But they were different things , he said .
I would describe the Single Market as Free Trade Extra
Plus .
The Extra are the common rules and regulations that matter as much as the absence of tariffs .
The Plus is being part of the EUâ€ ™ s decision - making which gives us a big say in how these rules are made and the rights of redress when others do not obey them .
It is this Extra Plus that has led to a boost to the size of the economy .
The Financial Times cites leading economic historian Nick Crafts as suggesting the UK economy is a tenth larger as a result , which is many tens of thousands of jobs in Britain ...
You either accept â€œthe free movement of goods , persons , services and capitalâ€ � of the Single Market or you donâ€ ™ t and if you donâ€ ™ t you are outside the Single Market .
While Brexit campaigners blur the distinction between an FTA and Single Market access , each is distinct , with profound implications , and in this debate they must be treated as such .
He said that if Britain struck a free trade deal with the EU , exporters to the EU could still end up having tariffs imposed on their goods .
Complete tariff removal is not guaranteed in an FTA and even a low tariff can change the calculus of a supply chain in a highly cost - sensitive global economy .
3 % on the cost of a supply chain input can be material .
And for the large volume of trade that we hope would continue , that could be a considerable sum of money .
For every UK company that trades with the EU â€ “ and there are over 200,000 â€ “ this should be a worry , as it would be for every inward investor that sets up in the UK to manufacture for onward sale into the European market .
He said he could not imagine the EU allowing the UK a full free trade deal in services .
It is implausible , for example , to think that we could get most of what we want on services , the biggest sector of the UK economy , where it is not tariffs but regulatory barriers that count .
I can not see the circumstances in which the ECB , post Brexit , would allow London to continue being the centre for clearing euro - denominated trades completely outside their regulatory scope .
He said EU countries would be reluctant to offer the UK unfettered access to their markets .
The key point is that for every European economic interest with a keen stake in the British market there would be another with a competitive advantage in rolling back that British access just a bit , especially in sectors like farming and , of course , financial services , where there will be both Member States and MEPs trying to advance the interests of Frankfurt or Paris at the expense of London .
Continental auto manufacturers , another example , would quickly see the opportunity for them of making British producers face new tariff costs .
They would need to make a commercial judgement vis - a - vis the UK market .
But we should not assume that France , Italy or Spain will vote to allow Vauxhall , Nissan , Honda , Toyota and other UK - based producers tariff free access to the European market when their industries suffer from over - capacity .
Yes , the German large car makers want free access to Britain but they do not call all the shots .
I know from experience that in any trade negotiation defensive interests speak loudest and they are not always overcome .
It is only partly a joke to say that trade deals are launched by liberals but signed by protectionists .
He said that if Britain left the EU , while some countries with EU trade deals might offer the UK the same terms , others would not .
The EU is a gateway for global market access .
Outside it we lose the preferential trading benefits from its trade agreements with over 50 other countries .
It is possible that some will transfer the existing agreement to us without much fuss but others will not feel that what the UK is offering makes it worth their while .
They will make their own calculus .
Overnight , following our departure , those literally hundreds of thousands of zeroed tariffs and improved conditions of market access previously negotiated by the EU in markets like Korea , Canada , Mexico , Colombia , Central America , Singapore , Vietnam , the Euromed basin and the African , Caribbean and Pacific countries and others would be withdrawn and replaced with the costlier , non - preferential , non - privileged market access provided to all ordinary WTO members .
In some cases , that could mean new tariffs of ten , twenty percent or sometimes even more on key UK exports such as cars , machine goods , whisky and textiles .
He said if Britain left the EU it would have to impose tariffs on some imports , pushing up prices .
The UK would also potentially have to raise its own tariffs on imports from these markets [ if it left the EU ] .
Because , having left the EU trade framework and before the UK had replaced it through negotiations of our own , we could not continue to offer the same preferential treatment to goods entering Britain under the original EU agreements .
This is because we would be breaking WTO rules which require , outside preferential agreements , treating all fellow WTO members the same , without discrimination .
So one of the first acts of a UK outside of the EU would actually be to increase border protection because we are no longer covered by EU agreements , raising the cost of imported goods and consumer prices .
He said negotiating trade deals with countries outside the EU would be harder than some Brexit campaigners think .
Yes , we could try to negotiate duplicate agreements with Korea and others .
I donâ€
™ t know how many of you have had the pleasure of negotiating with the Koreans , but I have .
They are charming â€ “ but utterly tough .
We would have to persuade them to offer the same terms as they offered the EU â€ “ but with less leverage .
He said Britain had a shortage of trade negotiators , which was an added problem .
And there is a practical problem here too .
After our years in the EU , the UK has no real trade negotiating capacity
â€ “ it would first have to be rebuilt .
If we left , the UK would be ill equipped
to re - build the status quo let alone forge new agreements which some imagine are within our grasp .
He said Norway used to ask him , as EUâ€ ™ s trade commissioner , to represent its interests in trade talks .
We must not fall into the trap of confusing Britainâ€ ™ s genuine cultural and soft power influence with weight at the trade negotiating table .
How often do I remember the Norwegian foreign minister grabbing my arm as I went into trade negotiations asking me to represent his countryâ€ ™ s interests because Norway did not have a seat at the negotiating table .
He ridiculed Boris Johnson for comparing himself to James Bond in relation to his EU stance .
It would be thoroughly reckless for Britain to sacrifice the settled network of trade advantages and preferences we have built up over decades , just for the thrill of a dare devil race round the international circuit in our own Aston Martin , as Boris aspires to .
He was referring to a line Johnson used in an interview with the Times at the weekend .
Lord Mandelson has delivered his speech on Europe .
According to some of the journalists who were listening , some of it sounded a bit clunky .
This is from the BBCâ€ ™ s James Landale .
And this is from Bloombergâ€ ™ s Rob Hutton .
Iâ€ ™ m just reading the speech now .
I will post a summary soon .
Another foreign leader has entered the debate about Brexit .
As Andrew MacDowall reports for Politico , Kosovoâ€ ™ s president - elect , Hashim ThaÃ§i , has said Britainâ€ ™ s departure from the EU could trigger â€œa chain reactionâ€ � with potentially dangerous consequences for the Balkans .
ThaÃ§i told Politico : I very well understand internal political developments [ in Britain ] , but the EU without Britain would lose its meaning .
It can cause a chain reaction within the EU .
Thatâ€ ™ s the softest way of putting it ...
For all its shortcomings , the EU is still the only alternative for Kosovo and the region .
What are the other options ?
If thereâ€ ™ s no EU integration , the region might withdraw to nationalism and the idea of redrawing borders .
This will cause more problems , more crisis and more suffering , beyond any of our abilities to comprehend .
Lord Hill , Britainâ€ ™ s European commissioner , is giving evidence to the Commons Treasury committee about the costs and benefits of EU membership .
Hill is responsible for â€œfinancial stability , financial services and capital markets unionâ€ �
and we were expecting the hearing to get bogged down in complex financial technicalities .
But the hearing opened with some drama .
Andrew Tyrie , the Conservative MP who chairs the committee , ambushed Hill with a question about the EU renegotiation and then criticised him for not being on top of his brief .
Here are the key points .
Tyrie said people should be â€œvery concernedâ€ � about Cameronâ€ ™ s EU renegotiation because it appears to extend the powers of the European Union in relation to financial stability .
He criticised Lord Hill , the financial stability commissioner , for not being able to explain a key phrase in the renegotiation document .
The problem started for Hill when Tyrie said that there was nothing in the existing EU treaties giving the EU power in relation to financial stability .
Then he asked Hill about a line in the renegotiation document .
I note that in this agreement that has been agreed it says that while financial stability is â€œa matter for their own authoritiesâ€ � , thatâ€ ™ s the authorities of member states , that responsibility that lies with member states should be â€œwithout prejudice to the existing powers of the union to take action that is necessary to respond to threats to financial stabilityâ€ � .
That looks like competence creep to me .
It looks like an extension of responsibility taking place under the guise of something that is reinforcing protection for the UK .
What response to you have to give to that ?
Hill said that he did not see this as an example of â€œcompetence creepâ€ � , but he was unable to explain to Tyrie what the phrase â€œwithout prejudice to the existing powers of the unionâ€ � meant .
He told Tyrie : Iâ€ ™ m afraid that without having that text Iâ€ ™ m not able to give you a very satisfactory answer .
Tyrie then criticised him for not knowing his subject .
I think this is pretty crucial .
If you donâ€ ™ t mind my saying so ,
Iâ€ ™ m a bit concerned that you are not completely up to speed with what the scope and limits of what appears to be an extension of union powers in the field of financial stability is as a consequence of that language that is now going to be in treaty form , lodged with the UN , and subsequently embodied in the union treaties .
In this context , telling someone like Hill he is â€œnot completely up to speedâ€
�
with an issue amounts to a severe accusation of incompetence .
Tyrie went on :
So we should be very concerned indeed , it seems to me .
This agreement , from a British perspective , appears to have protection followed swiftly by what its detractors could easily describe as a Trojan horse of competence creep .
Tyrie asked Hill to write to the committee with a considered explanation , which Hill agreed to do .
The Telegaphâ€ ™ s Asa Bennett points out that Lord Mandelson may not be the most persuasive salesman for the Remain camp .
He cites this Survation research from 2013 , which found that Mandelsonâ€ ™ s approach to Europe was seen as far less popular than David Cameronâ€ ™ s ,
Margaret Thatcherâ€ ™ s , Ed Milibandâ€ ™ s , Tony Blairâ€ ™ s or Nick Cleggâ€ ™ s .
And a YouGov survey for the Times before the election also found that supporters of all the main parties view an endorsement from Mandelson as more of a liability than an asset .
Lord Mandelson , the Labour former business secretary and former European trade commissioner , is giving a speech on Europe this morning .
No one will be surprised to learn that he is in favour of Britain staying in the EU - for years he has been one of the high priests of Anglo - Europhilia - but his background gives him more authority to speak on this subject than most others who have been contributing .
He was on the Today programme previewing what he will say .
Here are the key points .
Mandelson said it could take Britain up to seven years to negotiate new trade deals .
Those in favour of Brexit say that it would not take long for the UK to negotiate a trade deal with the EU if it voted to leave because it would be in the EUâ€ ™ s interests to sort the issue out quickly .
Mandelson said it was not as simple as that .
Any idiot can start a trade agreement .
The question is where does it end up ?
You can deal with tariffs relatively easily .
What is much harder to deal with are the behind - the - border regulatory barriers .
And the more you want to reduce both border tariff barriers and regulatory barriers , the longer and more complex it is , and the harder the negotiation is .
And that is why on average a free trade agreement takes between four and seven years , sometimes much longer , to negotiate .
He said Lord Lawson , the chair of Vote Leave , was talking â€œabsolute rubbishâ€
� when he said the UK would just inherit the trade deals the EU had struck up with non - EU countries if it voted to leave the EU .
That was not the case , Mandelson said .
He said those agreements were EU ones , not British ones .
Lawson was â€œengaging in fantasy
politicsâ€ � , he said .
Mandelson said leaving the EU would â€œdamage British businessâ€ � .
It is clear to me , I have reached the conclusion , that the political aims of those who are seeking to leave the European Union will undoubtedly damage British business , British jobs and British investment .
He said the Out camp could not explain what Britianâ€ ™ s relationship with the EU would be like if it left .
The point about the Leave campaigners is they are really not giving an answer to what Out would look like , what situation would we be in if we were not in the European Union .
And I think the reason they are not doing that is because they are torn between their obsession with what they call Britainâ€ ™ s autonomy , Britainâ€ ™ s independence - some would say isolation - on the one hand , and their desire to pretend that we will not lose trade and jobs as a result of leaving .
Now , I donâ€
™ t think you can have it both ways .
Therefore what they are doing is ducking the issue , or saying different things to different people at different times .
Here is the agenda for the day .

If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter , Iâ€ ™ m on @AndrewSparrow .
I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all .
If you have a direct question , do include â€œAndrewâ€ � in it somewhere and Iâ€ ™ m more likely to find it .
I do try to answer direct questions , although sometimes I miss them or donâ€ ™ t have time .
Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter .
If you think there are any voices that Iâ€ ™ m leaving out , particularly political figures or organisations giving alternative views of the stories Iâ€ ™ m covering , do please flag them up below the line ( include â€œAndrewâ€ � in the post ) .
I canâ€ ™ t promise to include everything , but I do try to be open to as wide a range of perspectives as possible ."
2016-03-13,"A few weeks ago , in this space , we discussed Prince Williamâ€ ™ s views on the European Union .
The prince had made a few bland remarks that the pro - EU lobby hailed as pro - EU , while the anti - EU lobby declared them obviously anti - EU .
At the time , I was tickled to watch the different groups project their own views on to the completely blank canvas of the princeâ€ ™ s vague remarks .
But now that the exact same thing is happening with the Queen , it raises a different question entirely .
There is dispute over a conversation between the Queen and some government ministers at a lunch in 2011 .
According to the Sun newspaper , in a story hotly tipped to have been leaked by the anti - EU Michael Gove , the Queen implied she was in favour of Brexit .
But the pro - EU Nick Clegg , who was also at the lunch , swears she didnâ€ ™ t
â€ “ and his colleague , Lib Dem ex - minister Sir Edward Davey , says he is sure the Queen would vote to remain .
As Sir Ed would .
So , once again , as with Prince William , the Queenâ€ ™ s views are in the eye of the beholder .
That would mean that if , for example , I were to leak Her Majestyâ€ ™ s opinions to the tabloid press , I would reveal that the Queen is baffled by the whole European thing , worries that either route could lead to disaster , isnâ€ ™ t a clairvoyant and doesnâ€ ™ t have a clue one way or the bloody other .
What strikes me now , though , is the fact that we are discussing where the royal family stands on this at all .
Itâ€ ™ s so weird !
Why on earth would it matter ?
Donâ€ ™ t get me wrong , I am an ardent monarchist , but not because I think they know anything .
Quite the reverse : my amused affection for the concept of a royal family is entirely based on how removed , tangential and oddly
â€œotherâ€ � they are .
The whole point is that they live in a world where crowns are hats , where loos smell of fresh paint , where foreigners perform topless dances of welcome , where dogs are effectively people and toothpaste is applied to brushes by valets ; a world where there are moats and bowing , and swans are pets .
How can our own views possibly be affected by what the Queen thinks of free trade with Luxembourg ?
Itâ€ ™ s like wanting to know what Zippy and Bungle think .
The Queen is not a real person .
Not as far as weâ€ ™ re concerned .
We have the same relationship with her that we do with Mickey Mouse or Doctor
Who : we donâ€
™ t empathise or relate , we enjoy the colour and spectacle from afar .
Sheâ€ ™ s a wonderful character , nothing to do with the real world .
When vested interests exploit the Queenâ€ ™ s popularity by imposing their views on hers , itâ€ ™ s like Omega putting a watch on James Bond .
If you actually then want to wear that watch , youâ€ ™ re an idiot .
With that in mind , I have asked both camps whether they know of any opinions privately expressed by anybody else we might care aboutâ€ ¦ Alice in Wonderland â€œReading between the lines , Alice is hugely in favour of Brexit , â€ � explains Peter Bone MP .
â€œHer view is that the relaxation of border control is all very inviting to begin with , but you are soon overrun by grinning cats , mice in the teapot and caterpillars smoking their weird hookah pipes in broad daylight.â€
�
â€œThis is the very opposite of the caseâ€ � , counters Ken Clarke .
â€œAlice herself has implied to me , very strongly , that an exit vote would see us sleepwalking to disaster.â€ �
Paddington Bear â€œPaddington believes a jobs boom would result from being freed of EU red tape , â€ � says Nigel Farage , who met him at a dinner party .
â€œNot only that , but those jobs would go to actual British people , which is better.â€ � â€œBullshit !
Or should I say bear shit?â€ � coughs Nick Clegg , who was at the same dinner .
â€œThe exact opposite was implied ; the ursine view is that jobs would be lost if we ceased to compete from within the EU .
What Nigel forgets is that Paddington is , himself , an immigrant.â€ �
Luke Skywalker â€œA strong believer in national
sovereignty!â€ � Michael Gove reveals .
â€œLuke is onside with us , doing everything he can to overcome the threat of a shadowy unelected ruling elite .
Iâ€ ™ m saying the EU is like Darth Vader.â€ �
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know where Michael is getting his information from , â€ � scoffs David Cameron .
â€œIt is Darth Vader whose attempts to suppress the rebel alliance reek of isolationism .
I have it on good authority that Luke Skywalker wants increased galactic unity.â€ �
Mr Toad â€œToad is terrified that the British people will vote â€˜outâ€ ™ ,â€ � divulges Lord Mandelson .
â€œHe makes the radical point that we actually need the humanity of the European courts to overrule our own corrupt and horrible and stupid and mean judges.â€ � â€œPiffle - paffle , Toady is
a great patriot!,â€ � scoffs Boris Johnson .
â€œI met him at a motor show where he clearly indicated to me that he hopes Britain grabs back the power to self - determine .
You simply canâ€ ™ t be giving in , he told me , to these weasels.â€ �
Elizabeth Bennett â€œSheâ€ ™ s
voting no
, â€ �
lets slip Bill Cash MP .
â€œShe talked to me at a quadrille about the beauty of Norway and Switzerland , which clearly suggested she admires the way those countries have thrived outside the EU.â€ � â€œBollocks , â€ � says Shirley Williams .
â€œRemember ,
Elizabeth Bennett doesnâ€ ™ t even have the f***ing vote.â€

2016-03-15,"The worldâ€ ™ s largest shipping and airline companies , port operators and transport groups will commit on Tuesday to trying to shut down the main international wildlife trafficking routes .
The initiative , to be signed by 40 organisations , is led by Prince William and backed by the worldâ€ ™ s largest conservation groups including Conservation International and WWF .
By sharing information on suspected traffickers , working with customs and enforcement authorities , training cargo staff on what to look out for and refusing to ship suspect cargos , they hope to strangle the $ 19bn ( Â£13bn ) a year illegal wildlife trade which has brought populations of many endangered species including tigers and elephants to the brink of extinction .
The initiative from the United for Wildlife taskforce , which is chaired by Prince William , follows a 2015 report from the wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic .
This showed that even though national law enforcement was improving and illegal shipments were being seized , loopholes and shifting trade patterns meant that the volume of the multi - billion dollar trade has not diminished .
The Buckingham Palace declaration , to be signed today , will see companies and trade bodies sign up to 11 principles amounting to what is being called a â€œzero
toleranceâ€ �
 policy towards the trade .
They include Maersk , the worldâ€ ™ s biggest shipping company , Abu Dhabi - based port operator DP World which owns 70 of the worldâ€ ™ s largest maritime ports , Emirates Airlines , DHL , cruise liners , international custom groups and international trade bodies .
Prince William has become a leading advocate against poaching and the illegal wildlife trade , having briefed Obama , Chinese premier Xi Jinping , World Bank president Jim Yong Kim and other world leaders in the past 18 months .
A Kensington palace spokesman said that the princeâ€ ™ s attempt to stop the massacre of wildlife is an important test for his generationâ€ ™ s ability to solve future complex global challenges .
â€œCriminals are able to exploit weak and corrupt standards , so we must raise those standards , collectively .
Cooperation is our greatest weapon against the poachers and traffickers who rely on evading individual national initiatives .
By taking a truly international approach , we can get one step ahead of them ,
â€ � the prince told a World Bank meeting last year .
Today the prince said humanity had 10 years to save animals such as the rhino : â€œIn the next 5 - 10 years if thereâ€ ™ s not a massive change , a dramatic change in the way we appreciate and protect these iconic species in Africa there wonâ€ ™ t be these incredible animals there , which not only is obviously sad for future generations
but I think it would be incredibly devastating for humanity itself when we have sat back
and we have lost something we have been responsible for.â€ �
He told ITV : â€œIf we havenâ€ ™ t achieved something in the next 5 - 10 years then it will be almost impossible to do anything after that .
Because the numbers will be so depleted the damage will be done so badly and clearly the demand wonâ€ ™ t have been halted.â€ � Figures published last week showed a record number of African rhino were killed in 2015 .
The chances of closing the trade depend on cutting off supply routes but also also stopping poaching and the sale of wildlife parts .
Research shows there is a relative concentration of transit points along the supply chain from Africa to Asian consumer markets .
The bulk of the trade may involve as few as 100 - 200 shipping containers a year ,
10 â€œchokepointâ€ �
 transhipment ports , and three airports .
If the transport industry can identify those transit points , enforce regulation and cooperate with the private sector then they could begin to clamp down on illegal wildlife trafficking .
Wildlife groups said the initiative gives some hope to stopping poaching .
â€œThere are today over 1.1bn international tourist arrivals a year ; 100,000 flights every day ; and 500 m containers shipped a year .
The Dukeâ€ ™ s transport task force has filled a gap in the global efforts to stop illicit wildlife trafficking , â€ � said John E Scanlon , secretary general of Cites , the wildlife trade treaty .
Glyn Davies , WWF conservation director said : â€œThis is really valuable and practical because it is the leaders of very big companies who are acting .
Passengers will be told what to avoid , cargo staff are being trained what to look out for .
People know about the transport of drugs and firearms , but now it will be wildlife , too.â€ �
Former foreign secreatary Lord Hague , who chairs the United for Wildlife taskforce and hosted a major wildlife summit in London in 2014 , said : â€œThis is more than just an environmental issue .
The illegal wildlife trade is now recognised as a serious and organised transnational crime .
It drives corruption , is linked to money laundering and can damage economic development in many of
the worldâ€ ™ s poorest countries and communities.â€ �
Sir Tim Clark , president of Emirates Airline , said : â€œMany animals , in particular African elephants , rhinos , tigers , and pangolins , are under extreme pressure because of an unprecedented spike in the illegal wildlife trade.â€ �"
2016-03-16,"Conservationists have hit out at Prince William after the heir to the throne claimed that trophy hunting of animals could be justified in certain circumstances .
The Duke of Cambridge said in an interview for ITV News that commercial hunting could have a positive impact on efforts to save endangered species .
â€œSo when [ an animal ] is infertile , heâ€ ™ s at the end of his life , if somebody out there wants to pay that money â€ “
and it wouldnâ€ ™ t be me â€
“
but if somebody did , then as long as that money goes back into protection of the species then it is a justifiable means of conserving species that are under serious threat ,
â€ � he said .
The prince also said that there was a link between poaching and terrorism , and called for action to break any connection between the two .
He added : â€œIn certain areas there is potential evidence and links that I canâ€ ™ t go into myself but I know of that are of a concern that I think we should be taking more urgent action.â€ �
The UK - based charity Lion Aid was among those leading the criticism , describing William comments as a â€œsad dayâ€ � .
It added in a statement : â€œWith likely less than 15,000 wild lions left in Africa , there is no place for commercial hunting of lions .
With an estimated 1,500 wild male lions in existence and with current â€˜offtakeâ€ ™ for trophy hunting of 300 per annum , continued trophy hunting can not be deemed as sustainable .
â€œA lion of six years of age is not â€˜post reproductionâ€ ™ , in fact it is just coming into his maturity , yet it is at this age most African Countries offer these prime males as trophy.â€
�
The prince was also criticised in 2014 when he went on a deer and wild boar hunting trip in Spain a day before he launched a high - profile appeal to stop the illegal hunting of wildlife .
There was no suggestion the hunting trip was in any way illegal , but critics suggested that the timing of the holiday was poor , coming before an appeal close to the princeâ€ ™ s heart .
The prince also used the interview to respond to accusations that he is work - shy by saying such criticisms are â€œpart of the jobâ€ � .
The 33-year - old has been dubbed a part - time royal by some critics after it was reported he had carried out just 87 appearances in the UK last year and 35 on overseas trips , compared to his elderly grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh , who carried out 250 .
It had been claimed the Duke , who works as an air ambulance pilot , is prevented from carrying out more royal duties on his days off because of European red tape , but this was denied by the Civil Aviation Authority .
Pictures of the Cambridges on a skiing trip in the Alps with Prince George and Princess Charlotte also provoked anger ."
2016-04-10,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were joined by some of Indiaâ€ ™ s biggest film stars , sporting heroes and business people for a charity gala at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Mumbai , which wrapped up the first day of their tour of India and Bhutan .
Bollywood stars Shahrukh Khan and Aishwarya Rai and cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar were among those who joined Will and Kate at the fundraising event at the end of their first day in India on Sunday .
Proceeds from the gala will support three childrenâ€ ™ s charities , Magic Bus , ChildLine and Doorstep .
According to reports , the couple turned down an invitation to stay in a Â£9,500-a night Tata suite , as the company is preparing to withdraw its UK steel operations , putting thousands of British jobs at risk .
The gala , which is being held at the Tata - owned hotel , will not be attended by Tata chairman Cyrus Mistry or members of the Tata family .
The Guardian made attempts to contact the Taj , but has not been able to confirm reports independently .
The trip is one of few foreign royal engagements this year .
According to the palace press team , Will and Kate have wanted to come to India since they married five years ago .
The pair will spend a week touring India .
On the last day of the trip , they will visit the Taj Mahal , where Princess Diana was famously photographed on a solo trip to the country in 1992 .
The trip to the Taj Mahal has also caused controversy in the country , after a report in the Times of India said that officials had asked for scaffolding at the monument to be taken down ahead of the royal visit , so the couple could have their picture taken in front of it .
Taking down the scaffolding , according to conservationists would undo months of work at the monument .
The Foreign Office has denied that any such request was made .
According to a statement , William â€œfeels incredibly lucky to visit a place where his motherâ€ ™ s memory is kept alive by so many who travel thereâ€ � .
The pair arrived in Mumbai on Sunday morning , and have spent their first day touring the cityâ€ ™ s slums and playing cricket and football with underprivileged children from the area .
They visited the Oval Maidan â€ “ a recreational ground in the south of the city â€ “ and the historic Banganga water tank .
They are staying at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel , which was the scene of a deadly terrorist attack in 2008 , claiming the lives of 166 people .
Police were on high terror alert ahead of their visit .
The hotel overlooks the Gateway of India , which was built to commemorate the visit of Prince Williamâ€ ™ s great - grandparents , King George V and Queen Mary to Mumbai in 1911 , when India was part of the British raj .
On Monday , the pair will travel to Delhi , where they will pay respects to the 70,000 Indian soldiers who fought for Britain in the first world war and meet with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi .
They will celebrate the Queenâ€ ™ s birthday at an event in the Indian capital .
They will also tour the Kaziranga national park , home of the endangered one - horned rhino and meet wildlife rangers who defend them from poachers .
In Bhutan , the couple will be received by national musicians and have a private dinner at Lingkana palace hosted by the king and queen of Bhutan .
They will also watch an archery competition ."
2016-04-13,"The royal visit by Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge to an Indian wildlife reserve on Wednesday has divided conservationists and human rights groups because of the parkâ€ ™ s controversial policy of shooting suspected poachers on sight .
Kaziranga park , which borders the Brahmaputra river in Assam , north - east India , has been held up by India and many conservationists as a model of how to protect endangered wildlife .
Despite being under attack by armed poachers , who can earn $ 20,000 from a single rhino horn , it holds two - thirds of the worldâ€ ™
s remaining one - horned rhinos and has the the highest density of tigers in any protected area in the world .
It is also home to large breeding populations of elephants .
But while its 1,200 guards successfully deter much poaching , Kaziranga has become notorious for its militaristic â€œshoot - to - killâ€ � approach to conservation .
According to Indian government records , 66 suspected poachers were killed by guards in the park between 2005 - 2012 and 500 people arrested .
In that time , 134 rhino were killed and 70 rhino horns recovered .
Six rhinos have been killed by poachers so far this year and 20 were killed in 2015 .
Prince William was said by Indian officials to have asked asked the forest rangers about the conservation challenges they face .
The rangers told him that the poachers were using sophisticated automatic weapons , whereas the forest guards had old rifles .
But , say local villagers and human right groups , many innocent tribal people who have lived in or near the park for centuries and have been accustomed to collecting wood or fruits from Kazirangaâ€ ™ s 430 square kilometres , have also been killed or shot on sight .
In 2013 demonstrations were held in neighbouring towns after one local youth was killed and others wounded .
No forest rangers have died .
According to Survival International director , Stephen Corry , conservation in India is becoming militarised and local tribal peoples are being caught in the crossfire , evicted from wildlife parks to make room for animals and large - scale tourism , and shot if they enter areas they used to occupy .
The fear is that the policy in Kaziranga will be spread across other tiger and wildlife reserves , says Corry .
â€œExtrajudicial killings should have no place in conservation today .
Why arenâ€ ™ t
the big conservation organisations loudly condemning this kind of kneejerk brutality?â€ � he said .
In an interview last year with Indian wildlife magazine Sanctuary Asia , Bishan Singh Bonal , then director of Kaziranga and now head of the Indian National Tiger Conservation Authority , defended the policy .
â€œ[What has won the respect of the world at Kaziranga is ] our determination and almost religious belief that protecting the rhino is the only reason to live .
â€œItâ€ ™ s open war when poachers enter Kaziranga .
If they see our guards , they fire to kill , so we have no option but to retaliate .
Kazirangaâ€ ™ s field staff are under immense pressure .
It is one of the states that offers immunity from prosecution when firearms are used by the Forest Department.â€ �
But international rhino conservation group Save the Rhino says killing poachers should only be used as a last resort .
â€œA â€˜shoot - to - killâ€ ™ policy should be used only as a last act and in self - defence .
Anti - poaching rangers must first do all they can to avoid this .
In the event of a contact ( a ranger meeting a poacher ) , it would be much more beneficial if they were caught and arrested , giving the opportunity to recover valuable information about who has commissioned them to turn to poaching , information about the supply chain , and smuggling routes , â€ � says the group on its website .
Save the Rhino states that Kaziranga forest guards receive a cash bonus to their salary if they successfully wound or kill a poacher .
â€œThis stance has affected funding ; indeed this policy caused the BBC Wildlife Fund to pull out of planned funding for the programme a couple of years ago , â€ � says Save the Rhino .
The fund , set up in 2007 to celebrate 50 years of the corporationâ€ ™ s famous Natural History Unit , was disbanded in 2012 .
â€œThe first priority is to capture poachers alive and get intelligence of their smuggling routes .
It is possible that in Kaziranga armed rebel groups are targeting rhino in Kaziranga to fund their independence struggles , â€ � said Cathy Dean , international director of the Save the Rhino .
The International Animal Rescue Foundation in South Africa says on its website that , like Save the Rhino , it only supports a shoot - to - kill when every last option has been exhausted or if the ranger / anti - poaching unit comes under such fierce firepower that their only method of defence is to take the poachers out .
Resentment against Kaziranga park has built up in the surrounding area following a series of major park expansions in recent years .
More than 20,000 people - most of whom are impoverished tribals who have lived in the low - lying areas for generations - are expected to be evicted .
In addition , wild animals raid local community food crops .
â€œTribal peoples are the best conservationists and guardians of the natural world .
Targeting tribes diverts action away from tackling the true poachers â€ “ criminal gangs selling to international markets .
As the â€˜eyes and earsâ€ ™ of the forest , tribal people are best placed to prevent , catch and report poachers , â€ � said Corry ."
2016-04-16,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the Taj Mahal in Agra on Saturday , the final day of their week - long tour of India and Bhutan , in an overt tribute to Diana , Princess of Wales .
Prince William and his wife , Catherine , retraced the steps of his mother , Princess Diana , who travelled there 24 years ago on an infamous visit without her then husband , Prince Charles .
Photographs of the princess visiting the monument alone in 1992 were widely interpreted as a sign of early tensions in the coupleâ€ ™ s marriage and distance between Diana and Buckingham Palace .
She divorced from Prince Charles four years after the trip , and died in a car accident in Paris a year later , aged 36 .
One particular image , which showed the princess sitting alone outside the Taj Mahal on a bench that later would be renamed in her honour , has been remembered as an iconic moment in the modern history of the royal family .
Visiting the monument for the first time William and the Catherine hoped to create â€œnew memoriesâ€ � , a spokesman said .
They were pictured on the â€œprincess Diana benchâ€ � shortly after arriving at the site on Saturday morning .
In a nod to the significance of the visit , a statement released ahead of the duke and duchessâ€ ™ s tour of India said : â€œThe Duke of Cambridge is of course aware of the huge esteem his mother , the late Princess of Wales , is held in India and he appreciates the iconic status of the images that exist of the princess at the Taj .
â€œHe feels incredibly lucky to visit a place where his motherâ€ ™ s memory is kept alive by so many who travel there.â€ �
The monument was built as a gesture of love in 1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a final resting place for his favourite wife Mumtaz , and the couple were given a tour of the mausoleum , which contains the tombs of the two lovers .
Their visit to the Taj was met with some controversy last week .
According to the Times of India newspaper , officials handling the royal tour requested scaffolding at the site be taken down .
Conservators say doing so would undo years of work .
The Foreign Office said that no such request was made .
The royal tour of India included visits to some of the countryâ€ ™ s slums , meetings with Bollywood celebrities and a safari in the Kaziranga national park , which has the worldâ€ ™ s largest population of one - horned rhinos and some of the worldâ€ ™ s last Bengal tigers .
This article was corrected on 31 July 2017 .
It was conservators who objected to the removal of scaffolding , not conservationists ."
2016-04-16,"It was rumoured in Agra that , during the 1971 war between India and Pakistan , Pakistani bombers would be guided to their target by the gleaming marble of the Taj Mahal .
Yet it stands as a towering example of how Islamic culture is so organically part of Indiaâ€ ™ s heritage , despite the sometimes uneasy relationship between the two countries .
I am sure that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will have no such thoughts of territorial dispute in mind when they visit Agra today , but for many of us who have been following Prince Williamâ€ ™ s first visit to India , we can not help but be reminded that his great - great uncle , Lord Louis Mountbatten , the last Viceroy of India and mentor to Prince Charles , presided over the independence of India and birth of Pakistan â€ “ events that have shaped our entire lives .
For 300 years , the British in India exerted a profound influence .
Prince Williamâ€ ™ s ancestors ruled my homeland efficiently and ruthlessly , and my ancestors supported that rule , holding senior posts in the British - Indian police force and army .
But by the end of the second world war , the empire was politically and economically untenable .
In India the imperial policy of divide and rule had flowered into evergrowing sectarian violence .
Although many , like Churchill , felt that Indians were unfit to govern themselves ( â€œa beastly people with a beastly religionâ€ � ) , Mountbatten was appointed by King George VI as his viceroy , and charged with peacefully transferring power from Britain to India .
In so doing , Mountbatten agreed the division of the country on religious grounds : the separation of Hindus and Sikhs from Muslims to create a new Islamic country , Pakistan .
Partition , as it became known , sees its 70th anniversary next year .
It involved the largest mass migration in human history , as 14 million people were displaced , and up to a million died as a result of sectarian violence , starvation and disease .
Half of the Punjab was given to Pakistan , and my Sikh relatives and their Hindu friends suddenly found their homes were no longer in India .
They fled for their lives in the clothes they were wearing , grabbing what possessions they could carry .
The homes they abandoned would soon provide shelter for Muslim refugees , themselves fleeing from violence in India .
My uncles and aunts were only small children when they were forced to flee .
My fatherâ€ ™ s youngest sister never made it â€ “
she starved to death .
My aunt , who now lives in the leafy English town of Chertsey in Surrey , remembers , aged 10 , watching her mother , my grandmother , wrap her dead child in a yard of cotton and place a heavy stone on her chest so that she would sink to the bottom of the river that was to be her grave .
I find it extraordinary that anyone could come to terms with the tragedy that flowed from such sectarian violence .
Yet when I was growing up in a corner shop in London , my dad had longstanding customers who would come round in the evenings to keep him company in the shop .
Most of them were not fellow Sikhs .
They were Muslims from his ancestral town .
I didnâ€
™ t think much about it as a child , but that sense of a common humanity , spanning the religious divide , really struck me in 2005 when I went to Pakistan to find my grandfatherâ€ ™ s home for the BBCâ€ ™ s
Who Do You Think You Are ? programme .
When we eventually found the house , it had become home to several Muslim families whose parents had all fled India during partition .
One woman handed me a shawl and a bouquet of bright plastic flowers , saying : â€œMy family came from India in 1947 .
I am Indian like you.â€ �
Then an old Pakistani man smiled and said : â€œThis is your home , please come back any time .
We will be watching the road waiting for your return.â€ �
I burst into uncontrollable tears , tears held back over years of trying to contain the injustices of history to which my family had been subject , tears now released as I wept with the inhabitants of my ancestral homeland , now a different country , but one where we still shared the same Punjabi language and sense of family .
It was at that moment that I vowed I would make a film that told the story of partition .
Although I had been a film - maker for many years , I had never had the courage to tackle the political tragedy that tore my family apart .
As I researched the script , I also began to realise how little I really knew of the bigger picture , of the global interests at play as India was divided .
One book in particular was revelatory :
The Shadow of the Great Game by Narendra Singh Sarila .
Narendra had been aide de camp to Mountbatten .
In 1997 he was in the British Library researching a book about his family when he was approached by an Indian librarian .
She had been given a box of papers to index
â€ “ secret government documents that had recently been declassified .
The documents appeared to confirm a secret strategy for the protection of British interests in Asia that inexorably led to partition .
So much for it being the fault of the warring Indians , as I had been taught at school in London , or principally the fault of Mountbatten , as many of my relatives believed .
It was far more complex , and this revelation provided me with a way into the story .
By setting the entire film in Viceroyâ€ ™ s House in Delhi , I was able to bring under one roof the Mountbattens , the key Indian leaders ( Nehru , Jinnah and Gandhi ) , and the 500 ordinary Indians Hindu , Sikh and Muslim â€ “ who served the Mountbattens as domestic staff .
To reach a global audience , I knew that I had to make my film entertaining and accessible .
What better way than to visually embrace the splendour of the Raj , of Viceroyâ€ ™ s House , and to use humour and passion to tell a tale of upstairs and downstairs life in the grand tradition of Gosford Park and Downton Abbey .
In the microcosm of that great house , I was able to explore the multiple points of view of the protagonists , and grapple with the idea of partition without being overwhelmed by its tragedy .
I do not believe that anyone but a British Indian â€ “ a product of Britain and Indiaâ€ ™ s inextricable links
â€ “ could truly inhabit these differing perspectives .
I only hope that I do them justice .
After five years of research and development , I will complete the film at the end of this year .
I will have written my history , the history of my family , intertwined with that of Prince Williamâ€ ™ s great - great uncle and the end of the Raj .
As a British - Indian woman , I doubt Churchill had me in mind when he said : â€œHistory is written by the victors.â€ �"
2016-04-22,"To Pinewood Studios , and a picture best captioned :
â€œOH GOD JUST BRING BACK THE EFFING TRADE FEDERATIONâ€ � .
The snap is datelined Tuesday , when Prince William was green - screened into the appearance of doing a dayâ€ ™ s work by the state - of - the - art special effects team on the Star Wars sequel trilogy .
Behold , Darth Workshy and his mildly racist sidekick , sparring in a sequence likely to throw individuals from Jar Jar Binks to bratty Anakin Jr into somewhat sympathetic relief .
But weâ€ ™ re running ahead of ourselves .
Convention demands we set the scene with a slowly receding opening crawl , so here goes â€ ¦
These are troubled times for the empire .
Unrest at Darth Workshyâ€ ™ s Â£4.5 m private quarters refurbishment and three - hours - a - week gig as a tauntaun search - and - rescue operative in the Hoth system has spread throughout the galaxy .

Though Witchell declines to go full rogue , and sneer : â€œI find your lack of activity disturbingâ€ � , Darth Workshyâ€ ™ s failure to deploy the Force choke on him indicates an emerging authority vacuum at the heart of the empire .

Same as it ever was , yet all very much TO BE CONTINUED ."
2016-05-22,"An X Factor singer had to make an embarrassing apology after missing her cue to sing the national anthem in front of 90,000 people at the FA Cup final .
Karen Harding stood awkwardly on a podium waiting for her cue only to realise that she had missed it and only sang the last few lines of God Save the Queen .
The singer touched her hand to her ear before eventually joining in after the crowds , footballers and Prince William had already been singing for around 30 seconds .
Immediately following the performance , she blamed the delay on technical difficulties .
She tweeted : â€œOh My God .
Biggest audience of my life
and I get technical difficulties !
Argh so sorry
Guys!!!â€
�
She later added : â€œMortified ! !
I donâ€
™ t know what happened.â€
�
With millions more people watching around the world , fans and commentators on social media were unforgiving .
Oscar Quaye tweeted : â€œShe had ONE job and flopped ... how embarrassingâ€ � , while Piers Morgan quipped :
â€œDid Louis van Gaal advise that female singer for the anthem ?
â€˜Do nothing for the first halfâ€ ¦ â€
™ â€ �
Others were slightly kinder , with fan
Natasha Henry tweeting : â€œPoor girl.â€ � Meanwhile , BBC presenter Gary Lineker , who was hosting the television coverage , merely said : â€œWell that all went according to planâ€ � .
Prior to her performance at Wembley as Manchester United beat Crystal Palace 2 - 1 to win the famous trophy , the singer described the event as a â€œonce - in - a - lifetime chanceâ€ � , and added nervously : â€œThe main thing is not being able to hear myself ...
thereâ€
™ s going to be so many people singing it back.â€ �
After the mishap , BBC commentator Guy Mowbray defended Harding , saying : â€œThereâ€ ™ s a lot of noise around the place , itâ€ ™ s easy to miss your cue.â€ � Harding , a former Eurovision contestant , had followed the performance of rapper Tinie Tempah .
Tempahâ€ ™ s performance was also criticised .
Fans mocked his outfit and viewers were also unhappy that he seemed to be checking his phone while walking towards the stage .
The pre - match entertainment was also likened to the Super Bowl â€ “ the American Football end - of - season spectacle .
Another commentator on the final , Alan Green , said on BBC Radio 5 Live :
â€œWhoever was responsible for the [ pre - match show ] , an utter shambles , should go away now and lock themselves in a darkened room.â€ �
In 2010 , Harding competed to represent the UK in the Eurovision Song contest , with Your Country Needs You , but was beaten by Josh Dubovie with his song That Sounds Good to Me .
She went on to appear on The X Factor in 2013 , but was replaced during the showâ€ ™ s six - chairs challenge stage by mentor Nicole Scherzinger , with Melanie McCabe taking her seat .
In January 2015 she released her own single , Say Something , which went to No 7 in the UKâ€ ™ s singles chart ."
2016-06-15,"Prince William has become the first member of the royal family to be photographed for the cover of a gay magazine .
The second - in - line to the throne appears in the July issue of Attitude magazine , discussing the mental health implications of homophobic , bi - phobic and transphobic bullyings .
The cover photograph came from a shoot by Leigh Keily taken for the magazine .
His mother , Princess Diana , who was patron of the National Aids Trust , appeared on the cover of the Gay Times in a 1997 tribute issue after her death .
The cover of the Attitude edition , which is available for download now , shows a smiling William , wearing a white open - necked shirt , with the caption : â€œMaking history , Prince William meets Attitude.â€ �
A number of previous cover stars , including the Olympic diver Tom Daley and pop star Harry Judd , of McFly , have appeared topless but the comedian , writer and broadcaster , Stephen Fry , and singer Gary Barlow , appear , like William , fully clothed .
The cover came about after the Duke of Cambridge invited Attitude to bring members of the LGBT+ community to Kensington Palace to hear their experiences of bullying and discuss the impact on mental health .
William , along with the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry , is leading the Heads
Together campaign , which aims to end stigma around mental health .
He told Attitude : â€œNo one should be bullied for their sexuality or any other reason and no one should have to put up with the kind of hate that these young people have endured in their lives .
The young gay , lesbian and transgender individuals I met through Attitude are truly brave to speak out and to give hope to people who are going through terrible bullying right now .
Their sense of strength and optimism should give us all encouragement to stand up to bullying wherever we see
it.â€
�
He urged anyone who was being bullied for their sexuality to contact someone whom they could trust , whether a friend , teacher or other adult , or a service such as Childline or the Diana Award .
â€œYou should be proud of the person you are and you have nothing to be ashamed of , â€ � the prince said .
Matthew Todd , editor of Attitude , said : â€œDuring my time as editor I have met parents whose child has taken or lost their life after being bullied for being LGBT+ or just perceived to be LGBT .
I am very happy that the future king of the UK agrees this must stop.â€
�
The issue of Attitude magazine went to press on 8 June , just days before the killing of 49 people at a gay club in Orlando , in the US .
On Tuesday , William and Kate signed a book of condolences at the American embassy for victims of the massacre .
The magazine said : â€œSuch violence does not exist in a vacuum but snowballs from intolerance and bullying that begins in classrooms , too often comes from politicians or religious leaders , and is often not treated with respect by the media.â€ �
The print edition featuring William will be in shops next Wednesday .
â€¢
This article was amended on 15 June 2016 to correct the fact the Prince William is second - in - line to the throne rather than heir .
It was further amended on 14 July 2016 to remove a section that said research had found that â€œ33.9 % of young LGB people have made at least one suicide attempt , compared with 17.9 % of young straight people , while 48.1 % of trans young people have attempted suicideâ€ � .
These figures came from the PACE charityâ€ ™ s RaRE Research Report which acknowledged that it was possible that there was â€œa disproportion amongst research participants of people with experience of or who are sensitive towards mental health issuesâ€
� .
A 2009 report from the NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care gave a figure of 7.3 % for the proportion of all 16- to 24-year - olds who had made an unsuccessful suicide attempt ."
2016-06-16,"Earlier this week I walked in the rain to Old Compton Street , the Soho heart of Londonâ€ ™ s LGBT scene .
I joined thousands of people â€ “ including mainstream politicians â€ “ at a vigil for those slaughtered and injured in an Orlando club .
A space supposed to be protected from attack .
A space in which LGBT people were supposed to be free to love and live and drink cocktails with stupid names and umbrellas in them .
The walls of Soho were adorned as they always are : club night posters for Gâ€“Aâ€“Y. Billboards for West End shows .
The scribbled love in the underpass next to the old Foyles building ( the sign now reads : O Yes ) .
Soon , the hoardings outside shops will be advertising the new issue of Attitude magazine , Prince William beaming from the cover .
Some people arenâ€ ™ t happy about this .
Isnâ€
™ t it massively hypocritical for Prince William , future head of the Commonwealth â€ “ that archaic construction of nations , many of which still persecute LGBT people â€ “ to be posing on the front of Britainâ€ ™
s
leading gay magazine espousing the wrongs of homophobia , bi- and transphobia ?
Republicans in particular werenâ€ ™ t happy about it .
Ryan John Butcher , the deputy editor of rival publication , Gay Times , dismissed the Attitude interview as â€œgreat PRâ€ � and wrote that : â€œThe royal family is an abhorrent relic of the past.â€
�
The idea that a republican can not enjoy some aspects of the royals is very black and white .
I think the amount of money spent on the monarchy is bordering on immoral and would be better spent elsewhere .
But do I enjoy the Queenâ€ ™ s ( or her stylistâ€ ™ s ) knack for picking the perfect fuchsia skirt suit ?
Of course .
I love her fuchsia suits .
Did I balk at the sycophancy of Fearne Cotton during that period when she seemed to spend her entire time interviewing young royals in faux - casual set - ups on a couch ?
Yes .
But did I warm to them ?
Yes .
( And Cotton was just doing her job ) .
I hate that Prince Charles writes spidery letters of duress to parliament .
But I love Kensington gardens .
I donâ€
™ t think any of this makes me a hypocrite .
I think it makes me an adult who knows that life isnâ€ ™ t binary .
The point about the Commonwealth is on firmer ground .
Put simply : the way some Commonwealth nations treat LGBT people is abominable .
Same - sex relations can be illegal and punishable .
But it is staggering how often people neglect the fact that a lot of these homophobic laws and attitudes were outsourced to Commonwealth countries by â€ ¦ the British empire .
Because the Commonwealth is just the fag - end of British colonialism .
Having the future leader of the Commonwealth speak out against anti - LGBT practices , the kind that have reduced me to tears on occasion , can only be a good thing .
Same as when Britainâ€ ™ s prime minister does .
The final criticism of William is that he is preaching to the converted .
Heâ€ ™ s speaking out against homophobic bullying , but in a gay magazine , which probably doesnâ€ ™ t have many homophobic readers .
But people notice magazine covers , they have an impact .
Of course non - LGBT people will spot the billboards and the magazines in shops .
Just as seeing screaming anti - migrant headlines in the Mail or mental health epithets on the front page of the Sun become a risk when popping to the newsagent .
On top of this , every media outlet is publishing stories on Williamâ€ ™ s Attitude cover .
His name trended on Twitter .
His reach is huge and global .
The monarchy is especially popular with those one wouldnâ€ ™ t automatically associate with a progressive outlook on sexuality and gender : older people ; people in conservative countries ; small - c conservatives themselves .
Most of our aunts .
Itâ€ ™ s ironic that some members of the LGBT community accuse William of preaching to the converted , when we too often engage in inward - looking online feedback loops .
The straight , white , male , prince is far more likely to get through to people whose attitudes towards LGBT people leave something to be desired , than gay people with placards .
It also helps when people we wouldnâ€ ™ t expect to decide to speak out on behalf of our community â€ “ even changing their minds â€ “ such as Republican governor , Spencer Cox , who made a hugely emotional speech this week doing just that .
We must ask ourselves : if Prince William had been caught using a homophobic slur or speaking against the rights of LGBT people , how would we react ?
The same people who are now saying his comments in Attitude make no difference , as he has no influence , and is part of the problem , would no doubt be saying that he is a role model , and has the ears of the world and how dangerous his comments were .
Butcher , along with others , said that he doubted the princeâ€ ™
s cover would do any â€œtangible
goodâ€ � .
But look at the good his mother , Diana , Princess of Wales , did for the LGBT community .
In a time when some wouldnâ€ ™ t even touch people who were HIV positive , Diana was photographed hugging them , speaking out against ignorance , lending her time and patronage to LGBT charities .
Thereâ€ ™ s no doubt this influenced public opinion .
But things , including the monarchy , do not change overnight .
Finally , I donâ€
™ t know how anybody can quibble with Williamâ€ ™ s statement : â€œNo one should be bullied for their sexuality or any other reason .
No one should have to put up with the kind of hate that these young people have endured in their lives.â€ � Iâ€ ™ m even less clear how LGBT people who have felt this hate can .
I wish we didnâ€ ™ t need LGBT rights on the covers of magazines .
I wish celebrities parading their non - prejudice wasnâ€ ™ t a thing .
But prejudice and erasure and dismissal of LGBT people happens all the time .
Whether itâ€ ™ s terror attacks or smaller acts of aggression â€ “ such as the time a central London cabbie told me to get out and walk to the gay club I was travelling to .
Or a hesitation to hold hands with someone of the same sex , let alone kiss .
As my colleague David Shariatmadari pointed out , sexuality is a â€œconfounding landscape of feelings , sensations and thoughts : excitement , confusion , comfort , longing , disappointment , fear , rejectionâ€ � .
People in the LGBT community arenâ€ ™ t all proud and happy and confident and marching .
Cut them open and we donâ€ ™ t
all bleed glitter .
Not all of us are comfortable at a KD Lang gig .
Some of us do feel uncertainty or shame or ambivalence , often internalised because of external othering and societal conditioning .
Anything that goes some way towards us not needing Prince William on the cover of a magazine in a hope to change attitudes â€ “ and perversely , that includes Prince William on the cover of Attitude magazine â€ “ is OK with me ."

2016-06-19,"Less than two weeks ago , the new issue of Attitude went to press .
It would be its editorâ€ ™ s last edition â€ “ Matthew Todd , who has worked for the gay magazine since 1996 , told his staff in January he felt it was time to move on .
And his final issue would be a joyous , thunderous one that would get attention around the world ; its cover star would be Prince William , the first time a royal would appear on the front of a gay magazine .
In it , he would say â€œno one should be bullied for their sexualityâ€ � , and recognition of homophobic bullying by such a famous figure would , hoped Todd , put the issue firmly into the spotlight .
Four days later , a man shot 49 people dead at a LGBT bar in Florida , and wounded many more .
Toddâ€ ™ s face seems to drain of colour at the mention of it .
We sit in the offices of Attitude â€
“
it has a small circulation but it punches well above its weight in terms of influence â€ “ where Todd has been editor since 2008 .
It wasnâ€ ™ t just the atrocity that distressed him , but the way parts of the media covered it .
Or rather , didnâ€ ™ t .
He says he found it â€œshockingâ€ � that the Daily Mail didnâ€ ™ t put the massacre â€ “ the worst terrorist attack in the US since 9/11 , and its worst mass shooting â€ “ on its front page .
â€œIt perpetuates this message to young people â€ “ that your life is not as important as other peopleâ€ ™ s , â€ � he says .
The reluctance of some people to label the attack homophobic was dismaying .
Todd watched the Sky News paper review , where Guardian columnist Owen Jones walked out after the host and a fellow guest appeared to downplay the killerâ€ ™ s homophobic motivation for the attack .
â€œI was screaming at the TV , I was so annoyed , â€ � says Todd . â€œTo not say what it was , which was homophobic .
I wonder whether there are some people in the media who are so uncomfortable about acknowledging the damaging effect of homophobia because so much of the media has perpetuated it , and sometimes still does.â€
�
This was the thinking behind getting Prince William , who he first approached in 2011 , to support Attitudeâ€ ™ s ongoing campaign against homophobic bullying â€
“ that it would get attention and make others more likely to take it seriously .
â€œFor him to say â€˜this is important , and itâ€ ™ s something I care aboutâ€ ™ is huge .
It frustrates me that the mainstream doesnâ€ ™ t talk about it , â€ � says Todd .
There are lots of reasons , he says â€ “ a lack of understanding , few LGBT people in powerful positions in the media , but also a reluctance within the gay community to talk about it .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve noticed in my career at Attitude , â€ � says Todd , â€œthat talking about bullying and experiences at school was so painful that people didnâ€ ™ t feel comfortable doing it.â€
�
Todd has written a book , Straight Jacket , in which he documents his own childhood experiences , and the long - term mental health and addiction issues he has suffered ; he is also using it to call for a government inquiry into the experiences of LGBT children at school .
A recovering alcoholic who had stopped drinking in 2009 , as soon as he started writing the book he began drinking again ( he has since stopped ) .
Growing up in south London , Todd became aware he was gay when he was
about 11 â€ “
it was the mid-80s , Section 28 was just around the corner , and it was a frightening time to have such a realisation .
â€œThe media was portraying gay people as perverts and paedophiles and you were going to die of Aids .
My parents were fantastic but they didnâ€
™ t understand .
I heard negativity at home , and homophobia everywhere.â€ �
There was this idea in the tabloids that gay people were predatory adults , â€œtrying to recruit young people .
There was no acknowledgment we had been kids .
I remember being absolutely terrified about feeling different .
I didnâ€ ™ t want to be gay , I cried myself to sleep night after night , I thought about suicide.â€ �
Had he not come out at 16 , he says , he would probably have ended his life .
â€œI was heading for collapse.â€ �
Not that coming out solved everything .
For the next 20 years â€ “ even while projecting an image of stability â€ “
Toddâ€ ™ s mental health suffered , and for years he was abusing alcohol , turning up to shoots drunk , having to make excuses and go home .
He went into recovery and a therapist told him , â€œIâ€ ™ m not surprised youâ€ ™ re fucked up , youâ€ ™ re gayâ€ � .
â€œIt was a very confrontational thing to say , but then he went on to explain that the problem was not that I was gay , but that Iâ€ ™
d had the experience of growing up in a society that invalidates you at every turn .
That was like a lightbulb going
on.â€
�
He wrote about it in the magazine , attracting its biggest ever response from readers .
Todd stresses there are â€œlots and lotsâ€ � of very happy , confident gay people
â€ “ and recent strides in equality have made a huge difference to the lives of LGBT people
â€ “
â€œbut it does seem like there are a disproportionate number of people who are still struggling.â€
�
His own recovery is ongoing , he says , and it feels right to leave the magazine after 20 years .
After he told his team , â€œI suddenly went into a little bit of a panic .
This is an amazing magazine , an amazing job and Iâ€ ™ ve had the most incredible experiences .
But I want to do other things.â€ �
He wrote a play , which was performed in London and Australia in 2005 , and heâ€ ™ d like to revisit that , among other projects .
Todd will remain at Attitude as editorial director on a part - time basis to steer the magazine , and he says he is excited to see where it heads under a new editor .
He is buoyed by the younger generation of LGBT people â€œwho perhaps , unlike some in the older generation , arenâ€ ™ t going to accept a certain amount of advancement , and think they deserve equality .
Iâ€ ™ ve felt over the last few years there has been a repoliticisation.â€ �
He feels proud to have played a part in that .
â€œAttitude was started in 1994 as an expression of the new confidence and empowerment that was coming after the 80s .
As a young man I was really excited about that .
I think itâ€ ™ s evolved and I hope Iâ€ ™ ve made the magazine a little bit more policitised.â€ �
Under his editorship , Tony Blair , David Cameron and Ed Miliband have all appeared on the cover â€ “ not , mercifully
, shirtless in the magazineâ€ ™ s typical oiled - six pack cover - star style .
â€œIn the past year weâ€ ™ ve been moving away from them , â€ � says Todd , with a smile .
He has had letters and emails from young people who say the magazine has given them confidence , including the courage to come out .
Recently , a young man told him heâ€ ™ d only learned about HIV through the magazine .
Todd shakes his head in exasperation .
â€œI mean , itâ€ ™ s amazing , â€ � he says .
â€œBut itâ€ ™ s appalling that thatâ€ ™ s the situation .
The government wonâ€ ™ t bring in mandatory sex and relationship education
and I think they are responsible for young people not being educated about HIV , who go out and catch HIV .
Itâ€ ™ s really shocking.â€
�
Clearly recent events and their aftermath â€ “ from the missteps by the media to the sickening homophobic tweets
â€ “ prove there is a huge way to go .
â€œItâ€
™ s distressing .
Frightening , â€ � says Todd . â€œI noticed people at the vigil [ in London for the victims of the Orlando shooting ] were chanting â€˜weâ€
™ re here , weâ€ ™ re queer , we will not live in fearâ€ ™ which I thought was really powerful .
Despite these terrible , terrible things , the overall movement is positive and weâ€ ™ re moving forward.â€ � Curriculum vitae Age : 42 Education :

2016-07-20,"Margaret Thatcher was privately warned by foreign secretary Francis Pym in 1983 that the anti - nuclear movement could become so â€œwidespread and powerfulâ€ � that it might halt the deployment of US cruise missiles in Britain .
Newly released Downing Street files also show that Thatcherâ€ ™ s press secretary , Bernard Ingham , recommended the release of official footage of royal baby Prince William over the 1983 Easter bank holiday weekend , in order to knock Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament protests out of the news headlines .
Ingham recommended using footage of the prince with his parents , Charles and Diana , to bury coverage of the anti - nuclear protests after admitting that alternatives such as an â€œassassination attempt on the Popeâ€ � or a â€œNorth Sea blow outâ€ � were in the â€œlap of the godsâ€ � .
The latest batch of files released by the National Archives in Kew show that concern over the deployment of US nuclear cruise missiles in Britain went far beyond the ranks of CND and the Greenham Common women to include at least one of Thatcherâ€ ™ s closest advisers .
Sir Anthony Parsons , a former ambassador who advised Thatcher after his retirement , told her that he was â€œastonishedâ€ � at the â€œwide spectrum of personal friendsâ€ � who were â€œactual or potential supporters of the governmentâ€ � and were preoccupied with the nuclear debate .
He said one reason for their concern was the presence in the White House of Ronald Reagan , a president â€œof lower intellectual calibre and less grasp of international issues than any incumbent since the second world warâ€ � .
The Downing Street files also include a later MI5 report on a claim by John Major , Thatcherâ€ ™ s successor at No 10 , that CND was trying to buy up properties on the edge of one of the bases where the cruise missiles had been deployed .
But Pymâ€ ™ s official assessment of the impact of the anti - nuclear movement in the 1980s shows that the mass protests came closer to halting the deployment of US missiles than many assumed at the time .
In a â€œpersonal and confidentialâ€ � note in January 1983 , Pym told Thatcher that it would prove a crucial year in the nuclear weapons debate , with 144 US cruise missiles to be deployed in November at bases at Greenham Common , Berkshire , and Molesworth , Cambridgeshire .
Pym warned that an â€œenergetic and outright attack on the peace movementâ€ � , which had been attracting hundreds of thousands of people to its demonstrations , might â€œhearten the faithful , but it does little to persuade the doubtersâ€ � .
He said that thousands of people were entering active politics for the first time through the peace movement .
Pym wrote : â€œThe risk is two - fold : a. the development of a mass movement of demonstrations and civil disobedience against Cruise in 1983 so widespread and powerful that deployment would actually become difficult or even impossible .
I still would not rate this possibility very highly , but it is less inconceivable than it was six months ago .
â€œb .
an intensification of public opinion against nuclear weapons so strong that large numbers determine their vote on this issue in favour of the Labour or Liberal parties at the general election.â€ � Pym urged Thatcher to launch a sustained publicity campaign .
She agreed and asked her new defence secretary , Michael Heseltine , to undertake the role .
But she rejected one Pym suggestion that she chair a roundtable conference of senior members of the clergy including the archbishops , the cardinal and the moderator .
â€œFatal
â€ “ I would have thought , â€ �
she noted in response to the idea .
However , Heseltine took to his task with gusto .
He made plans to be filmed at the Berlin Wall over the 1983 Easter bank holiday weekend , when CND was planning a 14-mile ( 23 km ) human chain linking the nuclear warhead factories at Aldermaston and Burghfield to Greenham Common .
Ingham was not overjoyed by Heseltineâ€ ™ s plan , saying he had â€œserious doubts about ministers being seen to be competing with CND on Good Friday , the day of Christâ€ ™ s crucifixionâ€ � .
The press secretary said they needed to consider â€œwhether there was anything useful we can do to neutralise the television appeal of these demonstrations .
They will secure less airtime and have less impact if something more newsworthy in television terms occurs â€ “ eg ( to be brutal ) a North Sea blow out ; an assassination attempt on the Pope , etc ;
some awful tragedy.â€ �
On 17 March 1983 , Ingham told a Downing Street meeting : â€œI think that Good Friday is a lost cause .
This is the day when the CND chain will ( or will not ) be formed between Aldermaston and Greenham Common .
It is also a day when there is not much sport .
However , what would take the trick would be press and TV pictures , for the release on the evening of Good Friday and/or Saturday newspapers of Prince William in Australia.â€
�
His proposal was recorded in the minutes as an official recommendation .
But although the media did report that 70,000 people took part in CNDâ€ ™ s â€œhuman chainâ€ � protest , no pictures of Prince William on tour in Australia with his parents seem to have appeared that Easter weekend ."
2016-07-21,"The release of historic documents to the National Archives often provides revelatory stories , and the latest batch covering the 1986 - 88 period are no exception .
Now we know about Denis Thatcher writing to the BBCâ€ ™ s chairman , Marmaduke Hussey , to complain about an item on Radio 4â€ ™ s Today programme having â€œfoully defamedâ€ � his wife , the then prime minister .
We discovered that Margaret Thatcherâ€ ™ s chief press secretary , Bernard Ingham , came up with a wheeze to keep nuclear disarmament protestors at Greenham Common off the front pages by suggesting the release of pictures of the infant Prince William .
( It didnâ€ ™ t work , according to the Daily Telegraph ) .
And the government considered carrying out blood tests on foreign visitors to screen them for Aids as they entered the country , an idea quashed because â€œexperts warned ... there would be little public health benefit.â€ �
But there is a lot of information from the period that we can not know about because , as the Guardianâ€ ™ s Owen Bowcott reports , â€œlarge numbers of files have been withheld from the latest releases.â€
�
They include royal and security files ; the proceedings of the Profumo inquiry ; the Peter Wright â€œSpycatcherâ€ � case ; most defence records ; Anglo - Irish negotiations ; and documents about the business dealings of Thatcherâ€ ™ s son , Mark .
Why ?
Bowcott speculates that the transition from a 30-year to a 20-year release rule introduced by Gordon Brown may be â€œencouraging the normally retired civil servants who â€˜weedâ€ ™ the files , taking out material still deemed to be excessively sensitive , to adopt a more cautious approach.â€
�
Some of the decisions are very odd .
For example , what can be the reason for withholding 45 transcripts of evidence to Lord Denningâ€ ™ s 1963 inquiry into the Profumo affair for 84 years ?
None of the leading characters involved are living .
Indeed , almost everyone connected to the case is no longer with us .
Itâ€ ™ s a disgrace to keep the files secret .
I also agree with the Daily Mirror , which is particularly exercised by the files on Mark Thatcher remaining secret .
Two of them - â€œCementation contract : Mark Thatcher and the Omanisâ€ � - will be â€œretainedâ€ � until 2053 .
Two others - â€œMark Thatcher and the Omanis ; other allegations against Mark Thatcherâ€ � and â€œRequest by Electronic Data Systems to employ
Mark Thatcherâ€ � - have been â€œtemporarily retainedâ€ � with no date for their release .
According to the Mirror , the decision to keep the files closed â€œwas ultimately taken by former culture secretary John Whittingdaleâ€ � , one - time political secretary to Thatcher .
It moved the Mirror to comment that â€œthe Tory establishment is guilty of looking after its own by hiding details of Mark Thatcherâ€ ™ s controversial business dealings on mum Margaretâ€ ™ s coat - tails when she was
Prime Minister.â€ �
The paper argues that â€œthe public has an absolute right to know what happened , however embarrassing the facts may prove to be for some people still alive and the deceased ex - PMâ€ ™ s reputation.â€
�
It continues :
â€œMark Thatcherâ€ ™ s
personal enrichment from his dealings with the Omanis in the Middle East was a cause of great concern in the 1980s and what has emerged since is not pretty .
Delaying the release until long after his death is indefensible .
We say publish immediately and let the court of public opinion pass its verdict.â€ �
And who , apart from the man himself and his friends , can disagree with that ?"
2016-07-26,"William Waldegrave , provost of Eton college , is probably the poshest person I have met .
That is not because he is Lord Waldegrave , which is just a common - or - garden life peerage awarded after he served 16 years as a Tory minister , but because his father was the 12th Earl Waldegrave and his elder brother is the 13th Earl .
His sister Susan is lady - in - waiting to the Queen and godmother to Prince William ; his brother was a page at the coronation .
The earldom goes back to the early 18th century but the Waldegraves were big cheeses long before that : one was Speaker of the House of Commons during Richard IIâ€ ™ s reign and another got a knighthood from Mary I plus the Chewton estate in Somerset , where William was brought up and still farms .
When he went to boarding school , the train was pulled by a steam locomotive named Earl Waldegrave .
Waldegraveâ€ ™ s relationship with Eton has deep roots .
He went there , as did his father , brother and son .
His maternal grandfather played cricket for the Eton XI against Harrow at Lordâ€ ™ s in 1892 and another ancestor drowned in the college grounds .
It may seem unsurprising , then , that Waldegrave landed himself in controversy this summer over government attempts to increase social mobility .
Matt Hancock , the then Cabinet Office minister , said he would order the civil service to ask applicants about their home backgrounds and schooling , and encourage other big employers to do the same .
Children , Waldegrave protested , should not be punished for their parentsâ€ ™ decisions nor jobs filled by social engineering rather than merit .
If there was more of this nonsense , he would resign from the Conservative party .
To anyone who knows Waldegrave , the threat came as a shock .
He is not , for one thing , a very passionate person , admitting in his memoirs , published last year , that he didnâ€ ™ t go into politics to advance some great cause but to deal with â€œthe problems one found through the application of as much intelligence as one could musterâ€ � .
When Kenneth Clarke upset doctors and nurses with changes to the NHS , Margaret Thatcher replaced him with Waldegrave because â€œKenneth has stirred them all up and I want you to calm them all down.â€ �
And though he faithfully served Thatcher , he was always regarded as a â€œwetâ€ � , firmly on the partyâ€ ™ s left .
His first allegiance was to Edward Heath , for whom he worked as private secretary .
He was against immigration controls , hanging and laws restricting homosexuality .
He was never comfortable with the modern Toriesâ€ ™ dedication to free enterprise and hostility to state institutions â€ “ â€œprivate good , public bad just is not trueâ€
� , he wrote in 2012 â€ “ and laments that â€œin the society we have created â€ ¦
no slogan exists to shame the rich into any semblance of solidarity with the poor.â€ �
So why did he criticise Hancock so vehemently ?
â€œBecause what he plans would lead to new kinds of unfairness .
At Eton , I raise money for bursaries for children whose families canâ€ ™ t afford the fees .
If these children are going to be discriminated against by my own partyâ€ ™ s government , I raise the alarm .
Oxford says 25 % of its entrants from lower socio - economic backgrounds come from independent schools on bursaries .
We had a boy from a very impoverished London East End background and heâ€ ™ s now at the grandest of Oxford colleges .
His CV would look awful to Hancock because it says Eton and Christ Church and everyone would say he must be in the Bullingdon Club .
Well , I can tell you he jolly well
isnâ€ ™ t.â€
�
I point out that Hancock later explained that any information on home and school background would be collected anonymously and â€œnot form the basis of any individual recruitment decisionâ€ � .
Hancock wanted top employers to reform their selection procedures , eliminating unconscious biases so that their workforces are drawn from more diverse backgrounds .
They can not do that successfully without measuring the effects .
â€œThat puts him in a much better place , â€ � Waldegrave says .
â€œHowever , with the best intentions in the world , if you collect this kind of information , you are on a continuum towards targets and then quotas .
Thereâ€ ™ s a gap between intention and outcome in these things.â€ �
He quotes Goodhartâ€ ™ s Law , formulated by another Old Etonian , an economist called Charles Goodhart : â€œWhen a measure becomes a target it ceases to be a good measure.â€ �
But progress towards equality of opportunity is painfully slow .
Most top positions in Britain are still held by people from fee - charging schools .
Hancock says the civil service fast stream is less socially diverse than Oxbridge .
Arenâ€ ™ t targets , even quotas , needed to achieve real change ?
â€œReal change is slow .
Short cuts end up in worse things .
Look at gender : slowly , slowly , weâ€ ™ re getting there .
If it had been done by quotas , the change might not have been so profound .
You donâ€ ™
t change whatâ€ ™ s on the inside .
People just tick boxes .
We have to be patient .
â€œThe civil service should be going out to schools and saying we want you to join us , not because we have quotas to fill but because we want to make the civil service better .
Universities should be doing the same .
At Eton , we have appointed a full - time director of outreach to find not just gifted and talented children
â€ “
we donâ€ ™ t want to be creaming off
as the grammar schools did â€ “ but also those in boarding need.â€ �
We are talking at the London headquarters of Coutts , Britainâ€ ™ s third oldest bank ( founded 1692 ) , where Waldegrave is non - executive chairman .
This occupies two days a week while Eton , for which he gets nearly Â£100,000 a year plus an on - site apartment next door to the head , occupies five , he tells me .
So he works seven days a week ?
â€œI
do actually .
The provost doesnâ€ ™ t just chair
governorsâ€ ™ meetings .
Thereâ€ ™ s fundraising , a museum , endowments , relations with local schools .
Iâ€ ™ m always there at weekends during term.â€ �
He says he always wanted a sinecure but hasnâ€ ™ t found one yet .
Thatâ€ ™ s a joke .
From his schooldays , he wanted to reach the very top and had a detailed plan for getting there .
He became president of the Oxford Union , got a first , did a spell at Harvard , became a fellow of All Souls and worked for GEC , then Britainâ€ ™ s largest company .
He was elected to parliament in 1979 , aged 32 , and got on the ministerial ladder within two years , responsible for higher education .
He imposed university cuts but temporarily stopped polytechnics ( as they then were ) being removed from local authority control .
In the same spirit , he is â€œsuspiciousâ€ � of academies and thinks that , in about 10 years , â€œpeople will say they should be accountable to elected people and local education authorities will be reinventedâ€ � .
He is also suspicious of the national curriculum .
â€œBasic tests of literacy and numeracy , maybe .
But the danger is you diminish pluralism .
If a good head has a couple of teachers who can really run with drama , why shouldnâ€ ™ t he let them?â€
�
He stayed at the education department until 1983 and , by then , was already doubting he could reach No 10 .
Having seen Thatcher in action over the Falklands , he didnâ€ ™ t think he could match her single - minded determination .
He held junior ministerial positions at the environment department before moving to the Foreign Office and reaching the cabinet as health secretary just before Thatcherâ€ ™ s fall in 1990 .
He thought he could make it to foreign secretary .
Alas , during his FCO spell , he was involved in a row over government guidelines on arms sales to Iraq , then officially subject to a boycott , which Matrix Churchill , a Coventry company , allegedly breached , leading to its directors facing jail .
An inquiry later found that Waldegrave wrote â€œdesignedly misleadingâ€ � letters about the guidelines but with â€œno intent to deceiveâ€ � .
This was supposed to mean he hadnâ€ ™ t lied , but the damage was done and his career , and to some extent his self - esteem , was ruined .
Waldegrave tells this story with wry self - deprecation in his memoir , A Different Kind of Weather ( 2015 ) , not being fool enough to think anybody will or should shed tears .
He has worked in financial services since he lost his Bristol West seat in 1997 , so he is probably better off financially as a result .
And since his biggest ministerial achievement was the poll tax â€ “ which he designed while an environment minister â€ “ some may say his disgrace was deserved even if it came about for the wrong reasons .
One should keep a soft spot for Waldegraveâ€ ™ s almost extinct form of Toryism : gentler , more inclusive and more respectful of established institutions than its post-1970s successor .
But I come away thinking that he tries too much to have his cake and eat it .
His father , a Tory minister from 1958 to 1962 , believed , Waldegrave says , in â€œa sort of hierarchical Christian socialismâ€ � ( surely an oxymoron ) and says there is something of that in him .
Even more surprisingly , he suddenly refers to â€œyour famous
ideaâ€ �
â€ “ my suggestion in Education Guardian in 2012 that elite universities such as Oxford and Cambridge
should take the two best students from every school in the country , whether it is Eton or a â€œsink
comprehensiveâ€ �
â€ “ and describes it as â€œnot a bad ideaâ€ � .
I am , of course , flattered .
But this must be aristocratic charm and courtesy at work .
Eton would be happy with sending just two pupils a year to Oxbridge ?
I donâ€
™ t think so .

2016-09-16,"Jonathan Douglas - Hughes , the vice - lord lieutenant of Essex , has said he hurt nothing but his pride after suffering a slight fall while accompanying the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on a visit to a school in Harlow .
Burdened by his ceremonial sword , or possibly the spurs on his polished boots , Douglas - Hughes , 72 , appeared to stumble backwards over a concrete bollard outside Stewards Academy , where the royal couple were promoting a childrenâ€ ™ s mental health campaign .
Douglas - Hughes was helped to his feet by Prince William and others , who rushed to his aid .
â€œIâ€ ™ m fine , thank you , â€ � he said later .
â€œThe Duke was very concerned , but I reassured him
I was perfectly all right.â€

2016-09-22,"Prince William says he fears the African elephant will have disappeared from the wild due to poaching by the time Princess Charlotte turns 25 .
The prince told the audience of campaigners and policymakers at Time
For Change â€ “ an event organised by the conservation charity Tusk , of which he is a patron â€ “ that he was â€œnot prepared to be part of a generation that lets these iconic species disappear from the wildâ€ � .
In a sometimes passionate speech ahead of a global meeting on wildlife protection , he said personal greed was at the root of a crisis that threatened to impoverish everyone .
He said : â€œWhen I was born , there were one million elephants roaming Africa .
â€œBy the time my daughter Charlotte was born last year , the numbers of savannah elephants had crashed to just 350,000 .
â€œAnd at the current pace of illegal poaching , when Charlotte turns 25 the African elephant will be gone from the wild.â€ � William has made wildlife crime and conservation a personal cause and has lobbied the presidents of China , the US and African countries to strengthen protection .
The Duke warned that rhinos face extinction in â€œour lifetimesâ€ � during the speech given at 800 ft ( 244 metres ) above London at The View from The Shard on Thursday .
He said it was now time to send an â€œunambiguous messageâ€ � that it is no longer acceptable to buy or sell ivory or rhino horn .
â€œWe have the chance to say that ivory is a symbol of destruction , not of luxury , and not something that anyone needs to buy or sell .
â€œWe have the chance to say that rhino horn does not cure anything and does not need a legal market.â€
�
William was speaking ahead of a major global conference in Johannesburg this weekend , of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( Cites ) .
He added : â€œMaterialistic greed can not be allowed to win against our moral duty to protect threatened species and vulnerable communities.â€ �
Governments will be asked to increase protection for elephants , lions , monkeys and nearly 500 other species at the two - week meeting .
One of the most contentious issues will be the international trade in elephant ivory .
This is strictly forbidden , but Namibia and Zimbabwe want the ban lifted so they can sell stockpiles and fund community elephant conservation initiatives .
The move contradicts proposals put forward by a coalition of 29 other African countries that want a complete end to the ivory trade .
Britain this week said it planned to close a loophole which allows antique dealers to sell ivory items without rigorous checks on its provenance , but high profile MPs , conservationists and scientists wrote to Theresa May to say a total ban is needed .
Sales of ivory which can not be proven to be over 70 years old will be banned .
Broadcaster and campaigner Hugh Fearnley - Whittingstall , whose TV series on wildlife crime will be aired next month , called for an immediate ban on all ivory sales .
â€œIt is entirely possible that the elephant and the rhino could be made extinct in the wild .
It is time critical .
Every day four rhinos are shot dead by poachers and 80 elephants are hacked down and traded , â€ � he said , speaking at the Shard .
â€œIt boils down to a simple choice .
We must decide whether to keep allowing the legal trade of rhino and elephant ivory , or eradicate it .
I have taken sides in this debate .
The legal trade stimulates the market and provides cover for poached ivory .
The illegal wildlife trade is now at $ 20bn a year , exceeded only the trade in drugs , arms and people , â€ �
he said ."

2016-09-25,"An unlikely alliance of the Queen , Prince William , the Labour MP Frank Field , Commonwealth countries and Canadian ecologists join forces today to protect one of the largest coastal temperate rainforests in the world : the Great Bear rainforest along the central and west coast of British Columbia .
Prince William is in the Canadian province for a weeklong visit and will announce on Monday that the forest will join an international network of forests designed to involve all 53 countries in the Commonwealth .
The network of forests is part of the Queenâ€ ™ s Commonwealth Canopy ( QCC ) , a forest conservation initiative launched in the monarchâ€ ™ s name at the Malta Commonwealth summit last year .
Field said : â€œThe aim is to form a network and collective voice that rivals the Amazonian rainforest in size , and makes a permanent contribution to fight against climate change .
The existence of many Commonwealth nations is directly imperilled by climate change , and this is now a subject that is at the heart of the Commonwealthâ€ ™ s purpose.â€ � Field , better known for his campaigning work in the field of welfare , launched the Cool Earth charity in 2007 with the businessman Johan Eliasch , with the aim of providing local people with an alternative to quick cash from loggers .
The charity has worked with indigenous communities in Peru , Ecuador and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to put local people back in control of the forest .
Since the Commonwealth was created in 1949 , nearly half of its forest has been lost , about a quarter depleted and the remainder has been at great risk .
The Commonwealth forest still represents as much as 20 % of the worldâ€ ™ s total .
The aim of the network , apart from accrediting sustainable forestry schemes within the Commonwealth , is to combine knowledge on how best to preserve the forests .
It may also give the Commonwealth greater relevance as it searches for an expanded role in the context of Brexit .
Ministers are desperate to show energy in international forums in an effort to show that the referendum result does not signal isolation for Britain .
The Great Bear rainforest is regarded as a globally significant area covering 6.4 m hectares along the central and north coast of British Columbia , stretching from Vancouver to Alaska .
It is home to a quarter of the earthâ€ ™ s temperate rainforest .
Increasingly threatened by industrial logging , the government of British Columbia passed historic legislation this year to protect the rainforestâ€ ™ s ecology and indigenous people .
About 85 % of the land will be permanently protected from logging , and British Columbia claims the logging will only be carried out under the strictest rules .
Michael Lake , the director of the Royal Commonwealth Society , said : â€œThe ecosystem - based management regime for British Columbiaâ€ ™ s Great Bear rainforest , developed in collaboration with First Nations , industry and environmental organisations , provides an example that other Commonwealth countries can look to when pursuing their own forest conservation agendas.â€ �
Canadaâ€ ™ s commitment to the Canopy joins those previously received by Antigua and Barbuda , Australia , Belize , Jamaica , Malta , Mauritius , New Zealand , Papua New Guinea , Seychelles , Singapore , Sri Lanka , the United Kingdom and Zambia .
Parcels of private land are scattered throughout the Great Bear rainforest , but are going to opt to be protected as part of the plan .
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are due on Monday to visit Bella Bella on British Columbiaâ€ ™ s remote central coast and fly over the Great Bear rainforest .
It is generally accepted that efforts to save the Amazonian forests had been making some progress until recently .
However , Brazilâ€ ™ s Mato Grosso and Para states are now seen as centres of illegal deforestation .
Data released last month suggested deforestation in Brazil has reached its highest level since 2009 ."
2016-09-26,"One of British Columbiaâ€ ™ s most influential First Nations chiefs has turned down an invitation to participate in a reconciliation ceremony with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their visit to Canada , describing the symbolic ceremony as a â€œpublic charadeâ€ � that papers over the Canadian governmentâ€ ™ s failure to keep its promises to indigenous peoples .
The Black Rod ceremony is slated to take place on Monday evening , in a private sitting room at the stately Government House in Victoria .
Officials have spent more than a year carefully crafting every moment of the ceremony , which will see Prince William add a carved silver ring to the Black Rod , a ceremonial staff created in 2012 to commemorate the Queenâ€ ™ s diamond jubilee .
The staff is currently adorned with three rings , representing the province , Canada and the link to the UK .
Prince William is expected to add a fourth ring â€ “ engraved with eagle feathers and a canoe â€ “ that will symbolise First Nations in the province .
â€œReconciliation has to be more than empty symbolic gestures , â€ � said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs in explaining his decision to decline the royal invitation .
He had been asked to hand the ring to Prince William and invite the royal to affix the ring on the Black Rod .
Last week he and the chiefs of the 115 First Nations represented by his organisation decided it would not be appropriate to attend or participate in the event .
â€œThe Chiefs - in - Assembly just didnâ€ ™ t feel that it was appropriate to feed into that public illusion that everything is okay.â€ �
When the Liberals , led by Justin Trudeau , swept into government nearly a year ago , there was a sense of great hope within the indigenous community , Phillip said .
Amid crushing levels of indigenous poverty , sky - high suicide rates and thousands of missing and murdered indigenous women , Trudeau had campaigned on a renewed relationship with Canadaâ€ ™ s indigenous peoples .
He vowed to repeal legislation that failed to respect aboriginal and treaty rights , committed to closing the wide gap in education funding for indigenous Canadians and pledged to address the lack of clean water and dilapidated , overcrowded housing that plagues many First Nations across Canada , among other promises .
â€œYet that hasnâ€ ™ t happened , â€ � said Phillip .
Instead , the Liberal government has repeatedly ignored a ruling by the Canadian human rights tribunal that found the government was racially discriminating against aboriginal youth by underfunding the welfare system .
Its first budget â€ “ billed by the government as making â€œhistoric investmentsâ€ � in indigenous communities â€ “ will not deliver the bulk of the funding until after 2019 .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re sick and tired of the lofty , eloquent rhetoric on the part of Prime Minister Trudeau , â€ � said Phillip .
A similar situation has played out at the provincial level .
â€œThe British Columbia government has proven to be absolutely adversarial to the rights and interests of First Nation people in the province , â€ � said Phillip , pointing to the provinceâ€ ™ s efforts to fast - track the Site C hydroelectric dam , a C$ 9bn ( US $ 7bn ) project that will see an area roughly equivalent to about 5,000 rugby fields flooded in north - east British Columbia .
A campaign launched globally by Amnesty International last month calls on the federal and British Columbian governments to withdraw all permits and approvals for Site C , over concerns that the mega - project tramples on the rights of indigenous peoples in northeast British Columbia .
Philip said the hypocrisy of taking part in a reconciliation ceremony was laid bare last week as the organisationâ€ ™ s chiefs gathered for their annual general meeting .
â€œThere were tears and gut - wrenching first - hand accounts of the tragedies in our communities .
At same time weâ€ ™ re asked to participate in a reconciliation ceremony that for all intents and purposes would suggest there is a very harmonious and robust relationship between the First Nation people and provincial and federal governments , â€ � he said .
â€œAnd thatâ€ ™ s an illusion .
We decided that for us it wasnâ€ ™ t appropriate to participate in such a public charade.â€ �
He wasnâ€ ™ t sure if other aboriginal leaders would participate in the event and stressed that the decision was not meant to disrespect anyone .
â€œI apologise for any inconvenience we may have caused with our decision.â€ �
The duke and duchess , along with Prince George and Princess Charlotte , arrived in Canada on Saturday .
The family will travel British Columbia and the Yukon in a visit dotted with stops at First Nations communities and traditional ceremonies .
The visit , said Kensington Palace , â€œwill help celebrate Canadaâ€ ™ s First Nations community , its art and cultureâ€ � ."
2016-11-17,"Poachers killing Africaâ€ ™ s rhinos and elephants are still one step ahead of efforts to stop the multibillion wildlife trade , Prince William has warned .
Traffickers have become more sophisticated and increasingly brutal , and animals are dying in â€œhorrifying numbersâ€ � , the Duke of Cambridge told an international wildlife summit in Hanoi , Vietnam on Thursday .
The princeâ€ ™ s speech came as the UK pledged an extra Â£13 m to tackle the problem and environment secretary , Andrea Leadsom , promised the UK would show leadership to protect precious wildlife .
The UK hosted the first of the wildlife summits in 2014 , where 46 countries agreed an accord to combat the trade .
But the prince said that , despite that global deal and ensuing efforts , the poaching crisis has continued .
â€œThere is much to be proud of and I want to make sure we take confidence from what has been achieved .
We are on the right side of history .
But here is the problem : we know that we arenâ€ ™ t moving fast enough to keep up with the crisis .
Rhinos , elephants , pangolin , lions
â€ “
they are all still being killed in horrifying numbers , â€ � he said .
â€œSo while weâ€ ™ ve made progress , the truth is we are still falling behind .
A betting man would still bet on extinction.â€ �
He said that since the London declaration two years ago , poachersâ€ ™ methods in the â€œkilling fields of Africa and Asiaâ€ � had become more sophisticated , and they were killing more rangers .
But putting an end to the trade was possible and there was widespread international acknowledgement that the killing needed to stop , he said .
â€œIt is only a test of will .
â€œAnd compared to other global problems , I really do believe it is relatively straightforward to solve.â€ � Officials and ministers from 42 countries agreed a joint declaration to follow through on the commitments they made in London , which include tougher enforcement and cracking down on corruption .
Teresa Telecky , director of the wildlife department for the Human Society International , said : â€œThe statement demonstrates high - level government commitment to stamping out poaching and illegal wildlife trade.â€ � Uganda announced it would destroy its 15-tonne stockpile of seized ivory next year , following high - profile ivory destructions such as Kenyaâ€ ™ s burn earlier this year .
The UK said it was committing an extra Â£13 m for measures tackling the crisis , doubling the UKâ€ ™ s funding against the trade .
â€œThe UK is determined to do all we can to show global leadership in fighting the illegal wildlife trade and protecting the worldâ€ ™ s precious wildlife , â€ � said Leadsom .
Ministers in September announced a UK ban on ivory younger than 70 years old , but were criticised by conservationists for stopping shy of a total ban ."

The lead singer , Ruban Nielson , whoâ€ ™ s married , went on holiday and met this girl and fell in love with her , so he came back and told his wife all about her .
She was then so intrigued by her she invited her round , and they all started living together in this three - way relationship .
Then he wrote an album about it , and itâ€ ™ s a really enjoyable soul album that sounds a bit like Stevie Wonder .
It has some juicy trumpets in it , and itâ€ ™ s quite psychedelic as well .
He also did some interviews about the whole situation and they caused a bit of a stir , I think , with the people involved .

I saw this film at Frith Street Gallery in London earlier this year .
Over four performances the artist got the actor Stephen Dillane to perform this piece , but she was sitting at the side and would pass him things he had to read or do during the performance .
Itâ€ ™ s this amazing riddle , and you canâ€ ™ t get to the bottom of whatâ€ ™ s true and what isnâ€ ™ t .
He seems like heâ€ ™ s having a really terrible time , and you canâ€

At one point he said : â€œAn actor is the lowest form of life ; I have no will of my own.â€

This is quite a small place near Finsbury Park .
They just sell sandwiches , really , but it was honestly the best sandwich

It was unbelievable .
We didnâ€ ™ t speak for the whole time we were eating , we just sat there grunting .
It was incredibly rich â€ “
I did manage to finish the sandwich , against my better judgment â€

I thought the projections were amazing : something would happen on the screen and then it would seemingly become actual .
Itâ€ ™ s the best - looking and sounding show I think Iâ€ ™ ve ever seen and
I canâ€ ™ t stop thinking about it .

Itâ€ ™ s this book all the early surrealists were inspired by , and itâ€ ™ s about this godless lunatic called Maldoror .
Itâ€ ™ s very gothic , and itâ€ ™ s got this line in it
they all loved : â€œas beautiful as the chance encounter between a sewing machine and an umbrella on an operating tableâ€ � .
It was written a while before surrealism kicked off , but when it did they all cited it as their big thing .
Itâ€ ™ s a novel in six cantos , or songs , but there isnâ€ ™ t really a plot : itâ€ ™ s a weird , freewheeling flight of fancy .

2017-03-16,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will visit Paris this week as goodwill ambassadors for Britain ahead of the triggering of article 50 .
It will be Prince Williamâ€ ™ s first official visit to the French capital since his mother died there .
During the trip , which Kensington Palace said was at the request of the Foreign Office , the couple will meet senior French politicians is a bid to bolster Anglo - French relations as Britain prepares to exit the European Union .
In a â€œsoft - powerâ€ � diplomatic charm offensive , the couple will follow the Paris tour with visits to Germany and Poland , both major players in the EU , in July .
Meanwhile , Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall , also at the request of the government , will visit Romania , Italy , the Holy See and Austria between 29 March and 6 April , highlighting the UKâ€ ™ s relationship with European partners in areas including social cohesion , military ties and combating human trafficking , according to Clarence House .
The two - day visit to Paris , beginning on 17 March , is the first official visit by Prince William since the death of his mother , Diana , Princess of Wales , in a car crash in the city 20 years ago .
There are said to be no plans for him to visit the scene of the tragedy , at the Pont de lâ€ ™ Alma tunnel .
William has privately visited the city on a few occasions since her death , including going with his brother , Harry , to watch England in the Rugby World Cup in 2007 .
On this official visit , William and Kate will attend the Six Nations rugby international between France and Wales at the Stade de France .
The couple will also be guests of honour at a reception at the British embassy called â€œLes Voisinsâ€ � ( â€œneighboursâ€
� ) , which celebrates cultural ties between the UK and France .
They will meet young French leaders from the arts , sport , fashion , business and voluntary sectors , as well as young military award winners .
They also plan to meet some of those involved in the response to the 2015 terrorist attacks at the Bataclan theatre in Paris as well as the lorry attack in Nice on Bastille Day last year .
A Foreign Office spokesman said that royal visits played a â€œvery important roleâ€ � in British diplomacy .
Plans for the visit have been noted in France , where Gala magazine saw the royal visit as a â€œdiplomatic move â€ ¦ in the run - up to the activation of Article 40 [ sic]â€ � .
Other French publications saw the trip as evidence that the younger royals were taking up the engagement slack so that the Queen , 91 next month , could ease off .
Paris Match published online a 26-photo set of the three outfits the Duchess of Cambridge wore on two previous visits , to Normandy and Picardy .
The couple have enjoyed several holidays in France .
It was during such a private visit that photographs of Kate were taken with a long lens showing her topless on a balcony of a private residence in the south of France .
When the photos were published in the French celebrity magazine Closer in 2012 , the couple pressed for criminal charges in France to prevent wider publication .
Six media representatives face trial over the publication of the topless pictures , with the trial expected to begin in May."
2017-03-17,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are in Paris on their first official visit to the French capital â€
“
the first time Prince William has been on royal duty in the city since his mother , Diana , Princess of Wales , died in a car crash there almost 20 years ago .
William and Catherine flew to the city on Friday in a private jet from London and were driven to the ElysÃ © e Palace for a meeting with French president FranÃ§ois Hollande .
They were greeted on the steps of the palace by Hollande , who was flanked by two members of the Garde rÃ
© publicaine .
After posing for photographers , he led them into the presidentâ€ ™ s residence .
The duchess was wearing the same green Catherine Walker coat she had worn at an earlier engagement in the UK , but had let her hair down .
Before they left , the president took them outside into the gardens of the palace for a second photocall , walking them down a sun - bathed terrace in front of the waiting cameras , stopping to chat occasionally as he pointed out items of interest .
The trip is part of a campaign of â€œsoftâ€ � diplomacy aimed at forging links on the continent as Britain starts delicate and complicated Brexit negotiations .
An aide said of the meeting : â€œThey [ the royal couple ] are very grateful that the president has invited them to the ElysÃ © e Palace for a meeting at the very start of their trip , which gives you an indication of the importance and status of the visit.â€ �
The Cambridges were later driven 100 yards in a black Range Rover for a reception at the British ambassadorâ€ ™
s residence , where they met young entrepreneurs , artists , athletes , musicians and other guests .
William gave a speech to launch Les Voisins â€ “
The Neighbours â€ “ a year - long celebration of Anglo - French links .
The duchess , wearing a black Alexander McQueen cocktail dress , smiled as her husband began speaking in French then switched to English , saying : â€œAnd forgive me if I now continue in the language of Shakespeare , so as to reduce the risk of mangling the language of MoliÃ¨re.â€ � Speaking of historic , current and future links between the two countries , William made reference to Brexit .
â€œLike
all neighbours , sometimes our two nations encourage each other through mutual support , â€ � he told guests .
â€œSometimes we attempt to outdo the other through rivalry â€ “ as we will see tomorrow when Wales play France at the rugby .
But always our two nations continually inspire one another to become better : more creative , more prosperous , more innovative .
â€œThis partnership will continue despite Britainâ€ ™ s recent decision to leave the European Union .
The depth of our friendship and the breadth of our cooperation will not change.â€ �
The duke spoke to a group of athletes , including Col Bertrand Gebuhrer , the leader of the French Invictus team , who appeared confused about whether it was Prince William or Prince Harry who launched the Paralympic games for wounded servicemen and women .
After he suggested that it was Williamâ€ ™ s idea , the duke replied : â€œAs much as it pains me
, I have to give my brother credit for that.â€
�
The duchess met Elizabeth Kesses , a British Paris - based author of books about body issues in young girls .
â€œWe talked about how important these issues are for young girls , and she said I should send her my book , â€ � said Kesses .
On Friday evening the Cambridges attended a dinner hosted by the British ambassador Lord Edward Llewellyn with British and French guests , including actress Kristin Scott - Thomas and French stars Jean Reno and Audrey Tautou .
At the dinner the duke read a message from the Queen .
â€œIt is nearly 70 years since Prince Philip and I first visited France together
â€ “ not long after we were married â€
“
and I retain the fondest memories of my five state visits over the years , as well as an enduring affection for this beautiful country and its people ,
â€ � it said .
â€œAlthough much has changed since my first visit , the ties between our nations have stood the test of time and will , I am sure , continue to prosper.â€ �
On Saturday the royal couple will visit Les Invalides , the French military hospital , where they will meet two survivors of the Paris terror attacks as well as former French servicemen , and visit the Impressionists gallery at the MusÃ
© e dâ€ ™ Orsay before attending the France v Wales Six Nations rugby match .
Royals and Anglo - French diplomacy
William and Kate are not the first royals to head to France amid diplomatic difficulties .
Queen Elizabeth IIâ€
™ s first state visit there , in April 1957 , coincided with the Suez crisis .
Although the two nations were united in the opposition to Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser and their aim to regain western control of the Suez Canal , Franceâ€ ™ s failure to to inform Britain about the involvement of Israel until very close to the commencement of military action in late 1956 strained relations .
The Queenâ€ ™ s official visit to President Coty sought to both soothe and reinforce the UKâ€ ™ s relationship with France .
The Queenâ€ ™ s second state visit in May 1972 was an attempt by France , rather than the United Kingdom , to improve relations regarding UKâ€ ™ s entry into , rather than departure from , the European Economic Community .
President Georges Pompidouâ€ ™ s new government was keen for friendlier dialogue with Britain , welcoming their membership of the EEC , which President de Gaulle had previously opposed .
This would help to pave the way for Britain to do so the next year .
Against a backdrop of gathering menace in Europe in the 1930s , the Queenâ€ ™ s father George VI made similar attempts to bolster Anglo - French relations with an official trip to France in 1938 , which aimed to emphasise the values of the two â€œliberal democraciesâ€ � in the face of the threat from Nazi Germany .

2017-03-17,"Monday Prince William is getting a lot of flak for going on a ladsâ€ ™ ski trip to Verbier , though the headlines of â€œDonâ€ ™ t you have a proper job to go to?â€ � appear to have been mainly an excuse for newspapers to print pictures of the prince drinking and dancing in nightclubs .
Not least because the simple fact is that he doesnâ€ ™ t have a proper job to go to .
Thatâ€ ™ s the whole point of him .
Most of us encounter a sense of existential futility at some point , but few have it embedded in our job description .
Heâ€ ™ s basically twiddling his thumbs waiting for his granny and his father to die .
Itâ€ ™ s almost enough to make a member of the royal family turn republican .
Tuesday Iâ€ ™ ve often wondered how all those people whose lives were improved by the excellence of the medical staff at the Mid Staffs hospital must feel when they read about that hospitalâ€ ™ s many failures .
Just recently I got a message from my psychiatrist â€ “ one of the many mental health professionals who have helped to keep me near enough sane over the years â€ “ to say that they were no longer working with a certain hospital as the risk of damage to their reputation was too high .
In their opinion , the hospital was being badly run and patients werenâ€ ™ t being given the appropriate treatment .
This left me with mixed feelings as I had been a patient at that very hospital and my memories of it are all good .
Iâ€ ™ ve no idea how the hospital was being run behind the scenes , but I was treated with nothing but kindness , consideration and expertise .
Itâ€ ™ s not going too far to say that my four - week stay there transformed my life .
Possibly even saved it .
Maybe I was even luckier than I thought .
Wednesday The publication of Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s tax return from 2005 rather leaves me cold .
One return from 12 years ago proves next to nothing about the presidentâ€ ™ s probity .
Iâ€ ™
d be much more interested in what his returns from the last five years look like and Iâ€ ™ d guess the real dirt might be found in the returns of the four companies that were forced to file for bankruptcy .
Far from being a financial genius , itâ€ ™ s been estimated that Trump would have been richer investing the money he inherited in a Dow Jones tracker fund than in his property empire .
For deeper insights into the real nature of Trumpâ€ ™ s business and tax affairs , try reading Sidney Blumenthalâ€ ™ s essay A Short History of the Trump Family in
this weekâ€ ™ s
London Review of Books .
Blumenthal writes : â€œThe true - life Donald J Trump story has more to do with what Scott Fitzgerald called â€˜foul dustâ€ ™ than with ideas or ideology .
Reckoning with Trump means descending into the place that made him .
What he represents , above all , is the triumph of an underworld of predators , hustlers , mobsters , clubhouse politicians and tabloid sleaze that festered in a corner of New York City , a vindication of his mentor , the Mafia lawyer Roy Cohn , a figure unknown to the vast majority of enthusiasts who jammed Trumpâ€ ™ s rallies and hailed him as the authentic â€˜voice of the peopleâ€ ™

Thursday As a boy growing up in the 60s , I was fascinated by the space race .
I even kept scrap books of newspaper photographs from all the Apollo missions and I remember being allowed to stay up to watch Neil Armstrong step on the moon .
But never once did I dream of being an astronaut .
My appetite for being propelled into space in flimsy â€ “ sometimes dangerous â€ “ craft to spend several months feeling cold , lonely and frightened is non - existent .
For years , Iâ€ ™ ve worn my cowardice as a badge of shame , so Iâ€ ™ m delighted to discover that so many young Russians feel the same way that Roscosmos , the Russian space agency , is having to advertise for more recruits .
For any Russians interested , applicants must be under 35 , have feet under size 11 and relevant work experience .
Friday As George Osborne prepares to keep pushing the â€œnorthern powerhouseâ€ � from the offices of the London Evening Standard , while still fitting in a career as full - time MP and Â£650,000-a - year consultant for BlackRock â€ “ the gig economy is getting to everyone these days â€ “ staff at the news organisation might be wondering what changes lie in store .
Nothing , they hope , as dangerous as one of the jobs I was given when I freelanced there in the 1990s .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve got a great idea , John , â€ �
the features editor said to me over the phone during one stiflingly hot summer .
â€œWhy
donâ€

I replied that one very good reason for not doing it was that I might get killed .
â€œGreat , â€ � she replied .
â€œThat would make the feature even better .
Do you really think you can manage to get yourself hurt?â€

the Evening Standard paid very well â€ “ and headed off to Brixton with a photographer in tow where I studiously ignored all the most terrifying looking drivers whose cars were thudding with heavy bass .

Oh , Iâ€

d be forgiven for thinking so from recent headlines , most notably bringing us news of the compact submersible that takes you down to the floor of the Atlantic to inspect the worldâ€ ™ s most famous shipwreck , and Elon Muskâ€ ™ s SpaceX , apparently preparing to fly private passengers around the Moon .
Few would deny that snooping around the Titanic or circling the lunar surface would be an unimaginably thrilling experience ; if money were no object and fears of the unknown set aside , who would not want to sign up for such an expedition ?
But therein lies the issue : one suspects that the size of the party is an integral component of the attraction .
Nine people can fit into Blue Marble Privateâ€ ™ s seagoing capsule , with the firm making much of the distinguished company theyâ€ ™ ll be joining ; more people , they point out , have been to the top of Everest than have been to the Titanic
( yeah , mainstream mountaineering wimps ) .
Similarly , Musk proposes to take two paying guests on his space flights .
Itâ€ ™ s an extreme version of Sartreâ€ ™ s No Exit , the play in which three strangers wait in a mysterious room for they know not what , and the source of the much - quoted line
â€œhell is other people.â€ �
Imagine trying to commune with the great unknown and some buffoonish Croesus inveigling you into conversation or , worse still , a joint selfie .
Reports of the Titanic shenanigans suggest a couple of days spent learning about the ship itself and general orientation ; to me , this just sounds like the moment youâ€ ™ re corralled into welcome drinks by the jolly - cum - melancholy holiday rep when actually all you want him or her to say is : â€œPool .

Wordsworth would surely have applauded the Maori community that last week secured the Whanganui riverâ€ ™ s legal rights to be treated as a human being after a fight of 140 years .
Those who live by the river see it as their ancestor and , they say , always have .
They are right .

2017-04-17,"The Duke of Cambridge has spoken of his shock at being called out to his first suicide as an air ambulance pilot in a joint interview with his brother , Prince Harry , on tackling masculinity and mental health issues .
Prince William said the â€œtipping pointâ€ � for him in understanding how men struggle to deal with mental health problems came with his work with the East Anglian air ambulance .
â€œMy first callout was to a male suicide and I was told there were five suicides or attempted suicides every day in East Anglia alone .
When I looked into it
I was shocked by how bad this situation is â€ “ suicide is the biggest killer of men under 45 in the UK â€ “ which is absolutely appalling.â€

He praised grime star Stormzy , sportsmen Rio Ferdinand and Freddie Flintoff , and rapper Professor Green for publicly talking about pressures on their mental health .
The interview with the princes is part of a campaign to encourage better communication about mental health issues .
It follows Harryâ€ ™ s revelations that he sought counselling after coming close to a breakdown over the death of his mother and had two years of â€œtotal chaosâ€ � that led him to process his grief .
The interview , with CALMzine , published by the Campaign Against Living Miserably , is for a special edition before the London Marathon , during which the princes and the Duchess of Cambridge will cheer on runners taking part for their mental health campaign ,
Heads Together , which is the charity of the year for the marathon .
Talking about how men often feel it was a sign of weakness to discuss their mental health , William said : â€œThere may be a time and a place for the stiff upper lip , but not at the expense of your health .
The recent interview by Stormzy about his depression was incredibly powerful and will help young men feel that itâ€ ™ s a sign of strength to talk about and look after your mind as well as your body .
He said he hoped subsequent generations would find it more normal to talk about their emotions .
â€œCatherine
and I are clear that we want both George and Charlotte to grow up feeling able to talk about their emotions and
feelings.â€ �
Harry , who served two tours of Afghanistan with the army and who actively campaigned to raise awareness of mental health issues within the military , believed progress was being made .
â€œThe military is a complex picture as on one hand there is an incredible sense of brotherhood and belonging between you and your mates ,
â€ � he told the magazine .
â€œYouâ€ ™ ll do anything for each other â€ “ scrub each otherâ€ ™ s boots , drag each other through the mud â€ “ anything .
â€œYet , on the other hand , this support for each other hasnâ€ ™ t , up to now , included looking after how your buddy is feeling and thinking about things .
When youâ€ ™ re serving you look after your physical health , your training , your equipment , but not your head .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s definitely been a misplaced sense of pride has got in the way of the people in the military community talking about their mental health and getting help .
Itâ€ ™ s changing now and Iâ€ ™ m proud that this is part of the Heads Together campaign .
â€œHopefully , if men see soldiers talking about mental health , it will give them the confidence to do the same.â€ �
In an interview with the Daily Telegraph published on Monday , the prince reflected on the impact of his motherâ€ ™ s death and the time it took him to process it .
â€œ[I thought ]

â€œSo from an emotional side , I was like â€˜right , donâ€ ™ t ever let your emotions be part of anythingâ€ ™ .
So I was a typical 20- , 25- , 28-year - old running around going â€˜life is greatâ€ ™ , or â€˜life is fineâ€ ™ and that was exactly it .
â€œAnd then [ I ] started to have a few conversations and actually all of a sudden , all of this grief that I have never processed started to come to the forefront

2017-05-01,"Ten years ago the News of the Worldâ€ ™ s royal editor , Clive Goodman , and the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire were jailed for intercepting the voicemails of aides to Prince William and Prince Harry .
Andy Coulson resigned from his position as editor of the tabloid shortly afterwards , and an internal investigation concluded phone hacking had been the work of one â€œrogue reporterâ€ � .
But a decade on , phone - hacking cases are still being brought to the high court and the true extent of the practice is still emerging .
Last week the publisher of the Daily Mirror , Sunday Mirror and Sunday People settled phone - hacking claims with 44 celebrities , paying out millions of pounds in compensation and legal costs .
Mark Lewis , a media lawyer at Seddons , said there was now â€œalmost fatigueâ€ � at discovering how extensive phone hacking was .
Lewis represented the Dowler family after it emerged that the News of the World hacked the phone of their missing daughter Milly in 2002 .
â€œIt wasnâ€ ™ t the lie that it was a â€˜rogue reporterâ€ ™ in 2007 , or the lie after Milly Dowler in 2011 that it had stopped , but the fact that it was so extensive that there is almost fatigue at finding out that there are more cases , â€ � he said .
â€œThe lies have been replaced by a shrug and reaction â€ “ â€˜of course theyâ€ ™ re still doing itâ€ ™ .
Many cases to come will show the extent of the wrongdoing.â€ �
Last week was not the first time Mirror Group Newspapers ( MGN ) had been forced to disclose payouts .
Last November it settled with 29 people , last July with 21 , and in September 2014 it settled with six .
In May 2015 it was also ordered by the high court to pay out damages totalling nearly Â£1.25 m , including Â£260,250 to the actor Sadie Frost .
At the time it was a record payout for privacy offences , although it is understood to have been exceeded by some of the settlements reached by MGN this week .
Trinity Mirror , the parent company of MGN , has put aside Â£52.5 m to cover the costs of the hacking scandal , including compensation payouts and legal fees .
There are understood to be about 50 more cases still in the pipeline .
The celebrities in the latest batch of settlements included the former England manager Kevin Keegan , the author Jeffrey Archer , the actor Patsy Kensit and the former home secretary Charles Clarke .
Details about each of their cases , covering allegations of hacking between 1998 and 2010 , were read out in agreed statements to Mr Justice Mann in the high court .
MGN admitted to phone hacking and using private investigators between 1999 and 2007 , but the specific journalists , articles and publications connected to these allegations were not disclosed .
Angela Bostock , the ex - partner of the EastEnders actor Steve McFadden , said police had told her that her details were on PalmPilots â€ “ personal digital assistants â€ “ belonging to Dan Evans , a former Sunday Mirror journalist who pleaded guilty to hacking in 2013 , and Nick Buckley , former deputy editor of the Sunday People and head of news at the Sunday Mirror .
No charges were brought against Buckley .
Nancy Moir , the wife of the comedian Vic Reeves , alleged in her statement that an article published in the Daily Mirror on 1 February 2003 contained private information about her wedding following a suspicious call to her mobile phone .
MGN admitted in the case of Pearl Lowe and Danny Goffey , a fashion designer and musician respectively , that an article published in the Daily Mirror on 5 February 2005 was the product of voicemail interception .
It also admitted in the case of Sheryl Gascoigne , the ex - wife of the footballer Paul Gascoigne , that articles in the People on 9 February and 20 April 2003 and in the Sunday Mirror on 18 May 2003 and 21 March 2004 were the product of hacking .
Piers Morgan , Richard Wallace , Colin Myler , Tina Weaver , Neil Wallis and Mark Thomas all edited Mirror Group newspapers during the periods covered by the allegations , and each have denied being personally involved in phone hacking .
Wallis was found not guilty in 2015 of charges relating to his time at the News of the World .
Elsewhere , a collection of 91 individuals are making hacking claims against News Group Newspapers , part of the Murdoch familyâ€ ™ s News Corp empire , which include allegations against the Sun .
Sir Elton John , Gordon Ramsay and David Tennant are among the alleged victims .
News Group has already settled with more than 1,000 people about hacking , but this was related to the News of the World , which was closed in 2011 at the height of the hacking scandal .
The company has denied that hacking took place at the Sun .
The claims relating to the Sun will be heard in a court case pencilled in for October .
The case threatens to reopen old wounds and put individuals such as Rebekah Brooks â€ “ who was found not guilty of conspiracy to hack voicemails , conspiracy to pay public officials , and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice in 2014 â€ “ back in the witness box .
Brook was reappointed as chief executive of News UK , the parent company of News Group , after she was cleared .
Christopher Hutchings , a media litigation partner at Hamlins and the lead solicitor for the claimants in the case , said : â€œNews Group have always asserted that the police conducted a thorough investigation into hacking at the Sun but following recent disclosure it is clear that there was no such criminal investigation.â€

2017-05-04,"Even by the standards of the British royal family it was an extraordinary revelation .
The Duke of Edinburgh , according to a report by the veteran court correspondent Talbot Church , had been causing more concern than usual in royal circles with his unscripted , off - the - cuff comments .
Shortly before Prince William married Kate Middleton in 2011 , he had accompanied the Queen to meet the bride - to - beâ€ ™ s parents .
Hearing that Carole Middleton had been a flight attendant , he had asked her , â€œIs it true what they say about air stewardesses?â€ � Weeks earlier , during the state visit of Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife , Philip had glanced at Carla Bruni - Sarkoz and muttered to the French president , â€œPunching a bit above your weight there , arenâ€ ™ t you , old chum?â€ �
The problem , Church revealed to readers of the Independent , was that the duke was now suffering from an unusual royal form of Touretteâ€ ™ s syndrome .
When he met someone , he would say the first thing that came into his head , no matter how inappropriate .
As the royal wedding approached , there were worries about what he might say to President Obama , should he attend .
It was all nonsense , of course .
Talbot Church , whose tagline was â€œThe man the royals trustâ€ � , was my parody of the worst kind of ingratiating , oleaginous court correspondent .
Nobody could be taken in , surely .
They were .
The next day , the editor of the Daily Mail , Paul Dacre , stormed into his morning editorial conference and furiously demanded to know why a rival newspaper had landed the great royal Touretteâ€ ™ s scoop .
Now that the duke is retiring from his duties at the age of 95 , it is worth remembering that there are indeed mental issues associated with the Queenâ€ ™ s husband , but they have nothing to do with his state of mind : it is those who admire him one should worry about .
Prince Philip has become a perfect , unimprovable example of how the royal family can reduce millions of people , some of them quite bright and normal , to a state of unquestioning idiocy .
If he were plain Mr Philip Windsor , he would be seen as a tiresome old toff , with some drearily old - fashioned prejudices : an older , snobbier version of Nigel Farage but without the roguish charm .
While other members of his family can be credited with certain public virtues â€ “ a desire to do the right thing , a willingness to play the game with reasonable good humour
â€ “ the duke remains predictably himself .
He is a bit of an old bore and always has been , even when he was young .
Here is the mystery .
Such is the extraordinary grip that the royal family have on the national psyche that , for his many admirers , this very ordinary man has become a sort of fantasy figure , full of the traditional , no - nonsense qualities they long to see in public life .
Such is his wit , apparently , that countless collections of his brilliant aperÃ§us and stunning one - liners have been published .
Hereâ€ ™ s one : to a child who had said he wanted to be an astronaut , Philip said : â€œYou look like you could lose some weight.â€
�
No ?
Letâ€ ™ s try again .
To a woman solicitor , â€œI thought it was against the law to solicit.â€ �
Before you fall off your chair with mirth at these witticisms â€ “ solemnly collected for posterity , remember â€ “ here is one more rib - tickler .
To a photographer who was trying to get the right shot : â€œJust take the fucking photograph.â€ �
To get a better sense of how a charmless man can come to be revered in this odd way , because of his status , it is instructive to look at interviews he has given .
Those privileged enough to be allowed to ask him questions , from Alan Titchmarsh to Trevor McDonald , adopt a simpering tone and say â€œsirâ€ � a lot .
When he can not be bothered to answer a question and replies dismissively , they behave as if something utterly brilliant and rather outrageous has been said .
How difficult had it been to go from being naval officer to being consort to the Queen , Titchmarsh asked .
â€œHow long is a piece of string?â€ � was the weary reply .
Just as class deference runs deep in this country , so do double - standards when it comes to gender roles .
Philip has often been gushingly praised for doing what countless wives of public figures do unnoticed every day â€ “ putting their own careers second to that of their spouse and keeping him company as he works .
Perhaps one should be generous .
After enduring years of pampered boredom , the old boy deserves a rest .
And so do we ."
2017-05-07,"Itâ€ ™ s an uneasy relationship , as any Fleet Street photographer will tell you .
One minute Prince William and family want to be left alone , the next theyâ€ ™ re on a new charm campaign backing good causes .
Thereâ€ ™ s no settled view of where their privacy begins and ends .
Which brings us to the flip - flop being played out in a Nanterre courtroom as the Prince sues a celebrity magazine that , five years ago , took some long - lens snaps of Kate topless in a â€œsecluded villaâ€ � - and demands a â€œpunitiveâ€ � Â£1.3 m in damages ( plus Â£42,000 from a local Provence paper that didnâ€ ™ t do topless ) .
William talks of his â€œpainâ€ � and â€œshockâ€ � , plus â€œthe humiliation heaped on his wifeâ€ � .
What he doesnâ€
™ t explain , though , is why itâ€ ™ s necessary to revive all that pain and angst half a decade later â€ “ especially since , quite clinically , no French court is going to award him more than a ( perhaps humiliating ) fraction of the damages he seeks .
A future monarch needs a better legal advice team .
Or maybe just have a word with the Duke of Edinburgh before he goes .
â€¢
So the best commercial prize for British backbone goes to ITV .
Maybe the Strong - and - Stable One is too busy to debate with other party leaders .
Maybe Jeremy Corbyn wonâ€ ™ t turn up if sheâ€ ™ s not there .
But at least â€ “ come 18 May
â€ “
Julie Etchingham and an audience will have the other leadership hopefuls together and on air .
Itâ€ ™ s an important point of principle , especially after Franceâ€ ™ s climactic two - hour contest â€ “ four times the length of the average Panorama
, please note â€ “ between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen .
Viewers want some kind of national moment .
They need to see contacts dictated to suit them , rather than meddling tribes of spin doctors .
They will , perhaps , feel just a little disillusionment about a national leader too terse and lofty to talk to them direct .
Now over to the BBC â€ ¦ ?
Your turn to be brave ."
2017-05-10,"Some newspaper coverage ahead of the BBC2 screening of King Charles III â€ “ a drama imagining a brief and catastrophic reign for the current Prince of Wales â€
“ gave the impression that Lord Hall of Birkenhead , the BBC director - general , should be held in the Tower of London awaiting execution for treason .
But the summons he seems more likely to get is to next yearâ€ ™ s Bafta TV awards , where the BBC will surely be honoured for one of its boldest drama commissions .
Some Tory politicians and royal biographers had frothed about the content of a piece that includes shots of Elizabeth
IIâ€ ™ s
funeral procession ; the ghost of Diana , Princess of Wales , speaking prophecies to her ex - husband and elder son ; and Camilla , Duchess of Cornwall , slapping Prince William for plotting to seize the throne from his father .
The objectors hadnâ€ ™ t seen the original play but considered even the idea lese - majesty .
Those not calling for the DGâ€ ™ s head were perhaps aware that the script had not been hatched by a bunch of crazed republicans in a Broadcasting House bunker .
King Charles III is an adaptation of a stage play by Mike Bartlett already performed around 400 times in London and New York , transferring to the West End and Broadway after its premiere at the Almeida theatre in north London in 2014 .
Such moments as Camillaâ€ ™ s slap and Dianaâ€ ™ s ghost â€
“ white - dressed at the end of a long corridor beside an eerily rocking childâ€ ™ s rocking horse â€ “ will inevitably have caused more shock on TV , where it is easier for the potentially offended to stumble on the stuff , than in the theatre , where the response was standing ovations and award nominations .
However , TV viewers have now seen that the play is not an exercise in Spitting Image - style satire : the actors sample some mannerisms from their Windsor originals , but give imaginative portrayals , rather than Bremner - esque impressions .
Nor could the script ever be mistaken for a docudrama .
King Charles III is a futuristic what - if â€ “ set in around 2022 â€ “ which becomes a political thriller , a Palace of Cards if you will , when the new monarch refuses to sign a parliamentary bill he dislikes , causing a constitutional crisis and civil unrest .
Distanced not only by time but style , it is written in blank verse ,
Bartlettâ€ ™ s governing conceit being that Shakespeare had survived to characterise Charles III as he did the various Richards and Henrys .
Conceived as a pastiche of dramatic tragedy , the play now trails a real one , in the sudden death last month of Tim Pigott - Smith , who played the title role on stage and screen and whose performance now becomes his memorial .
Pigott - Smithâ€ ™ s performance and Bartlettâ€ ™ s script avoid any trace of the pettiness , temper and self - indulgence attributed to Charles by biographers , offering a plausible emotive portrait of a man who has waited more than 70 years to start work , then finds himself incapable of being just a face on the stamps and banknotes .
â€œWhat am I?,â€ �
Charles asks , a line that Pigott - Smith , with an agonised sigh , makes as existentially heart - wrenching as Hamletâ€ ™ s To be , or not to be .
Even the constitutional crisis Charles provokes is a kindly choice .
Bartlett doesnâ€ ™ t imagine him leading a military dictatorship or massacring modernist architects , but standing up for the freedom of the press ( something that has never seemed high on the agenda of the real Prince of Wales ) .
And , in one sense , the play is optimistic and reassuring for monarchists .
The coronation oath taken here makes the King of England monarch of territories still including Scotland , Northern Ireland , Wales , Australia , New Zealand and Canada , which only a plucky royalist would bet their Buckingham Palace garden party ticket on at this point .
Much of the play has been cut â€
“
the 90-minute TV slot is an hour shorter than the theatrical playing time â€ “ and some of the excisions make the text less challenging to BBC editorial guidelines .
Rupert Goold , who directed the play in both media , admitted in an interview that the broadcaster had expressed unease with Dianaâ€ ™ s ghost mocking Prince Charlesâ€ ™ s suitability to rule .
That speech has gone .
Electioneering politicians may be relieved as well that a speech from the play in which a kebab - seller laments the shrinking of Britain ( â€œcut the army â€ ¦ squeeze the NHS â€ ¦ the Post Office closed â€ ¦ Devolution .
Less and lessâ€ � ) becomes on TV a metaphor in which the Queen holds the UK together like the metal spit that splits a turning slab of doner meat .
Parts of the play are genuinely shocking , with the attitude of viewers depending on whether they believe living royals should be protected from fictional representation ( as they effectively were in Britain until the 1980s ) , or conclude that inclusion in a drama can be no worse than the intrusions into their privacy the Windsors suffer regularly .
One pre - transmission furore concerned a line in which a nightclubber repeats gossip about Prince Harryâ€ ™ s paternity .
But , in the context , this claim is spoken by a committed republican , who subsequently recants , and clearly represents the sort of stuff the princes have to put up with .
Richard Gouldingâ€ ™ s vulnerable , touching Harry seems a fair guess about the psyche of the fifth in line to the throne .
Bartlett also gave his prince a romance with a sparky outsider , played by Tamara Lawrance , long before the real Harryâ€ ™ s relationship with Meghan Markle .
The appearance of Dianaâ€ ™ s ghost , as well as being a nod to Shakespearean convention , also seems a reasonable presentation of the way Charles , William and Harry are shadowed by the dead princess both historically and , as her sons have acknowledged in frank interviews , psychologically .
Whether or not you believe that William and Catherine would ever , like Cambridge Macbeths , mount a palace coup , Oliver Chris and Charlotte Riley are completely convincing in suggesting how such a conflict of loyalties would play out within the family .
King Charles III , on TV , is two different things : an outrage for those who believe the monarchy should always be reverenced , especially by the BBC , but also a drama with the highest quality of acting , writing and filming .
Strangely , those versions sometimes co - exist : a paper whose front page railed against the BBC for questioning Prince Harryâ€ ™ s DNA gave the play a five - star preview on its TV pages on the same day ."
2017-06-01,"Prince William and Prince Harry are to talk for the first time about the immediate aftermath of the death of Princess Diana for a new BBC1 documentary .
With the 20th anniversary of their motherâ€ ™ s death in Paris approaching in August , the pair will discuss the events that followed in a special film , provisionally called Diana .
Friends and family of the royals will also appear in the feature - length documentary , many of them talking for the first time about their experiences .
Although the brothers have recently been in the public eye talking about mental health and appearing on the BBC1â€ ™ s
Mind
Over Marathon programme , BBC controller of factual commissioning Alison Kirkham told the Guardian approaches were made to Kensington Palace prior to that .
She said the interviews with the princes have already been recorded , â€œand while theyâ€ ™ ve spoken about their grief and about the challenges theyâ€ ™ ve had in the wake of their motherâ€ ™ s death theyâ€ ™ ve never before spoken about that period : of learning about their motherâ€ ™ s death , the reaction to that huge public mourning and the funeral itself .
â€œItâ€ ™ s the first time they will be sharing their memories and recollections of that particular week in time .
This will be a moment of national remembrance ; she was an extraordinarily popular and potent figure.â€
�
In the new documentary Diana , Prince William explains : â€œPart of the reason why Harry and I want to do this is because we feel we owe it to her â€
¦ I think an element of it is feeling like we let her down when we were younger .
We couldnâ€ ™ t protect her .
We feel we at least owe her 20 years on to stand up for her name and remind everybody of the character and person that she was .
Do our duties as sons in protecting her.â€ �
Prince Harry added : â€œWhen she died there was such an outpour of emotion and love which was quite , which was shocking .
It was beautiful at the same time , and it was amazing , now looking back at it , it was amazing that our mother had such a huge effect on so many people .
â€œWhen youâ€ ™ re that young and something like that happens to you
I think
itâ€ ™ s lodged in here , there , wherever â€ “ in your heart , in your head
and it stays there for a very very long time .
I think itâ€ ™ s never going to be easy for the two of us to talk about our mother , but 20 years on seems like a good time to remind people of the difference that she made not just to the Royal Family but also to the world.â€ �
Despite the sensitivity surrounding the show the BBC will retain editorial control , with more details of the participants to be revealed over the coming months .
The programme was announced by Kirkham as she also unveiled 30 hours of new shows , some of which will focus on perceived taboos , such as Abortion : What Britain Really Thinks , presented by Anne Robinson ; Chris Packham : Me and My Aspergerâ€ ™ s ; and Who
Should We Let
In ?
Ian Hislop on the First Great Immigration Row .
Others will tap into issues such as self - image with Claudia Winkleman fronting The Makeover Show â€ “ the first BBC fashion fix series since Susannah Constantine and Trinny Woodallâ€ ™ s hit series What Not to Wear â€ “ while Earth From Space will use space cameras to look at the natural world as it has never been seen before .
There is also a return for Nigella Lawson who will share recipes she makes for family and friends , as well as fresh takes on classic meals she has evolved into colourful dishes in BBC2â€ ™ s six - part series , Nigella :
At My Table ( a working title ) .
Lawson said : â€œIâ€ ™ m excited to be making this new series and to share with viewers many new recipes alongside favourites that have evolved as Iâ€ ™ ve cooked them over the years .
â€œAt
My Table continues my celebration of home cooking , infusing every day with pleasure and flavour .
What matters most in life is the connections we have with each other and food is always at the heart of this.â€ � BBC2â€ ™ s
Britainâ€ ™ s Greatest Invention will have presenters arguing the case for different innovations .
The advocates include Sir Trevor McDonald , David Harewood , Len Goodman and Angela Rippon .
The show is under the BBCâ€ ™ s Tomorrowâ€ ™ s World season of programmes and while Kirkham said she â€œwouldnâ€ ™ t rule outâ€ � a regular general science magazine show , there were â€œno plans at the momentâ€ � to bring back classic science series Tomorrowâ€ ™ s World itself .
Other new programmes include H is for Hawk : A New Chapter , following bestselling author Helen Macdonald as she trains a goshawk as part of grieving for her late father , a series about country vicars called A Vicarâ€ ™ s Life and a season of history programmes to mark the 70th anniversary of the partition of India .
â€œI think factual television should be complicated and brave enough to explore difficult , challenging topics given that they are the topics people are worried about at home , â€ � said Kirkham .
â€œWhat we absolutely need to avoid is bland , passive output .
In my experience when you underestimate the audience they donâ€ ™ t reward you ; when you really challenge them they come in huge numbers , they value complexity.â€ � Pointing to the BBCâ€ ™ s recent TV Baftas triumph where it swept the board for factual shows , she said it was a vindication of the popularity of shows such as Planet Earth 2 and Great British
Bake Off amid the current trend for big dramas .
â€œJust a few years ago there were people decrying factual and predicting the demise of it .
Drama and entertainment have always had wonderful places in bringing audiences together but I fervently believe in factual .
â€œFactual can still innovate and bring huge audiences together , whether itâ€ ™ s Planet Earth 2 earning the biggest natural history audience for 15 years or Rio Ferdinand : Being Mum and Dad being watched by nearly 7 million on BBC1 and another 30 million people watching the shorts online , both with hugely young - skewing audiences.â€ � â€œWe live in an era of seismic changes and ever - changing landscape with the much talked - about fake news and false facts and people want to understand and make more informed decisions about their world , and I think thatâ€ ™ s the responsibility and privilege of the BBC as a public service broadcaster to step into that vacuum and earn and respect the trust we have with our audiences.â€ �"

2017-07-23,"Dressed as policemen , with toy helmets and walkie - talkies , or onboard the royal yacht , Britannia , these photographs of Prince William and Prince Harry are from the personal album belonging to their mother , Diana , Princess of Wales , published for the first time to mark a documentary on her life to be broadcast on Monday .
The now Duke of Cambridge and Harry have opened up publicly to speak candidly about their grief , their loss , and coping without their mother , who died after a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997 .
Twenty years on , they reveal their deep regret that their last conversation was a brief phone call from her in Paris that was cut short because they were playing with their cousins at Balmoral , the Queenâ€ ™ s Scottish estate .
â€œHarry and I were in a desperate rush to say â€˜goodbyeâ€ ™ , â€˜see you laterâ€ ™ and â€˜weâ€
™ re going to go offâ€ ™ ... if Iâ€ ™
d known what would happen
I wouldnâ€ ™ t have been so blase about it .
But that phone call sticks in my mind quite heavily , â€ � says William , who was 15 when his mother died .
Harry , who was 12 , reveals he grew up thinking â€˜not having a mother was normalâ€ ™ , and says he has cried only twice since , the first time when Diana was buried on an island at Althorp , her familyâ€ ™ s ancestral home .
They remember the â€œbest mother everâ€ � who â€œbrought a breath of fresh air to everything she didâ€ � .
They laugh over how she once surprised William , then 12 or 13 , by inviting three models to meet him at home , leaving him tongue - tied and blushing .
Her motto , according to Harry , was â€œyou can be as naughty as you want â€ “
just donâ€ ™ t get caughtâ€
� .
Then there was her penchant for dressing them up in bizarre costumes .
Harry said : â€œOne thing I would love to ask her now , because I genuinely think that she got satisfaction out of dressing myself and William up in the most bizarre outfits , normally matching .
â€œIt was weird shorts and , you know , little sort of shiny shoes with the old clip on .
Looking back at the photos it just makes me laugh
â€
“
I just think : â€˜How could you do that to us?â€

Speaking openly about his mother for the ITV documentary had been â€œdauntingâ€ � at first , but a â€œhealingâ€ � process , William told journalists .
He said he hoped it would remind the public , especially generations too young to remember , of his motherâ€ ™
s
warmth and humour and also her achievements .
The programme chronicles Dianaâ€ ™ s personal story , including her campaigns supporting the homeless and people with Aids , and against land mines .
William said : â€œWe wonâ€ ™ t be doing this again
â€ “ we wonâ€ ™ t speak as openly or publicly about her again , because we feel hopefully this film will provide the other side from close family friends you might not have heard before , from those who knew her best and from those who want to protect her memory , and want to remind people of the person that she was.â€

2017-07-25,"Lucky Whitehead may want to consider going by his birth name of Rodney after an extraordinary week of bad news .
The wide receiver , who has played in the No13 shirt during his career , was released by the Dallas Cowboys on Monday after reports emerged he had missed a court hearing relating to a case in which he had stolen $ 40 worth of goods from a Virginia convenience store in June .
However , on Tuesday , Prince William County police said they were confident the man charged with the crime had falsely given Whiteheadâ€ ™ s name when he was arrested .
That tallied with Whiteheadâ€ ™ s agent , Dave Rich , who said his client wasnâ€ ™ t in the state at the time of the theft .
Prince William police said it â€œregrets the impact these events had on Mr Whitehead and his family.â€ �
On Tuesday , Whitehead said he was disappointed at the Cowboysâ€ ™ s handling of the situation .
â€œAs far as the whole situation went down , I was blindsided , â€ � he told the Dallas Morning News .
â€œI
didnâ€

Clearly because I wasnâ€ ™ t the person arrested .
The head person [ at the Cowboys ]
I told , no one backed me up .
No one had my back in the whole situation .
I knew about it at what ?
12.45 .
By 2.30 Iâ€ ™ m released ...
Letâ€ ™ s not sugarcoat anything .
I was pretty much being called a liar.â€ �
Last week , Whitehead was caught up in another bizarre incident when he said his dog , Blitz , had been kidnapped and ransomed for $ 20,000 .
The story became stranger when video emerged of a rapper , Boogotti Kasino , with Blitz .
Kasino said he had not kidnapped the dog but had bought it and wanted Whitehead to reimburse him .
Blitz has since been returned safely .
Whitehead was left off the roster for a game last year when he missed a team meeting , apparently after a late night out .
ESPNâ€ ™ s
Josina Anderson said a Cowboys source had told her Whiteheadâ€ ™ s release would stand , and was due to an effort â€œto improve the roster from an ability and team culture standpoint.â€ �
The Cowboys have had a troubled off - season .
As well as the Whitehead saga , star running back Ezekiel Elliott was allegedly involved in an altercation at a bar on Sunday but was not charged , while wide receiver
Dez Bryant missed a team meeting .
Rich said he was confident his client has a future in the league .

â€œThey needed to make an example of somebody to get those boysâ€ ™ heads on straight .
It is calculated .
But I get it .

2017-08-02,"One of the last surviving Battle of Britain Spitfire pilots , Ken Wilkinson , has died , keeping a twinkle in his eye and a taste for red wine and blue jokes to the end .
Wilkinson , who celebrated his 99th birthday in June , was one of the last of those dubbed â€œThe Fewâ€ � by Winston Churchill , at a time when the life expectancy of a Spitfire pilot was about four weeks .
The former pilot jokingly rebuked Prince William for â€œflying choppersâ€ � instead of
â€œproper planesâ€ � recently , and after admitting that he had promised not to tell any of his extensive repertoire of dirty jokes , agreed to recount one by royal command .
The Battle of Britain Memorial trust described Fg Off Kenneth Astill Wilkinson as â€œa true gentleman who we shall miss dearlyâ€ � .
Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier , the chief of air staff , said : â€œKen , as one of The Few , represented an extraordinary generation to whom we owe a great debt that should never be forgotten , our freedom being won by their sacrifices.â€ �
Although he never forgot the horrors of the combat , recalling in one interview watching â€œfriends fall out of the sky , aircraft go up in flames ...
terrible
thingsâ€ � , Wilkinson was fondly remembered by friends and acquaintances for his sense of humour .
Deborah Burns , whose late husband , Flt Lt Owen Burns , was also a Battle of Britain veteran , recalled Wilkinson as one of â€œthe Brylcreem Boys with a twinkle in their eyesâ€ � .
In an interview in 2015 Wilkinson said : â€œI didnâ€ ™ t carry any lucky charms , but I did wear a pair of my wifeâ€ ™ s knickers around my neck.â€ �
He met the Duke of Cambridge in the same year , at an event marking the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , and confided he was â€œunder instructionsâ€ � not to turn the air blue .
Prompted , he recounted the story of Joe , who insisted on being addressed by full title after promotion to high office at his golf club , hopping into bed with his wife and announcing himself as the Captain .
She responds : â€œYou have to be quick , Joe will be home soon.â€ � Wilkinson , who worked as a chartered surveyor in Birmingham after the war , was the son of an aircraft manufacturer in Barrow - in - Furness , Cumbria , and became fascinated by flying while watching aircraft tests at Farnborough .
He joined the RAF at the outbreak of the second world war and flew Spitfires with 616 and 19 Squadrons , on missions protecting industrial sites in the Midlands .
Frank Crosby , an author and heritage consultant who knew Wilkinson through working at the Imperial War Museumâ€ ™ s Duxford site , said the veteran once offered to contribute to a whip - round for his own funeral wreath , on learning of the death of a pilot namesake .
â€œTheir way of surviving was hardening themselves to what happened around them .
But he was very aware of the men who died around him in the sky .
He would talk about them and he wouldnâ€ ™ t get sentimental about them , but he never forgot.â€ �
Former RAF navigator John Nichol , who was shot down and captured during the first Gulf war in 1991 , tweeted a tribute to Wilkinson :"
2017-08-22,"Princes William and Harry have revealed how the Queen and Prince Charles sought to shield them for as long as possible from the hysteria that swept Britain 20 years ago after the death of their mother , Diana .
In a BBC documentary due to be broadcast on Sunday , they recall how they were kept away from public view on the Queenâ€ ™ s Balmoral estate , knowing nothing of the extraordinary response throughout the country .
â€œAt the time , you know , my grandmother wanted to protect her two grandsons , and my father as well .
Our grandmother deliberately removed the newspapers , and things like that , so there was nothing in the house at all .
So we didnâ€ ™ t know what was going on , â€ �
William tells the makers of Diana , 7 Days .
The second in line to the throne says he was thankful for â€œthe privacy to mourn , to collect our thoughts , and to just have that space away from everybodyâ€ � .
The period of seclusion in Scotland , while members of the public placed an avalanche of flowers outside Dianaâ€ ™ s Kensington Palace home and beneath the bare flagpole at Buckingham Palace , led at the time to a wave of public criticism of the royal family .
The documentary , by the award - winning film - maker Henry Singer , charts the tumultuous week between Dianaâ€ ™ s death in a Paris car crash and her Westminster Abbey funeral through interviews with politicians , family and friends .
William and Harry speak of the effect of their motherâ€ ™ s death on their father , and appear to confirm that he broke the news to them .
â€œOne of the hardest things for a parent to have to do
is tell your children that your other parent has died .
How you deal with that , I donâ€ ™ t know , â€ � says Harry .
â€œBut he was there for us .
He was the one out of two left .
And he tried to do his best and to make sure that we were protected and looked after .
But he was going through the same grieving process as well.â€ �
In a series of high - profile interviews in the run - up to the 20th anniversary on 31 August , the brothers have spoken candidly about their grief , but until now have not spoken of their fatherâ€ ™ s role .
They also reveal their struggle to balance public expectation with private grief .
When the Queen , bowing to public pressure , returned early to London from Balmoral , the shocked and bewildered young princes , then 15 and 12 , found themselves performing a walkabout in a weeping crowd , being grabbed by strangers with tear - soaked hands thrusting flowers at them .
Deciding when the time was right to put on their â€œprince hatâ€ � and â€œgame faceâ€ � and be seen to mourn in public had been â€œa very hard decision for my grandmother to makeâ€ � , says William .
â€œShe felt very torn between being the grandmother to William and Harry , and her Queen role .
And I think she â€ “ everyone
â€ “ was surprised and taken aback by the scale of what happened and the nature of how quickly it all happened.â€
�
Deciding whether Dianaâ€ ™ s sons should walk behind her coffin was also difficult .
â€œIt wasnâ€ ™ t an easy decision , â€ � says William .
It was a collective family decision .
â€œIt was one of the hardest things I have ever done , â€ � he adds , saying he put his head down and â€œhid behind my fringeâ€ � .
â€œIt was a very long and lonely walk.â€ �
Harry says : â€œI think it was a group decision .
But before I knew it I found myself with a suit on , with a black tie and white shirt , and I was part of it .
Generally , I donâ€ ™ t have an opinion on whether that was right or wrong .
Iâ€ ™ m glad I was part of it .
Looking back on it now , Iâ€ ™ m very glad I was part of it.â€ �
His comments contrast with an interview he gave to Newsweek in June in which he said â€œno child should have to do that under any circumstanceâ€ � .
In the documentary the brothers recall the silence of much of the walk , but also the wails of people in the crowd .
William admits he could not then understand why strangers who did not know his mother â€œwanted to cry as loud as they didâ€ � .
Now , looking back , he understands better the influence his mother had had .
Both parents had taught them about duty and responsibility , says William ,
â€œbut
I have to say when it becomes that personal as walking behind your motherâ€ ™ s funeral cortege , it goes to another level of dutyâ€ � .
He felt his mother was â€œwalking beside us to get us throughâ€ � .
As headlines complained about the Queenâ€ ™ s supposed lack of public emotion over Dianaâ€ ™ s death , Tony Blair , then prime minister , and his communications chief , Alastair Campbell , sensed tensions rising .
The Queen announced the union flag would fly at half - mast over Buckingham Palace for the funeral , and she and the Duke of Edinburgh met the grieving public at the palace .
â€œYou felt the tension lifting , you felt it straight away , â€ � says Campbell of the walkabout .
Blair believed the palace needed to make an extraordinary gesture to appease a public increasingly hostile towards the royals .
There was the risk â€œthat the countryâ€ ™
s
sense of loss turned to a sense of anger and grievance , and then turned against the monarchyâ€ � .
The Queen , he says , â€œwas obviously very sad about Diana , she was concerned about the monarchy itselfâ€
� .
He adds : â€œThey needed to see her vulnerable as a person , and not simply vulnerable as a monarch.â€ �
Her unprecedented live broadcast in which she paid tribute to Diana , speaking as a queen â€œand a grandmotherâ€ � , was crucial .
She had needed to â€œbring the nation behind herâ€ � .
â€œThese were modern times .
We were approaching the 21st century , and for the people of the country , including particularly the younger generations coming up , the old deference towards the monarchy wasnâ€ ™ t enough , and in some cases wasnâ€ ™ t there .
So this respect had to be renewed in a new way , â€ � Blair says .
â€œI
think by the end of that week we had come to almost a new settlement , if you like , between monarchy and people.â€
�
The Queen had shown that the royal family had the capacity to â€œadapt and adjustâ€ � .

2017-09-05,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have welcomed a French court verdict that paparazzi photos of Kate topless on holiday were an invasion of the royal coupleâ€ ™ s privacy .
Twenty - four hours after the announcement that Kate and Prince William were expecting their third child , the court in Nanterre , west of Paris , awarded them â‚¬100,000 ( Â£91,000 ) in damages and interest to be paid by the celebrity magazine Closer and two photographers .
The magazineâ€ ™ s editor and the CEO of its publisher were each fined a further â‚¬45,000 â€ “ the maximum allowed .
The awards , while high for a French court , are considerably lower than the â‚¬1.5 m the coupleâ€ ™ s legal team had demanded .
After the verdict , royal aides said the couple had suffered an â€œunjustified intrusionâ€ � and were pleased the judge had found in their favour .
â€œThe incident was a serious breach of privacy , and their royal highnesses felt it essential to pursue all legal remedies , â€ � a statement read .
A lawyer for Closer , Paul - Albert Iweins , said the damages award was in line with previous payouts but that the fines were â€œexaggerated considering it was a simple case of privacyâ€ � .
Six people , including three photographers , were tried this year after long - lens pictures of the couple on holiday in France were published in the French celebrity magazine and a local newspaper , La Provence .
The photographs were taken in the summer of 2012 and show the royal couple on a terrace by a swimming pool at a private chateau owned by Viscount Linley , the Queenâ€ ™ s nephew , in the Luberon , Provence .
Splashed across the cover of Closer under the headline : â€œOh
My God [ in English ] : the photos that will go around the world , â€ � the photos show the duchess wearing only the bottom half of her bikini .
There were more topless photographs on the inside pages .
A week before the Closer pictures were published , La Provence carried a photograph of Kate in the same property wearing a swimsuit .
The photographs were reportedly offered to British publications , which turned them down .
After Closer hit the newsstands , the couple were granted an immediate injunction preventing the photos being used elsewhere , but they still appeared in several European publications .
Their lawyers asked that Closer be ordered to pay â‚¬1.5 m in damages and compensation for the â€œshockâ€ � of seeing the paparazzi photographs printed , and a further â‚¬50,000 from La Provence .
In a letter to the court â€ “ read at a hearing in May â€
“ William wrote that the case was â€œparticularly shocking because it reminded us of the harassment that led to the death of my mother , Diana , Princess of Walesâ€ � .
Diana was killed in a car accident in August 1997 while being chased through a Paris underpass by photographers .
Her boyfriend , Dodi Fayed , and the carâ€ ™ s driver , Henri Paul , who had been drinking , were also killed .
In his declaration , the duke said : â€œIn September 2012 , my wife and I thought that we could go to France for a few days in a secluded villa owned by a member of my family , and thus enjoy our privacy .
We know France and the French and we know that they are , in principle , respectful of private life , including that of their guests .
The clandestine way in which these photographs were taken was particularly shocking to us as it breached our privacy.â€ �
St Jamesâ€ ™ s Palace issued a statement at the time describing the incident as being â€œreminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of Diana , Princess of Walesâ€ � .
The public prosecutor had also asked for â€œvery significantâ€ � fines for Closerâ€ ™ s editor , Laurence Pieau , Ernesto Mauri â€ “
the CEO of publisher Mondadori â€ “ and two Paris picture agency photographers , Cyril Moreau and Dominique Jacovides ,
suspected of having taken the shots .
The pair , along with Valerie Suau from La Provence , faced charges of invading or being complicit to an invasion of William and Kateâ€ ™ s privacy .
Moreau and Jacovides , who denied the charges , were each fined â‚¬10,000 , of which half was suspended .
Suau was given a â‚¬1,000 suspended fine and the newspaper director at the time the pictures were published , Marc Auburtin , was given a â‚¬1,500 suspended fine .
Auburtin and Suau were jointly ordered to pay â‚¬3,000 damages to the couple .
Suau admitted taking photographs of the royal couple at the Linley property , but said she did not consider them to be a breach of privacy .
French courts do not usually make large awards in such cases .
The former president FranÃ§ois Hollandeâ€ ™ s partner , Julie Gayet , was awarded â‚¬15,000 after Closer published pictures of them , and Florian Philippot , a vice - president of the far - right Front National , received a â‚¬20,000 award for the publication of photos of him with another man , said to be his partner .
During the May hearing , Iweins attacked the â€œAnglo - Saxon reasoning behind punitive damages and compensationâ€ � and said the trial was hypocritical .
â€œThe public and private lives of the royal couple are so closely linked as to be inseparable , â€ � Iweins said , adding that the photographs cast the young couple in a positive light .
â€œItâ€ ™ s of public interest to know that future heirs to the throne have a solid relationship and are getting on well .
Itâ€ ™ s all part of the royal business , â€ � he said .
Closer is owned by the Italian - based Mondadori Group , one of the biggest publishing companies in Europe , which owns several high - profile glossy magazines including Grazia ."
2017-09-19,"The debate around the legalisation of drugs has been raging for decades with everyone from rock stars to the British Medical Journal wading in .
Now a member of the royal family has joined the discussion .
But it was neither Prince Harry , famous for being a bit of a hellraiser , nor his notoriously outspoken father Prince Charles who brought the subject up but the normally reserved William who asked former addicts the â€œmassive questionâ€
� â€ “
should the ban on drugs be lifted ?
The Duke of Cambridge spoke about the subject while on a visit to drug addiction charity the Spitalfields Crypt Trust in east London .
William asked three people who have been helped by the charity their opinions on whether drugs should be legalised .
He did not give his personal opinion but told the trio it was a â€œquestion I had to askâ€ � .
Sitting in the trustâ€ ™ s art room , the duke said : â€œCan I ask you a very massive question ?
Itâ€ ™ s a big one ,
thereâ€
™ s obviously a lot of pressure growing in areas about legalising drugs and things like that :
what are your individual opinions on that ?
â€œI
know
itâ€
™ s a big question , but you seem like the key people to actually get a very good idea as to , you know , what are the big dangers there .
What are the feelings?â€
�
Heather Blackburn said she thought the legalisation of drugs was a good idea and that money was wasted on â€œdrug lawsâ€ � .
She added : â€œMost of the people Iâ€ ™ ve known in recovery , 95 % had massive trauma and terrible stuff happen to them and using drugs to cope and then you get put in prison , you donâ€
™ t get the facilities and the actual help you need , you get punished ... which is not going to help anyone taking drugs , itâ€ ™ s going to do even more harm , I think.â€ �
She added that there should be more help , such as psychiatry , so people could turn their lives around earlier .
The duke then asked whether prison tackles the root cause of why someone is taking drugs , to which Blackburn replied : â€œNo , it just punishes what youâ€ ™ ve done , not the reasons why.â€ � Recovering alcoholic Grace Gunn , 19 , who is training to become a midwife , told the future king : â€œYou canâ€ ™ t just say , you know , â€˜drugs are illegalâ€ ™ or â€˜now we can all go and do drugsâ€ ™ , because it doesnâ€ ™ t stop the fact weâ€ ™ re a nation of people hurting , and we canâ€ ™ t undo all that overnight .
It takes a long period of time.â€ � Jason Malham , a 45-year - old recovering heroin addict originally from Melbourne in Australia , said : â€œPersonally , I believe that they should not be made legal.â€
�
At the end of the discussion the duke thanked the group for giving him a â€œvery useful little snapshotâ€ � , adding : â€œTalking to you and being here it feels like a question I had to ask , I appreciate your honesty.â€
�
As he said his goodbyes William , in a jokey reference to the birth of his third child expected next spring , told Gunn : â€œAll the best with the midwifery â€ “ might see you sooner than you think.â€ �
Williamâ€ ™ s question to the recovering addicts was welcomed by Danny Kushlick , head of external affairs at Transform , a charitable thinktank that campaigns for the legal regulation of drugs in the UK and internationally .
Kushlick said : â€œThe protocol in the [ Westminster ] village is â€˜we donâ€ ™ t talk about drugsâ€ ™ .
Thatâ€ ™ s why we appreciate the courage and foresight of Prince William to be stepping into the debate where even seasoned politicians wonâ€ ™ t
go.â€ �
The governmentâ€ ™ s drug policy is not likely to change in the foreseeable future .
In its drug strategy , published in July it said : â€œWe have no intention of decriminalising drugs .
Drugs are illegal because scientific and medical analysis has shown they are harmful to human health .
â€œDrug misuse is also associated with much wider societal harms including family breakdown , poverty , crime and anti - social behaviour .
We are aware of decriminalisation approaches being taken overseas , but it is overly simplistic to say that decriminalisation works.â€ �"
2017-09-20,"The Duke of Cambridge reignited debate surrounding the legalisation of drugs following his recent visit to the Spitalfields Crypt Trust in east London , where he had â€œa very massive questionâ€ � for former addicts .
Should drugs be legal â€ “ what were their opinions ?
Responses from those at the drug - addiction charity were mixed and the much - discussed issue continues to prove contentious among everyone , from politicians to academics , drug - users and medical experts .
With the UK currently the drugs - overdose capital of Europe , could a change in Britainâ€ ™ s drug policy save lives ?
Or is legalisation a recipe for disaster ?
David Nutt
What did Prince William mean when he said â€œlegalisingâ€
� ?
This term covers a wide range of possible alternative approaches , ranging from a completely free market in all drugs ( which I oppose ) to some form of decriminalised access for some drugs ( which I support for drugs that are less harmful to users than alcohol ) .
I suspect he meant decriminalisation of drug possession because we have good evidence from other countries that this works .
The Dutch model for cannabis allows access to cannabis in small ( max 5 g ) quantities for personal possession , and for more than 30 years it has worked very well .
The Dutch do not use any more cannabis than us but do know what type and strength they are getting .
Even more importantly , people buying cannabis are not going to back - street dealers and so are not being offered harder drugs , unlike in the UK where cannabis is sold by heroin and crack dealers who routinely offer â€œdealsâ€ � on these along with cannabis .
Such an offer led to the recent death of a young man who was given the highly dangerous opioid fentanyl when he went to buy cannabis .
Further proof that decriminalisation works comes from Portugal , where 15 years ago , personal possession of all drugs was decriminalised .
This doesnâ€
™ t mean they are legal ; rather , people caught possessing drugs are subject to civil ( eg fines , community service ) rather than criminal sanctions .
This is proportionate to the harm of drugs because , for most drug users , a criminal record will be more harmful to their life chances than the effects of the drug .
In the UK , we have a million young people with criminal records ( mostly for cannabis possession ) ; that means drug dealing becomes their only realistic work , further fuelling the drugs market .
Moreover , by treating those addicted to drugs humanely rather than imprisoning them , the Portuguese have reduced opioid death numbers to one - third of what they were , whereas in the UK our criminalising approach has increased deaths by 30 % over the same time .
David Nutt is professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London and was chair of the UKâ€ ™ s advisory committee on the misuse of drugs until 2009 .
Alastair Campbell
Though I have had addiction issues , I have never taken illegal drugs and have always hated anything to do with them â€ “ the dealers , the crime networks , the paraphernalia , the effects .
I think that attitude made me very opposed even to the notion of decriminalisation .
It felt to me like rewarding people who didnâ€ ™ t deserve it .
But in recent years , gradually , I have changed my mind .
I remember a few years ago , when I still worked for the government , having a heated argument with Tessa Jowellâ€ ™ s husband David Mills , who was passionately of the view that our way was failing and an open and regulated market , alongside real education of the dangers , was the only way .
I disagreed but he got me thinking .
I then followed the change in Portugal , which did not have the negative impact
I and many others feared .
But the biggest change has come from the work I do campaigning on mental health and the understanding that our hospitals and prisons are full of addicts , many of whom need to be treated as patients , not criminals .
I donâ€
™ t know for sure if decriminalisation is the way to go .
But I know that what we are doing now is not working and at the very least we need to take seriously the possibility that a very different approach is required .
Alastair Campbell was Tony Blairâ€ ™ s director of communications .
He is an ambassador for charities including Mind , Rethink and Alcohol Concern .
Kathy Gyngell Had Prince William asked whether legalising drugs would help addicts quit their addiction , he might have received a different reply .
Addicts in recovery that I have spoken to say that enabling supply , making drugs cheaper and normalising general use by the removal sanctions , is the last thing they or we need .
Their turning point often was arrest and police pushing them , not into prison , but into treatment .
But a propaganda battle has raged in the UK for 25 years or more for legalising drugs , backed by powerful and well - financed legalisation lobbies .
The princeâ€ ™ s
well meaning but naive intervention gives grist to their mill .
Whether you meet an addict , visit a drug - addicted community or encounter the middle - class parents of an irreversibly cannabis - induced psychotic child ,
what is apparent is that it is drug use ( not its prohibition ) that has destroyed their lives , corrupted the community or compromised a childâ€ ™ s mental health .
The truth is our law is liberal , not punitive .
The casualties of drugs are casualties of uninhibited freedom , not of prohibition .
Had the law stepped in , more young men and women would be alive today or have a future worth living .
Any drug liberalisation , whether in the form of decriminalisation or formal legalisation , has the same social effect in that it increases supply and the potential for harm in equal measure , as the experiments in both Colorado and Portugal have now clearly demonstrated .
Nor has crime been eliminated .
Drugs cost money , and addicts always want more .
The demand for a black market remains .
If you believe that the police should hand out free heroin ( at a cost that would eclipse treatment and rehab costs ) to stop crime , know that it wonâ€ ™ t .
Thrice - daily diamorphine prescriptions have failed to keep addicts off street drugs or restore them to full health , and cost the taxpayer .
Drugs are no ordinary commodity .
Some freedoms are not worth defending , unless you are perverse enough to believe that chaining people to dependency sets them free .
Kathy Gyngell is co - editor of The Conservative Woman and a research fellow at the Centre for Policy Studies .
Kehinde Andrews Legalisation of drugs has to be discussed in the context of the racist criminal justice system .
Black people have suffered long enough because of the blanket criminalisation of drugs and heavy - handed enforcement by police and the courts .
Since the 60s , minority communities have been harassed by police for possession of drugs like marijuana .
Drugs were used as a pretext to patrol inner cities , which in turn became a symbol of the fear of the dark , mugging migrants and their descendants , who struck so much fear into the heart of the nation .
Nothing has changed today , with the majority of stop - and - searches being related to drugs .
The same drugs that are seen as such a problem in the inner city , while being perfectly acceptable on university campuses or in the professional classes .
In the ultimate irony , it is an open secret that cocaine use is prevalent in the legal profession , while black people are more likely to be stopped , arrested , charged and receive a custodial sentence for non - violent drug offences .
We can see the effect of this most clearly in the United States , where drug charges are a key factor as to why more than 2 million African Americans make up 34 % of the correctional system population .
However , although Britain imprisons far fewer people than the US , black people are actually more overrepresented in British jails than US ones .
It is perfectly reasonable to ban dangerous drugs , and the disproportionate impact of certain narcotics on minority communities can not be ignored .
But blanket criminalisation , and selective enforcement , is not about public safety .
Over - policing and severe punishment for minor drug offences are used as an attempt to control the apparently deviant minority communities , who can not be trusted to make the â€œcorrect life choicesâ€ � .
Until we accept the racialised nature of drug policy , there can be no sensible debate about legalisation .
Kehinde Andrews is an associate professor in sociology at Birmingham City University .
Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett Itâ€ ™ s patently obvious that , despite decades of prohibition , people are not going to stop taking drugs .
Neither is criminalising and jailing addicts ever likely to make their problems go away
â€ “ if anything , they are going to either compound their addictions while inside or develop new ones .
This is bad news considering that such a high proportion of addicts and prisoners suffer from mental health problems .
When I was younger , a schoolfriendâ€ ™ s dad was jailed for growing weed .
She missed having him around while she was growing up , and for what ?
Iâ€ ™ m pro - legalisation , especially when it comes to cannabis .
Itâ€ ™ s embarrassing how far behind the US
we are on this .
It still feels taboo to advocate the legalisation of weed in certain circles , unless itâ€ ™ s for medicinal use .
My dad has MS and weed helps a lot with his symptoms , so I have seen first - hand how it can be transformative as far as pain relief goes .
But the minute you say you support it for recreational use , too , people get squeamish .
Thereâ€ ™ s this attitude
that itâ€ ™ s fine if youâ€ ™ re ill or disabled , but if you do it for fun , itâ€ ™ s not .
Iâ€ ™ m not ashamed to say that I like to get high .
The TV show Broad City is the first I have really seen where young women enjoy weed and have a great time without it being a big drama .
There are , of course , concerns about cannabis - induced psychosis .
I have friends who have had anxiety and panic attacks from smoking too much .
But to my mind youâ€ ™ re less likely to hide away in your room smoking joint after joint
if itâ€ ™ s more socially acceptable .
Plus being allowed to grow your own grass or being able to actually get decent quality hash might make teenagers â€ “ who seem especially vulnerable â€ “ turn away from stronger strains such as skunk , which currently dominate the market .

2017-09-24,"The prospect of King Charles has given hope to the Australian Republic Movement , with polling showing not even the British are enthused by the heir apparent ascending to the throne .
Polling by FTI Consulting of 2,531 UK citizens on behalf of the Australian movement late last month found more than half of respondents believed the Queen best embodied the spirit of the United Kingdom but just 39 % trusted Prince Charles and only 37 % wanted him to replace his mother .
The Duke of Cambridge , Prince William , who follows his father in the succession line , proved a more popular choice at 41 % , while 7 % wanted another royal family member and 14 % thought the monarchy should not exist .
When it came to who should be a head of state of a country , 46 % strongly agreed it should only be a citizen of that country , while another 33 % slightly agreed with that statement .
The Australian Republic Movement chief , Michael Cooney , said the message was clear â€ “ a King Charles was â€œunpopular and untrusted , even at homeâ€ � .
â€œWhat this really shows is that the question for Australia is not whether we have change , it is what kind of change we have ,
â€ � he said .
â€œAnd the choice is between either King Charles or an Australian , chosen by Australians , to be the head of state.â€ �
Cooney said the decision to poll UK citizens was made because â€œthey have more influence over the result than we [ Australians ] didâ€ � .
He said that , despite the popularity of the new generation of royals , with William , Catherine and Harry helping to reinvigorate interest in the monarchy , Australia would have Charles as its head of state .
â€œThe one thing we know is it is highly predictable and the next king of England and king of Australia is Charles , â€ �
he said .
â€œWe are not going to have William as our next king .
â€œBecoming a republic will not stop them from visiting for things like the Invictus Games , or the Commonwealth Games , or things like that .
But it will mean we have a chance to have our own head of state.â€ �
Cooney said that , particularly in the current Australian political climate of â€œdivisiveness and huge debates about our identityâ€ � , a republic was needed more than ever .
â€œWe need to repair our political system to make it more inclusive and more unifying , â€ � he said .
The republic movement is hoping for a national vote by 2020 asking Australians if they want an Australian head of state and how they would like that person to be chosen , before , if all goes as they plan , proceeding to a referendum by 2022 ."
2017-09-27,"The shadow education secretary , Angela Rayner , has defended the royal family after a fellow Labour MP mocked Prince Harryâ€ ™ s military record and said Prince William should stop receiving public funding .
Emma Dent Coad , whose constituency covers the princesâ€ ™ official residence at Kensington Palace in west London , reportedly questioned Harryâ€ ™ s ability to fly a helicopter during a republican fringe event at the Labour conference .
Speaking at a meeting called Reigning in the Monarchy , Dent Coad was quoted as saying : â€œHarry canâ€ ™ t actually fly a helicopter
â€
¦
He tried to pass the helicopter exam about four times
and he couldnâ€
™ t get through it at all so he always goes for the co - pilot .
So he just sits there going â€˜vroom vroomâ€
™
.â€ �
She added that it was â€œabsolutely
outrageousâ€
� that the taxpayer had to pick up the tab for Â£150 jumpers bought by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge , according to the Times .
In a round of broadcast interviews , Rayner praised the princes but ducked questions about whether Dent Coad should apologise .
She told BBC Breakfast and Sky News that William and Harry had made the royal family â€œtrendy againâ€ � .
â€œThere is a role for them .
They are part of the staple British diet , â€ �
she told BBC Breakfast .
Asked whether Dent Coad should apologise , Rayner told Sky News : â€œEmma has to respond to what her comments are , but Iâ€ ™ m absolutely clear that the monarchy is here and they are going to be around for a long time.â€ �
She also highlighted Harryâ€ ™ s role in organising the Invictus games for wounded armed services personnel .
â€œI think Harryâ€ ™ s been doing a fantastic job , especially with regard to our veterans , â€ �
she told Sky .
Speaking to ITVâ€ ™ s Good Morning Britain , Rayner alluded to the well - known republican stance of the Labour leader , Jeremy Corbyn .
â€œItâ€ ™ s never been a secret that in the Labour party there are people who are anti - royalist , â€ � she said .
But she added : â€œI personally feel the current generation â€ “ Prince Harry , Prince William and Kate â€ “ have done the royal family proud.â€ �
During the election campaign Corbyn denied that Labour would abolish the monarchy .
In a TV hustings event he added that he had a â€œnice chatâ€ � with the Queen .
Coad reportedly said Harry and William were â€œnot very brightâ€ � , adding : â€œJust let them drift away , be playboys or whatever.â€ � John Woodcock , MP for Barrow and Furness , said Dent Coadâ€ ™ s comments did not reflect the view of the party .
Tobias Ellwood , the defence undersecretary and former army captain , suggested Dent Coad should go to the Invictus Games to witness how Harry was inspiring â€œour injured heroesâ€ � .
In all of her interviews Rayner insisted Labour was a â€œgovernment in waitingâ€ � .
On BBC Radio 4â€ ™ s Today programme she ruled out union demands for a 5 % pay rise for public sector workers .
â€œWeâ€ ™ d love to give public sector workers a 5 % pay rise , but we can not do that at the moment .
What weâ€ ™ ve said is that we make sure they will get an inflation pay rise , which is more than what this Conservative government have done ,
â€ � she said .
â€œWe canâ€ ™ t undo the damage that the Conservative have done to our public sector
â€
¦ but what we will do is reverse some of that and start putting us on the right path .
But it will take longer than I would personally like to see ...
we have to be responsible about that and
thatâ€ ™ s what Jeremy Corbyn is going to set out in his speech about responsible government.â€
�
The Daily Telegraph said pre - released remarks from Corbynâ€ ™ s conference speech would raise concerns that he planned to impose a robot tax .
Rayner denied this .
