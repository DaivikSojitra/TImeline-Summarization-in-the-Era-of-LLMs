"Journey of a Lifetime ( 11 am , Radio 4 ) pretty much lives up to its title , as some lucky sod sees the world at the expense of the Royal Geographical Society and the BBC , then makes a programme about it .
In 2004 the cash went to Chris Brown , who wanted to spend six months with yak - herders in northern India .
He would join the Kharnak at their summer home , then accompany them as they crossed the Himalayas to their winter and spring grazing grounds .
Things did n't go entirely to plan .
It was the worst winter for 32 years , Brown says .
"" I spent the majority of the time living with the Rupshu tribe of nomads , waiting and making attempts to get through the snow to the Kharnak .
I made it through in the end , but not without my horse dying , cracking a bone in my hand and the odd interesting encounter with the Indian army .
"" It still sounds more fun than travelling Ryanair .
Elsewhere , impressionists Jon Culshaw , Jan Ravens et al return for another series of Dead Ringers ( 6.30pm , Radio 4 ) .
If that 's whetted your appetite for satire , tune in to Sunday 's War With the Newts ( 8 pm , Radio 3 ) .
Adapted from a 30s story by Karel Capek , it 's a lively attack on totalitarianism and capitalist greed .
With giant amphibians ."
"Picture a younger , taller , prettier Usher , and you 'll understand why the R&amp;B world is Chris Brown 's oyster .
Still too young to buy his own Cristal , the Romeo - in - training is America 's biggest new soul star .
This debut entered the US chart at number one - a rare feat there - and established Brown as serious competition to both Usher and Justin Timberlake .
He owes it to lucky timing , and being the same age as his audience , rather than to genius but few would argue that the crunk - influenced single Run It !
( another US chart - topper ) is n't big and wonderful .
Elsewhere , he 's a deft purveyor of mid - tempo , hip - hop - inspired pop whose lyrics never stray into naughty post - watershed territory .
Love of the puppy variety is Brown 's area of expertise , but there 's a sweetness to his voice that keeps the likes of Young Love from being too sickening .
Promising stuff ."

"What is the key to winning the US Open ?
Chris Brown Southend Tracy Austin
The key to winning any grand slam is to have the skills , technique and mental and physical toughness .
The US Open surface is a leveller because it 's not exceptionally fast or slow , but this tournament can be a little more hectic than the others .
Winning any grand slam is incredibly tough .
What was your secret to being so successful so young ?
Andrea Nelson Norwich
I think I was born with good concentration and mental toughness .
I see how many ups and downs players have and how they lose concentration and I realise how important it was to be able to focus and handle pressure well .
Who is the greatest woman player of all ?
Nathan Macdonald London N1
People ask me that all the time and I really have trouble choosing between Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova .
Steffi has 22 grand slam titles ; Martina has more because of all the doubles and mixed doubles titles she won .
I 'm going to hedge and say they are tied .
What has happened to American women 's tennis ?
Chrissie Houlding Leeds
It 's much the same problem as you have with British tennis .
We have such a big country and so much money that you would think we would come up with packs of players .
I think most of the time it 's about getting the best all - round athletes to choose tennis and stick with it .
Tennis is very difficult .
It 's like playing the piano , you have to start early and work hard over a long period of time .
I think a lot of American kids are just not hungry enough to handle that .
How good do you think Andy Murray is ?
Who does he remind you of at his age ?
Jonathan Casper
Ayr The sky is the limit .
He 's tough , he 's got great talent and he moves with such good balance .
He can hit the ball hard but also shows very soft hands .
He reminds me of Miroslav Mecir ."
"Sunderland officials have launched an internal investigation after three players were alleged to have taken part in a filmed sex session .
Keeper Ben Alnwick , midfielder Liam Lawrence and striker Chris Brown are reported to have appeared in the film with a mystery woman .
The players can expect to be in trouble with chairman Niall Quinn and manager Roy Keane if they are found to have breached the club 's disciplinary rules .
"" The behaviour of any individual that adversely affects the image or good name of Sunderland Football Club is obviously disappointing , "" said Sunderland director Lesley Callaghan .
"" We will be handling this matter internally . ""
Lawrence , 24 , is currently on loan at Stoke with a view to completing a permanent move , while 19-year - old Alnwick has agreed to join Tottenham in a £ 1million switch in January .
Brown , 21 , remains part of Keane 's squad , but has not been involved in the last three games .
Former Sunderland midfielder Martin Woods , 20 , now with Rotherham , is also reported to have been present when the filming took place at a flat ."
"Should West Bromwich Albion miss out on automatic promotion their manager , Tony Mowbray , would need only to look back to this performance to see where it all began to go wrong .
Having dragged themselves back on terms through Zoltan Gera 's 25-yard shot the league leaders squandered a string of chances to take three points and ended up with nothing , even though Preston North End finished with nine men after Youl Mawene , the scorer of the first goal , and Chris Brown were sent off in an action - packed encounter .
"" We played reasonably well but we did n't take our chances and were punished , "" said Mowbray , reflecting on a squandered opportunity to put daylight between themselves and their rivals .
"" We try to make it hard , to stop teams from scoring against us , but it should n't really have mattered because of the number of chances we created .
"" Preston had lost four of their previous five league games but turned the table upside down by taking an early lead , when Mawene leapt to head home his third of the season after a pinpoint corner from Darren Carter .
West Bromwich clearly missed Kevin Phillips , their 17-goal leading scorer , as they struggled to break down North End 's defence in the opening 45 minutes , but it was a different story after the home side 's Simon Whaley had been denied by a post in the dying moments of the half .
Gera , who had sat out the FA Cup win at Peterborough because of suspension , marked his return by equalising and from that moment there seemed only one winner .
The Preston defence found itself under severe pressure as Mowbray 's side piled forward but , just as the game appeared to be heading their way , North End stunned them by taking the lead again , Karl Hawley turning the ball in from close range after more good work by Carter .
The victory took Preston to within a point of Sheffield Wednesday and safety but was marred by the dismissals of Mawene and Brown for second yellows .
The defender was sent off in the 84th minute as the Baggies prepared to take a free - kick outside the area and it left Alan Irvine , the Preston manager , fuming . ""
Youl had been injured and we were trying to get him some treatment but were n't allowed to , "" he said .
"" He was trying to be the ultimate professional and stay on to help us defend a free - kick , but I think the referee saw it as him being deliberately slow leaving the field of play . """
"According to the hype , Chris Brown is the new Michael Jackson - an 18-year - old from the middle of nowhere ( tiny Tappahannock , Virginia ) who sings , dances , writes and produces .
He even helps direct his own videos .
His two albums - 2005 's self - titled debut and last year 's Exclusive - are full of state - of - the - art , hip - hop influenced R&amp;B. Songs like Run It ! and Wall to Wall should give Usher a reason to look over his shoulder , but on this evidence , Brown is some way short of being the self - styled "" Prince of Pop "" ; instead , he is just an average dancer , and a singer who frequently ca n't be bothered to sing .
Brown would surely be embarrassed if he was not so self - satisfied .
The choruses of the songs his fans have come to hear him sing are all on tape - during Say Goodbye and Wall to Wall , he does n't even bother pretending , the microphone rarely anywhere near his mouth while the lyrics continue to pour from the speakers .
He dances , pretty badly , to Umbrella by his rumoured girlfriend / fiancee Rihanna , and even , mind - bogglingly , to Vanilla Ice 's Ice Ice Baby .
He brings two female fans up on stage for current hit With You , but instead of singing the love song for them , he manages to completely ignore both women even while draping himself around their shoulders , as if scanning the room for someone more exciting .
Brown 's fans - many of them no older than the star - have a right to expect more than this sort of shambolic karaoke , yet screams of uncritical delight greet his every pelvic gyration and stumbling soft - shoe shimmy .
They seem content to simply be breathing the same air for an hour , rather than demanding that Brown does something worthy of their adulation ."
"Despite three previous albums each shifting half a million copies , Lemar seems to exist somewhere below the mainstream pop radar , which does something of a disservice to his talents .
On this new collection he 's at his best when , as on lead single ' If She Knew ' , he grasps the electronic R&amp;B coat tails of US stars like Ne - Yo and Chris Brown . '
The Reason ' proves to be an enjoyably addictive listen ."
"Just when you thought American R&amp;B stars could n't get any smaller , younger or cuter , along comes Chris Brown .
Already a US entertainment phenomenon , lately the 19-year - old has been proving that there is more to him than being a nice singer with goofy teeth .
Fractionally more saucy material , the power - sharing collaborations with T - Pain ; even if there 's no urge for Chris to go "" mature "" too early , his material has reflected the changing concerns of his audience .
At the moment , it 's probably best to think of him as graduating high school : yearning for something more edgy ( the Lil ' Wayne remix ) , but still doing what he 's told ( recent single Forever .
What was that ?
Europop ? ) .
Undoubtedly , the more credible college dropout years are yet to come .

"The "" Prince of R&amp;B "" - as 19-year - old Chris Brown is being ambitiously styled - is n't all that dissimilar from fellow princes Ne - Yo and Akon .
He has the gym - chiselled body , honey - drenched voice and eye for a financial opportunity ( acolytes were offered the chance to pay Â£100 to attend a pre - show party tonight , in addition to the Â£40 they had already coughed up for the gig ) .
But what sets the Virginia - born Brown apart is a boy - next - door mildness that ensured his tweeny fans would leave the show uncorrupted , if lighter of purse .
Not for Brown the earthiness of his rivals .
If he has a raw , visceral side , he must save it for his pop star girlfriend , Rihanna .
What the paying public get is a young showman who , despite displays of bare pecs and shout - outs to the ladies , would struggle to offend the most Victorian vicar .
As the focal point of a troupe of dancers , DJs and drummers , he has a good bit of responsibility heaped on his beefed - up shoulders , but Brown rises to it unflaggingly - singing , executing backflips , balancing on a wobbly levitating stage at the back of the arena .
He even pretends to answer a ringing phone in the red London phone box that has incongruous pride of place in the middle of the stage .
If only he were sexy on top of everything else , it might prove too much for the heart - both his and mine .
The music , however , is forgettable : fleshed out by taped backing vocals , he trots out the hits Kiss Kiss , Run It and the recently ubiquitous duet with Jordin Sparks , No Air
( Sparks is n't with us tonight , but her recorded voice is ) .
It 's the special effects and frenetic energy , rather than the songs , that drive the show .
An invigorating but oddly faceless evening - something Brown will have to work on in 2009 ."
"Singer Chris Brown has handed himself in to Los Angeles police over an alleged assault on an unidentified woman believed to be his girlfriend , the pop star Rihanna .
The couple were due to perform at the Grammy awards last night but they pulled out after Brown , 19 , was accused of attacking a woman after an argument in a car .
Police have not named the woman involved in the incident , reported to have suffered "" visible injuries "" , but the Los Angeles Times reports witnesses claiming that the woman was Rihanna .
The Los Angeles Times goes on to report that Brown and the unidentified woman were involved in an argument on Sunday evening in Hancock Park , Los Angeles , which escalated to the extent that the police were called .
Brown voluntarily attended Wiltshire Division police station later that day .
"" The exact charge was criminal threats and it is going to be a criminal threats investigation , "" said Sgt Bridget Pickett .
"" There may be domestic violence charges added later , but that will be up to the district attorney 's office . ""
Rihanna , who won a Grammy award in 2007 for her hit single Umbrella , had been due to perform alongside Justin Timberlake at last night 's award , while Brown was scheduled to perform his song Forever .
Event organisers apologised for Rihanna 's absence , while Al Green performed in her place .
Publicists for both singers have yet to release a statement concerning the incident ."
"Police sources have told the LA Times that pop singer Rihanna was the victim of her boyfriend Chris Brown 's alleged assault on Sunday night .
Both singers cancelled their appearance at the Grammy awards , after Brown had voluntarily reported to Los Angeles police .
According to the LA Times , the pop star 's real name â€ “ Robyn Fenty â€ “ is listed on the police report .
Brown , 19 , has been charged with "" criminal threats "" and was released on $ 50,000 bail .
Additional charges may yet be filed .
The charges stem from an incident that occurred on Sunday morning , when police were called to a vehicle parked in the Los Angeles Hancock Park neighbourhood .
Though Brown was not at the scene , the victim is believed to have visible facial injuries , including a bloody nose , as well as bite marks on her arms .
She identified Brown as the attacker .
The night before the assault , Rihanna and Chris Brown had been photographed together at a party for music industry mogul Clive Davis .
According to TMZ , the police report quotes penal code section 245 â€ “ assault with a deadly weapon â€ “ but there was allegedly no weapon at the scene .
The charge may instead be linked to Brown 's martial arts knowledge .
Rihanna 's publicist has not yet confirmed the reports , saying just that Rihanna is "" well "" and expressing thanks for journalists ' concern .
Brown has meanwhile hired lawyer Mark Geragos , who defended Michael Jackson in his child molestation trial .
One of Chris Brown 's sponsors , Wrigley Gum , has already suspended his Doublemint campaign , saying that they are "" concerned by the serious allegations made against Chris Brown "" .
A 2007 interview has also been uncovered , where Brown described to Giant magazine the physical abuse he suffered as a child . ""
[ My stepfather ] used to hit my mom , "" Brown told the magazine .
"" I remember ... crying and thinking , ' I 'm just gon na go crazy on him one day . '
"" Brown is due back in court on 5 March"
"Rihanna has cancelled a concert in Jakarta , following an alleged assault case involving her boyfriend Chris Brown .
The star was due to play the Indonesian capital on Thursday night .
It is Rihanna 's third cancelled appearance since the alleged assault on Sunday , the other cancelled dates being the Grammys and a Malaysian show earlier in the week .
Brown has been released on $ 50,000 bail after being charged with making a criminal threat .
Police were called to the LA suburb of Hancock Park in the early hours of Sunday , after a witness reported hearing a woman screaming on the street .
The identity of the woman â€ “ who suffered visible facial injuries and identified Brown as her attacker â€ “ has not been made public .
However , police sources have told the LA Times that Rihanna 's real name , Robyn Fenty , is listed on the crime report .
The LAPD are still investigating the case , and it is possible Brown could be charged with a more serious domestic violence case ."
"' Domestic violence ... affected me , especially towards women , I treat them differently .
Because I do n't want to go through the same thing or put a woman through the same thing that that person put my mom through . ""
Thus spoke R&amp;B singer Chris Brown when he appeared on The Tyra Banks Show in 2007 , discussing the abuse his family allegedly suffered at the hands of his stepfather .
Two years later , Brown , still just 19 years old , marched himself into a Los Angeles police station .
He had allegedly beaten up his girlfriend , fellow singer Rihanna , so badly that , according to reports in the US press , she has "" horrific "" facial injuries and bite marks on her arms .
The two had been due to perform at the Grammy awards .
Instead , Rihanna went to hospital ( she has since left ) and cancelled her upcoming tour .
Brown has hired the lawyer Mark Geragos , best known for defending Michael Jackson against charges of child abuse .
The internet , of course , has gone to town on this story , with the celebrity gossip websites competing for who can posit the most tasteless - and irrelevant - theory about what prompted the alleged attack , and who can get the most invasive video of Brown or Rihanna since it happened .
Other more serious websites are attempting to fashion Rihanna into a tragic female icon , while simultaneously berating her about rumours that she may not press charges against her boyfriend .
It 's hard to think how one can worsen a situation where a woman is said to have been so badly beaten by her partner , yet the internet has managed to do just that , and one can only feel enormous sympathy for Rihanna for not only going through this but having to do so in such a public fashion .
One also , to a certain extent , feels sympathy for Brown , who clearly has some very sad issues to deal with himself .
Given that this is a very personal tragedy , involving two young lives , it might seem irrelevant to ask how it will affect their careers .
Comments from people such as Tracy Ford , editor of hip - hop website TheBoombox.com , certainly spark that response , though , including his reported suggestion to Yahoo !
news that this incident "" might actually help Rihanna ...
She 's definitely being viewed as the victim at this point . ""
Good career move , babe !
But in regards to Brown , the question has wider interest : is being accused of spousal abuse actually detrimental to a man 's career ?
He has already suffered some professional setbacks , with Wrigley chewing gum dropping him from its campaign .
Will his brand be dented further ?
Looking at other men in the public eye who have been accused of offences against women , the truth is that , in the long run , it probably does no more , or even less , damage to their careers than if they were caught with drugs - a point that swimmer Michael Phelps , who has just been suspended for three months after being photographed smoking the decidedly non - performance - enhancing drug cannabis , might ruefully note .
For instance , the actor Josh Brolin 's late career bloom was apparently unimpeded by an incident in 2004 when he was arrested at 3 am after his wife , actress Diane Lane , called the police , claiming that he was attacking her .
She later declined to press charges .
Similarly , there have been flutters around Sean Connery 's oft - repeated claims that "" it 's not that bad "" to hit women (
"" If you 've tried everything else ... then I think it 's absolutely right , "" he elaborated in an interview with Barbara Walters ) .
But Connery is still a much - beloved actor , who regularly gets described as a "" national treasure "" .
The sporting industry has a long history of ignoring the black eyes and broken arms of athletes ' wives and girlfriends .
Yes , Paul Gascoigne was vilified after blacking the eyes , bruising the face and dislocating the fingers of his then wife , as was Stan Collymore after punching his then girlfriend Ulrika Jonsson in the face .
Yet both continued to have sporting and TV careers and the only reason Gascoigne 's football career ended was due to his own deteriorating physicality , as opposed to that of his battered wife , Sheryl .
This has become such a problem in US sports that the feminist website jezebel.com recently posted an article despairing of how the National Football League 's two most celebrated players , Larry Fitzgerald and Santonio Holmes , have been accused of extremely violent domestic assaults , but no one in the American press is talking about it .
Fitzgerald 's former partner once filed for a protection order stating that he hit her head against a marble floor and she lost "" chunks of her hair "" in the assault .
As for Holmes , in 2006 he was accused of "" choking [ his girlfriend ] , throwing her into the ground and slamming her into a door "" .
The charges were dropped and Holmes went to a treatment centre .
But perhaps the most unexpected instances of forgiveness come when famous men are accused of involvement with young girls , as evidenced by the world 's apparent amnesia about Bill Wyman 's past , a man who started dating 13-year - old Mandy Smith when he was 47 ( they eventually married ) .
Roman Polanski may have been exiled by America but accusations that he drugged and had sex with a 13-year - old girl have never really bothered his adopted home of France and he has been enjoying a veritable career renaissance of late - not that he ever stopped working anyway .
Then there 's the R&amp;B singer R Kelly , who has a truly remarkable tendency to respond to all manner of charges against him via his album titles and song lyrics .
There were the long - running rumours that he married fellow singer Aaliyah when he was 27
and she was an inconveniently underage 15 .
Both denied this although they did n't exactly help themselves by titling her debut album - which they worked on together
- Age Ai n't
Nothing But a Number .
He has repeatedly faced charges for possession of child pornography , and the parents of a 14-year - old girl accused him of raping their daughter , urinating on her and videotaping it .
His response was to release a single that included the memorable line , "" So shower down on me , wet me with your love . ""
As this paper 's Alexis Petridis wrote in 2007 in a review of Kelly 's album , Double Up , "" Anyone else pleading not guilty to 14 sex crimes might think twice about presenting themselves as a ' freak ' enchained by their own insatiable desires . ""
After six years , those charges were dropped .
It seems almost superfluous to chuck in at this point that Kelly was also served with an emergency protective order by his then wife in 2006 .
He is currently one of the most successful R&amp;B singers in the world .
One could point out that quite a few of the charges listed above were later dropped .
Yet compare the fates of these men with the way that Michael Jackson 's career has gone into freefall since he was first accused of child sex abuse against a boy in 1993 , even though he was never actually charged in this initial case .
Kelly , on the other hand , continues to work with Beyonce , Jay - Z and Kanye West .
In a strange way , it seems that women might be the unwitting victims of the media 's homophobia : a man and a little boy - well ,
that 's just disgusting ; a man and a little girl - well , at least you can see where the dude was coming from .
Anyone who hurts another person , particularly someone physically weaker than them , is an abuser and everyone - the media , fans , even football coaches - knows this .
But sometimes , particularly when huge sums of money are at stake , this seems an inconvenient truth .
Only time will tell how much the public and record company think Rihanna 's facial injuries are worth ."
"Chris Brown is "" sorry and saddened "" over his alleged assault of the singer Rihanna , he said yesterday .
His written statement arrived one week after the apparent altercation and was the first official release from either party .
Brown 's comments confirmed none of the allegations and remained vague over what took place in the early hours of Sunday 8 February .
"" Words can not begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired , "" he said simply .
"" I am seeking the counselling of my pastor , my mother and other loved ones , and I am committed , with God 's help , to emerging a better person . ""
The alleged altercation took place shortly after midnight on 8 February .
Police were called to a dispute in Los Angeles 's Hancock Park neighbourhood , where a couple had been fighting in a rented Lamborghini .
The female victim â€ “ identified in numerous reports as Rihanna â€ “ received hospital treatment for her injuries .
Chris Brown , Rihanna 's boyfriend and also a singer , voluntarily surrendered himself to police later that day .
Brown was released on $ 50,000 bail and will appear in court on 5 March if authorities press formal charges .
"" Much of what has been speculated or reported on blogs and/or reported in the media is wrong , "" Brown 's statement continued . ""
While I would like to be able to talk about this more , until the legal issues are resolved , this is all I can say , except that I have not written any messages or made any posts to Facebook , on blogs or any place else .
Those posts or writings under my name are frauds .
"" The statement was released by a public relations company specialising in crisis management , according to the New York Times .
"" You think you know somebody , but you really do n't , "" Rihanna 's father , Ronald Fenty , told People magazine this weekend .
"" At some point , she will speak out .
I hope she will stand up for women all over the world . ""
The Umbrella singer is currently residing in her native Barbados .
Despite the serious allegations , some of Chris Brown 's peers have spoken out in his support . ""
Ca n't we give [ him ] a break ? ""
asked Kanye West on Friday , at a recording of VH1 's Storytellers ."
"A photograph appearing to show R&amp;B singer Rihanna with a bruised and bloodied face has been leaked online .
The picture of the 21-year - old is reported to have been taken after she suffered an alleged assault at the hands of her boyfriend , the R&amp;B singer Chris Brown , earlier this month .
The picture , said to be evidence in the investigation into the assault , appeared on the American gossip site TMZ yesterday and the Los Angeles Police Department responded last night . ""
The Los Angeles Police Department takes seriously its duty to maintain the confidentiality of victims of domestic violence , "" the statement read . ""
The Department launched an immediate internal investigation and subsequently filed a personnel complaint .
A violation of this type is considered serious misconduct , with penalties up to and including termination . ""
Rihanna , real name Robyn Fenty , is widely believed to be the woman at the centre of a police investigation into an assault that took place in Hancock Park , LA , on 8 February .
The singer 's boyfriend Chris Brown handed himself into police the following day and was released on $ 50,000 ( roughly £ 35,000 ) bail .
He has subsequently released a statement regarding the incident : "" Words can not begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired .
"" The statement also said that many rumours regarding the incident were false .
Neither party has confirmed that Rihanna is the woman who was assaulted , however , the LA Times reported last week that it was the Umbrella singer 's name on the police report .
The LAPD investigation into the incident continues ."
"Three days ago , she was performing in front of more than 20,000 Chris Brown fans at the O2 Arena ; tonight , she 's singing in a London pub , both floors of which could comfortably fit on to the O2 stage .
Yet as she and her acoustic guitarist and bass player wriggle through the crowd and set up in the space in front of the pub 's DJ booth , 23-year - old Zarif Davidson confesses that she 's got a bad case of nerves . ""
The main difference is that in the big venues you ca n't see people 's faces , "" she says , analysing the two contrasting gigs a few days later .
"" You can hear them , you can feel them , you know there 's something there .
But you ca n't see whether people are smiling , or bored , or dancing , or laughing -
you just do n't know , so you 've got to keep going .
Whereas in the smaller gigs , you 're more at the mercy of the audience , because if they do n't like something , you can see them switch off .
"" It may be surprising to hear someone in Zarif 's position speaking of live work with such nuanced enthusiasm .
A pop artist signed to a major label , whose debut single is only now being touted round Britain 's radio stations , she has nevertheless done more than her share of road work , honing her craft in pub back rooms - the supposed preserve of indie bands and other "" serious "" musicians who earn the right to an audience through old - fashioned slog .
The mechanics may be changing - MySpace pages replacing demo tapes , music sold independently online - but the Transit van trawl around the toilet circuit remains a cornerstone rite of passage for aspirant rock stars , and audiences are taught to mistrust anyone who has n't paid these dues .
Yet there is a parallel world standing in the shadows of the established indie / rock treadmill : a very different live music circuit where someone whose sound is rooted in soul and R&amp;B , and who counts Madonna , Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder as key influences , can put in the time they need to develop their talents .
It exists just outside the view of the media , but it 's easy enough to find if you know where to look , or who to ask . ""
A lot of band nights tend to be rock and indie , and I always knew I 'd probably get laughed off the stage if I performed at them , "" Zarif says .
"" You 've got to be a certain way , have a certain look and a certain sound , and that 's it .
I find that quite close - minded . ""
Fortunately , the resourceful Londoner managed to snag an introduction to one of the country 's best - kept musical secrets : an informal network of London soul singer - songwriter open mic nights which has helped nurture the careers of hitmakers including Amy Winehouse , Corinne Bailey Rae and Estelle .
"" It 's really all just word - of - mouth , "" Zarif says of the scene that helped her develop .
"" I found out about it by meeting musicians through friends , and then they 'd say , ' I 'm doing this night , ' or ' I 'm doing that night . '
I do n't think I 've ever seen an advert or a poster .
There are lots of flyers going round , but they 've always been handed to me : you do n't really see piles of them in record shops . ""
Tonight 's example , it turns out , is fairly typical .
There 's little in the way of promotion , even inside the venue ; no written mention of the names of the singer / songwriters who troop up to the microphone for their 20-minute sets .
The pub itself , Monkeychews in Chalk Farm , considers itself so far off the beaten track that its website carries the slogan : "" Seek and ye shall find . ""
Yet the audience - in the main , performers and their friends - pay polite , careful attention , and the atmosphere is enthusiastic and supportive .
But this is n't the only way the open - mic circuit works .
At the more elaborate end of the scale are nights like the occasional Kindred Spirit , run by soul singer and songwriting coach Michelle Escoffery .
Styled along similar lines to wildly successful singer - songwriter clubs that have long existed in New York , Kindred Spirit was both where Zarif found her feet as a singer - songwriter , and where she was discovered .
"" They have a house band , and once they agree to let you play , you send them a demo of the songs you 're going to sing and they learn your stuff in advance , "" Zarif says .
"" You go and have a short rehearsal with them , then get up on stage on the night .
It 's still a bit thrown - together , because they 're interpreting your songs in 10 minutes of rehearsal time , but it gives you a chance to do things you ca n't do on your own .
You can send them a demo that 's just you with a guitar in your bedroom , and they 'll build the song up for you ; the musicians make their own parts and the backing singers might come up with a quick vocal line .
"" I thought it would be really intimidating , "" she says , "" because when I first went I was so intimidated just by the people on stage : I was just blown away by the quality of the singers .
But in fact it 's such a warm audience - people really sit and listen to you , and listen to your lyrics and writing as well as to your performance .
It 's scary , but it 's really good fun because you have to prove yourself . ""
The daughter of a Scottish father and an Iranian - Jewish mother , Zarif had performed in funk and rock bands and had started to get work as a session singer , but while studying for a human sciences degree she suffered a bout of pneumonia and lost her voice for six months .
Unable to perform , she devoted her energies to writing .
( She had written her first song as a pre - teen as an entry to a Blue Peter competition . )
When the voice finally returned , it was through , first , appearances at acoustic jazz nights , then sets on the soul open - mic circuit , that she managed to restore her confidence in her ability to sing ; the advice and criticisms she received from fellow writers helped her mature as a songsmith .
By the time she was spotted by a talent scout from Sony , she had built up the catalogue of soul - rooted pop songs that form the basis of her debut album , finished last year but not due for release until this summer .
The delay may help Zarif carve out her own niche in a world heavily populated by British female soul singers with a retro hue to their work .
She is resigned to a certain amount of pigeonholing , but one of the things that sets her apart from the Amys , Duffys and Adeles is her embrace of more modern production styles .
While her records include electronic elements , samples and often lavish instrumentation - Let Me Back , her debut single , recalls Young - Holt Unlimited 's Soulful Strut ; Box of Secrets is a vaudevillian big band extravaganza ; Over is a meticulously arranged break - up song with Lauryn Hill - like husky vocal flourishes - the key for Davidson is in the writing .
And it is the stress put on writing that most sets the soul open - mic circuit apart from its rock equivalents .
"" I 'm someone who 's all about the song , "" Zarif says .
"" I definitely consider myself a songwriter before I think of myself as a singer .
And I 'm a firm believer that if something can work on an acoustic guitar , then it 's gon na be a good song .
I think you get a more honest response when the first time somebody hears a song , it 's completely stripped down .
With production , a song that 's pretty shit can sound amazing , but the songs I come back to again and again are the ones that are just great songs . ""
Zarif is on her way now : there will be more of the bigger gigs and supporting slots to pop idols , with PAs for radio stations and festival appearances all part of what will follow .
But she intends to keep herself grounded in the scene that helped her find her feet .
"" I would certainly miss it if I did n't do the more intimate things , "" she says .
"" If you did n't have a way to test out new songs , to get an honest response , it 'd be easy to disappear up your own arse .
When I 've just written a new song I love it , but there 've been times when you play it at one of these nights and people seem a bit nonplussed , or say they prefer other ones .
That makes you go home and think , ' What was missing ?
What can I do better ? '
"" • Zarif 's debut single , Let Me Back , is released by Sony in April ."
"American music star Rihanna finally broke her silence yesterday about the alleged beating she received at the hands of Chris Brown , her singer boyfriend .
It was the first public statement from the stricken celebrity , whose bruised face has been plastered over American tabloids .
The incident allegedly happened the night before the two artists were to perform at the Grammy awards on 8 February .
Since then Rihanna , whose songs include the worldwide smash hit "" Umbrella "" , has been in seclusion recovering but has surfaced with a brief acknowledgment to thank her fans . ""
[ Rihanna ] wants to assure her fans that she remains strong , is doing well , and deeply appreciates the outpouring of support she has received during this difficult time , "" the statement released through her publicist said .
The brief note did not shed any light on what transpired with Brown , which is the subject of a police investigation .
"" At the request of the authorities , Rihanna is not commenting about the incident involving Chris Brown , "" the statement added .
The singer 's silence , however , has not extended to her relatives , especially since the photograph of her injuries was leaked on to the internet via celebrity website TMZ .
The photograph is apparently a police evidence shot and the Los Angeles Police Department has launched an investigation into how it was released to the media .
The shot shows Rihanna with her eyes swollen and closed , a cut with dried blood on her mouth and bruises around her face .
Her nose is also apparently swollen and discoloured .
Rihanna 's father , Ronald Fenty , has spoken to Usmagazine.com of his anger at the photograph , but also at his relief that it showed the seriousness of the apparent attack .
"" It 's good and bad to see the picture because there are other people who were thinking [ her injuries ] might not be that bad , just a little spank or something , "" he said .
Certainly public reaction to the photo has reflected a mounting anger towards Brown , 19 , who has also fled into hiding away from an obsessed media .
He has been charged so far with making criminal threats , but could face additional charges as the police probe deepens .
He is currently free on $ 50,000 bail .
The incident is believed to have stemmed from an argument between the couple in Los Angeles ' upmarket Hancock Park neighbourhood .
They were seen arguing near their rented Lamborghini after a pre - Grammy party they had both attended .
A verbal spat then allegedly escalated into a physical fight and police were called .
US tabloids have reported that Rihanna can be heard screaming in the background of an emergency phone call made to police .
Officers who arrived found Rihanna bloodied and bruised while Brown had left the scene .
He later turned himself into police after it was announced that he was being sought by authorities as part of the investigation .
Rihanna is one of the hottest properties on the American music scene .
Born in Barbados , she has taken the US by storm and is the first Barbadian to win a Grammy award .
She broke into the business with the release of her album Music of the Sun in 2005 .
But her fame skyrocketed with the album Good Girl Gone Bad in 2007 , which included "" Umbrella "" and eight other popular singles .
Brown has also been a musical success .
He has sold millions of records and has been a quickly rising star with a popularity based to a large degree on his clean - cut image .
That is unlikely to survive a huge public backlash .
Not surprisingly , he has sought to limit the damage as much as possible , though it will not be easy .
He was scheduled to appear on children 's TV show Sesame Street , but that has now been pulled from broadcast .
In a statement released last week , Brown said the incident had been exaggerated in the media . ""
Much of what has been speculated or reported on blogs and/or in the media is wrong , "" he said .
However , he did acknowledge the seriousness of the incident with a grovelling apology for his actions and a claim to be seeking advice .
"" Words can not begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired .
I am seeking the counselling of my pastor , my mother and other loved ones
and I am committed , with God 's help , to emerging a better person , "" he said .
Whether that will be enough to rescue his career is another matter .
In the past fortnight Rihanna 's album sales have soared while Brown 's have sunk ."
"Last week the popular gossip site TMZ.com capped off two weeks of baseless , sensational conjecture and assumptions by publishing a photograph of pop star Rihanna 's bruised and bloody face following an alleged attack by R&amp;B artist Chris Brown .
The Los Angeles police department has been tight - lipped since the initial reports that Brown had been arrested on the night of the Grammy awards , the biggest night of the American music recording industry .
In the absence of any credible information , people made up their own , relying on what appears to be widely held myths about domestic violence .
Because Rihanna and Brown are celebrities , we 've wasted no time turning the entire case into an exploitive mockery resembling a sporting match where people declare allegiances based on which artist they 've downloaded most onto their iPods â€ “ Team Chris v Team Rihanna .
Some went as far as to design their own T - shirts declaring : "" Rihanna deserved it . ""
YouTube parodies are already cropping up .
Some of the discussions make you wonder if all of the public - education funding in the world will be able to combat this massive display of collective ignorance and lack of compassion .
If there is a silver lining to the dark cloud of delusion that has been gathering in mainstream media and online , it 's that now we have definitive proof of what people do n't know .
Major media outlets spent days trying to ponder what possibly could have "" caused "" Brown to allegedly attack Rihanna .
After all , he had such a "" clean cut "" , "" squeaky clean "" image .
The most egregious media platforms crossed the line from victim blaming right into victim defaming , with music network MTV leading the way .
With one hand they published rumours that the provocation of the attack was a communicable disease and on the other hand they ran a television special on dating violence and lamented that some of their female posters appear to be blaming Rihanna for the attack : "" Based on comments MTV News has received on the incident , a surprising number of people â€ “ some of whom are apparently female , although screen names often are n't gender - specific â€ “ are blaming Rihanna for the alleged incident . ""
Since everyone is engaged in drawing conclusions without any supportive facts , here are a few of my own .
Its a myth that a man can be too clean cut to be violent and if he did get violent some external force ( ie Rihanna ) must have triggered it .
Not every act of violence is based on an uncontrollable impulse , nor is abusing women necessarily an aberration .
Anyone can be a batterer .
There is n't a profile for how a batterer looks .
Domestic violence cuts across all races , classes , and socio economic background .
You ca n't look at someone and determine whether or not they are abusive .
It is a myth that a woman is responsible for her own beating .
Experts attribute battering to internal psychological struggles within the batterer .
Some batter for power or control .
Some batter as a result of alcohol or drug abuse .
Others , because they are modelling behaviour they learned as children .
Some batter , ironically , because they are dependent on their victim .
The reasons vary , but none are an excuse .
It is a myth that any physical damage short of death is inconsequential .
Anytime a human being touches another without their permission , it matters .
When they leave behind bloodied , swollen lips , bruises and knots indicating blows to the head , that 's serious .
Each year women in the US experience 4.8 million physical assaults and rapes from their partners ( pdf ) .
While both men and women can be the victims of intimate partner violence , generally speaking , men and women are not equally matched in a physical confrontation .
Irrespective of who initiates the violence , women are seven to 10 times more likely to be injured .
Of the 1,500 people who were killed in the US by their partners in 2004 , 75 % of the victims were women .
This is also the point where I am supposed to tell you that according to the Centres for Disease Control , one in five high school girls in the US reports being the victim of dating violence .
As a result of this violence , teens are more likely to be injured , go to the hospital and engage in risky behaviour such and drinking , drug use and suicide that lead to teen pregnancies and STDs .
Rattling off a string of statistics is useful when attempting to obtain funding or legislation , but not necessarily compelling when battling attitudes about violence in our culture .
As irritating as I may find the coverage and the comments , they are instructive because they may help advocates sharpen their focus .
People have the right to wallow in their own ignorance , but those acting on the erroneous belief that they are entitled to brutalise the body of another human being for whatever reason should be punished .
While we wait for the effort aimed at education and prevention to take root , we still have to rely on the law for protection .
Individual value systems vary when it comes to physically attacking another human being , but the laws in most states do not .
Discussions are necessary , but so are prosecutions ."
"Kanye West lashed out at Radiohead and rallied behind Chris Brown at the taping of a recent TV special , according to reports .
Not that anyone will see it .
Both quotes were excised from Kanye West 's profile on VH1 Storytellers , with producers blaming time constraints .
They cut the three - hour taping into a 90-minute special â€ “ still a full half - hour longer than regular episodes .
But despite the temporal leniency , some of West 's juiciest comments did n't make the cut . ""
Ca n't we give Chris [ Brown ] a break ? ""
the rapper allegedly said .
"" I know I make mistakes in life . ""
The taping took place on 13 February , before many details of Brown 's alleged assault of his girlfriend , Rihanna , had been released .
VH1 encourages artists "" to just keep talking "" , according to executive producer Bill Flanagan .
Producers then promise to "" eliminate any ' gotcha ' moments "" .
But Kanye 's comments were n't cut due to content , Flanagan insisted .
The problem was time .
"" A lot of the stories that Kanye told went long ...
I tried to get to the essence of his comments . ""
Elsewhere on the cutting - room floor , Kanye allegedly complained that he had been snubbed by Radiohead 's Thom Yorke at this year 's Grammy awards . ""
So when he performed at the Grammys , I sat the fuck down , "" he explained .
In comments that did make it to air , Kanye praised a litany of notorious celebs . ""
Michael Jackson , amazing , "" he said .
"" Michael Phelps , amazing ...
OJ Simpson , amazing .
Is he not ?
What he did , when he did , what he did .
Was he not amazing though ? ""
Thank goodness all of these comments , controversial and not so controversial , expurgated and unexpurgated , were leaked to the press ."
"US singer Chris Brown has been charged with two felonies stemming from an argument with his girlfriend , pop star Rihanna , court documents show .
Brown is expected to be arraigned this afternoon on charges of assault likely to cause great bodily injury and making criminal threats .
The 19-year - old R&amp;B singer remains free on $ 50,000 ( Â£35,000 ) bail .
The felony complaint handed down in court this morning identifies Brown 's alleged victim only as "" Robyn F "" .
Rihanna 's real name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty .
If convicted , the possible sentence ranges anywhere from probation to four years and eight months in state prison , said district attorney 's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons .
Los Angeles police arrested Brown on 8 February and booked him on suspicion of making criminal threats .
Police said at the time a woman identified Brown as her attacker during an early morning dispute in an upscale Los Angeles neighbourhood .
Phone messages left for Brown 's attorney and publicist were not immediately returned today .
Brown issued a statement a week after the incident saying that he was "" sorry and saddened "" about the incident .
Rihanna also later issued a statement , saying she would n't comment on the alleged beating at the request of authorities .
She thanked fans for their support .
Brown 's arrest has been a dent in the Run
It !
singer 's squeaky - clean image , and compelled sponsors to drop him or not renew his deals .
The alleged attack also came hours before the couple were scheduled to appear and perform at the ceremony for the Grammy Awards .
Both were no - shows for event ."
"Rihanna fans have started an online petition discouraging the singer from getting back with boyfriend Chris Brown , after it was reported she will not press charges or testify against the R&amp;B star following an alleged assault last month .
The website Do n't Do It
Rihanna has attracted around 1,000 signatures so far , spurred by a photo leaked online that supposedly pictured Rihanna following the assault .
Rihanna has allegedly told police she will not press charges or testify against Brown .
Prosecutors must decide whether to proceed in the case without her support .
Rihanna , 21 , and Brown , 19 , reconciled this weekend at the Miami home of producer Sean "" Diddy "" Combs , according to reports .
They flew back to LA on Monday and checked in together at the Beverly Wilshire Beverly Hills hotel .
Brown is expected to appear in court today , although no formal charges have yet been filed .
According to Californian law , prosecutors may charge an individual with domestic violence even without the victim 's cooperation .
On 8 February , police were called to a Los Angeles neighbourhood where the couple had been arguing .
Brown had allegedly assaulted Rihanna , leaving her with minor injuries .
Both stars cancelled their appearances at the Grammy awards and Rihanna left the country , travelling to her native Barbados .
The police file , including photographs , witness accounts and Rihanna 's original statement , has been passed to the Los Angeles County District Attorney 's office for consideration ."
"Rihanna may testify against boyfriend Chris Brown on charges that he assaulted her last month , according to her lawyer .
Brown , 19 , faces up to four years in prison for an alleged altercation with Rihanna on the night of the Grammys . ""
[ Rihanna ] is planning to do everything that the law requires her to do , "" her lawyer Donald Etra told reporters .
"" If she is required to testify , she will do so . ""
Though Rihanna chose not to press charges against Brown for the incident on 8 February , Los Angeles prosecutors went forward last week with two felony charges â€ “ assault likely to cause great bodily injury and making criminal threats .
Though Rihanna was not present at the arraignment , Etra did not pursue a "" no contact "" order against Brown .
The couple are rumoured to have reconciled .
Rihanna wants a "" quick and expeditious "" legal process , Etra said .
"" She wants to get back to her life and her career . ""
Documents in the court case showed that Rihanna and Brown 's row began with a text message Brown received from another woman .
He then allegedly tried to force Rihanna from their rented sports car , shoving her head against the passenger window and punching her in the face .
Brown has said that he is "" sorry and saddened "" over the incident ."
"The TV network Nickelodeon is under mounting pressure to drop the R&amp;B star Chris Brown from its music awards aimed at children later this month .
More than 10,000 people have signed an online petition excoriating the children 's network for refusing to eject Brown from the awards despite the fact that he has been charged with assault likely to cause bodily injury and making criminal threats .
The charges relate to an incident on 8 February in which he is alleged to have attacked his girlfriend , the singer Rihanna .
Brown appeared in court in Los Angeles last week to hear the charges .
The court was shown pictures of Rihanna with bruises on her face and heard that Brown , 19 , had hit her repeatedly in the face , splattering blood in their limousine .
He is alleged to have threatened to kill her following an argument between the couple sparked by a text message to Brown from another woman .
The petition , which has received 10,600 signatures , says Nickelodeon should have removed Brown from the list of nominees for the awards evening on 28 March immediately the charges were filed .
He is up for two awards , favourite male singer and favourite song .
The petition calls for Rihanna 's name to be stripped from the list of nominees on the grounds that she has vowed to continue the relationship with Brown . ""
While we do n't think public figures are expected to always act responsibly in the name of being a role model , this situation is unacceptable on both sides .
To say that either of these people setting a suitable example to be held up as ' winners ' is preposterous , "" the petition says .
The alleged violent attack has earned Brown widespread opprobrium .
The TV celebrity Oprah Winfrey has announced plans to hold a special show dedicated to domestic abuse of women .
She told Rihanna : "" If a man hits you once , he will hit you again .
He will hit you again . ""
Nickelodeon has so far resisted the pressure to remove Brown and Rihanna from the nominees ' list .
A spokesman for the channel said : "" Chris Brown was nominated by kids several months ago based on his body of work as a performer , and the kids who vote will ultimately decide who wins in the category . """
"Chris Brown has withdrawn his name from the Kids ' Choice awards ballot , saying that the controversy over his suitability had "" shifted the focus from the music "" .
More than 10,000 fans had signed an online petition asking the Nickelodeon TV network to strike Brown 's name from the awards ceremony .
Brown 's song Kiss Kiss had been nominated for favourite song , with the 19-year - old himself up for the award for favourite male singer .
"" Chris very much appreciates the support of his fans and the honour they have paid him in the way of nominations , "" his representative said in a statement yesterday . ""
Unfortunately , the controversy surrounding the incident last month has shifted the focus from the music to whether he should be allowed to be among those nominated .
While Chris would like to speak to his fans directly about this and other issues , pending legal proceedings preclude his doing so at this time .
Once the matter before him has been resolved , he intends to do so . ""
Nickelodeon confirmed that Brown had withdrawn his name and said that they "" agree with and respect his decision "" .
The antipathy towards Brown relates to his being charged after an incident on 8 February in which he is alleged to have attacked his girlfriend , the singer Rihanna .
Brown will be back in court on 6 April and faces up to four years in prison if found guilty .
The petition had also asked for Rihanna to be dropped from the Kids ' Choice awards , condemning her reported reconciliation with Brown . ""
While we do n't think public figures are expected to always act responsibly in the name of being a role model , this situation is unacceptable on both sides , "" the petition said .
For the moment , Rihanna is still nominated in the category for favourite female singer .
The awards ceremony takes place 28 March ."
"Rihanna and Chris Brown have recorded a reunion duet , it was confirmed yesterday .
A representative for producer Polow Da Don confirmed he recorded the duet with the couple earlier this week , just days after Brown was charged with two felonies for the alleged assault of his girlfriend Rihanna .
Brown , 19 , and Rihanna , 21 , were involved in an alleged violent altercation in the early morning of 8 February .
Both singers cancelled their appearances at the Grammys before reconciling three weeks later at the Miami home of P Diddy .
"" My heart goes out to both Chris and Rihanna for what has happened in the past , "" said Polow Da Don .
"" They are both great artists to work with , and I wish them well . ""
This is the second time the producer has worked with the pair .
Their first duet , Bad Girl , was recorded for the Confessions of a Shopaholic soundtrack but did n't make the album 's final cut .
The new song is "" about growing stronger in a relationship "" , according to a source from Us magazine . ""
The song was originally created for Rihanna before the fight , however , it was n't initially slated for Chris to be on the song . ""
"" The funny thing is , the song expresses the emotions that both Chris and Rihanna are feeling at this moment â€ “ facing challenges and overcoming the ups and downs of a relationship , "" the source said .
In this case , the alleged "" downs "" are criminal offences .
Brown is facing charges of assault and making criminal threats .
He is due in court on 6 April ."
"Nearly half of Boston - area teenagers say Rihanna was responsible for pop star Chris Brown 's alleged Grammy night attack that landed her in the hospital , according to a new survey by the Boston Public Health Commission .
The survey of 200 Boston youths age 12 to 19 found that 51 % said Brown bore responsibility , 46 % said Rihanna was responsible , and 52 % said both were to blame for the incident .
In addition , 52 % said the media were treating Brown unfairly , and "" a significant number of males and females "" surveyed said Rihanna was destroying Brown 's career .
Click here for the full results of the survey .
This is beyond disturbing .
Somehow our children have learned that violence is an acceptable and appropriate response to a domestic disagreement .
This is what children learn from media messages like this cover of broad - circulating supermarket tabloid Star , which purports to reveal "" What made Chris snap "" .
As if Rihanna could have said something to which the brutal attack of which Brown is accused was an understandable reaction .
As if she stepped over the line and the vicious blows that bloodied her nose and mouth and swelled her eyes and forehead were justified .
I was cheered to see that Brown , himself a teenager , though one apparently more entitled , self - indulgent and spoiled than most , removed himself from nomination from the Nickelodeon Kids ' Choice awards show after more than 10,000 people signed a petition asking for his ejection .
That 's not enough for me .
Brown is charged with two felonies and if he is found guilty in the incident he should land behind bars .
According to the Boston survey 100 % of the surveyed youths had heard of the Rihanna - Chris Brown case .
American kids are paying attention .
Clearly , they have not yet learned that this kind of violence is utterly unacceptable , and if Brown is given a celebrity pass and allowed to rehabilitate himself , they wo n't .
What do you think ?
I 'm not interested in hearing that Rihanna bears a share of the blame for this .
But I do want to hear how Americans or Brits can use this incident to teach young people about domestic violence ."
"Sky1 has acquired an Australian reality series Bondi Vet , that follows the adventures of a Sydney vet .
The 14-part series , which follows surfer and vet Dr Chris Brown 's job dealing with local wildlife , pets and their owners , will air daily from 6 April .
In Australia , where it is shown on Channel 10 , the series has been fairly well received .
The Sydney Morning Herald said the series was "" hardly an accurate snapshot of life as a Sydney vet but it is pleasantly diverting "" while WA Today.com called the show "" cute "" .
The series , which is produced by WFTN Entertainment , has already been sold to broadcasters including Sky New Zealand , VTM Belgium , TV4 Sweden and YLE Finland .
Sky 1 acquisitions executive Julia Stuart , summed up the appeal of Brown , who has been described as the "" new Steve Irwin "" .
She said : "" The UK has been without an antipodean animal lover for some time .
Now we have Dr Chris Brown : a tall , blond , hunky surfer type .
I 'm sure Dr Chris will be a huge hit with the Sky1 audience and brighten up everyone 's early evening . ""
Brown has become a popular TV presence down under , adept at swapping the surfboard for the stethoscope after his morning surf .
He grew up in the city of Newcastle , north of Sydney , where his father was a vet and his backyard was home to all manner of critters , from chickens to ducks , koalas , kangaroos , horses , cows , a donkey and even a pet penguin for six months .
Brown recounts that it was the sudden decline and death of his dog and best mate , Claude , that convinced him to become a vet .
"" I was 17 at the time and it really shook me up .
I wanted to know everything about the heart condition that killed him .
It showed me that I not only cared immensely for them [ animals ] but that I was also fascinated by how they work and how to keep them healthy , "" he said .
His TV career began three years after he graduated with honours from Sydney University when he was spotted in a pub telling stories over a few beers .
He signed up to be the new vet on Harry 's Practice , before he was poached by Burke 's Backyard and went on to appear on the morning Today programme before signing up to present his own series , Bondi Vet .
Brown now writes the popular "" pet page "" in Woman 's Day , is corporate ambassador for the well - known Purina pet care brand and an ambassador for Assistance Dogs Australia , a charity that aims to increase the independence of people with physical disabilities .
He lives with Rusty , the kelpie and failed farm dog ; a pet yabby ( crayfish ) , Max ; and two goldfish .

"Neither braggadocio or an elevated sense of style are likely to save Kanye West from this one .
The rapper - producer faces 30 months in jail after being charged in connection with his airport tantrum last autumn .
The incident took place on 11 September 2008 , in the golden days before the term "" altercation "" had been monopolised by Rihanna and Chris Brown .
West and road manager Dan Crawley were at Los Angeles International Airport when they got into a dispute with two amateur paparazzi .
At least two cameras were allegedly smashed as West and Crawley demanded the footage , including the explicit order to "" Gimme that fucking tape ! ""
Both men were eventually restrained by police .
Footage of the incident later appeared on gossip site TMZ .
West was charged with misdemeanour battery , grand theft and vandalism .
Crawley faces two of each of the same charges , and up to five years in jail if convicted .
All charges were brought by outgoing city attorney Rocky Delgadillo , who picked up the case after Los Angeles prosecutors decided not to pursue it , the Associated Press reports .
Delgadillo is the same prosecutor who targeted Britney Spears last year for an improperly registered driver 's licence , but the case was eventually dropped .
West has yet to comment – or blog – about the charges .
Earlier this week he did , however , reveal the way his popular , and prolific , blog works .
"" I might [ blog for ] two hours in a day , [ I ] might [ for ] 15 minutes in a day , "" he told New York Magazine .
"" I have two people that I hired
and I tell them exactly what I want ...
I tell them , you know , Surface magazine , Wallpaper , Architectural Digest , Hypebeast , Bossip – go to these different blogs and keep on pulling information .
And then they send it to me , and I get like 80 emails , and I have to check and go through them .
And sometimes I 'll have my own stuff where I 'll just be in a cool place , like if I had my camera right now , I 'd like photograph this stuff and go home and be really excited to blog it .
You know , cause I 'm in cool places all the time .
"" If you happen to be in a cool place with Kanye West , however , it 's probably best not to take his photograph ."

"R&amp;B star Chris Brown pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges that he threatened and assaulted his girlfriend , singer Rihanna .
Brown arrived 25 minutes late for the 3 pm arraignment , amid a flurry of last - minute plea bargain rumours .
Rihanna was not present .
After judge Patricia Schnegg read the charges , of assaulting Rihanna "" by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury "" and of threatening to commit a crime "" which would result in death and great bodily injury "" , the 19-year - old murmured his plea . ""
Not guilty , your honour , "" he said .
They were the only words Brown spoke in court .
The singer spent less than 15 minutes at the Los Angeles superior court , entering his plea and then departing in a black SUV , escorted by four bodyguards .
The charges stem from an alleged altercation between the couple on the early hours of 8 February .
According to a police affidavit , Brown shoved Rihanna 's head against the passenger window , punched her in the face , bit her ear and finger and put her into a headlock .
"" I 'm going to kill you , "" he allegedly told her .
Brown later said that he was "" sorry and saddened "" about the incident .
He faces up to four years in prison if convicted .
Although Brown 's attorney did not make a statement to the press , a lawyer for Rihanna spoke to reporters after the hearing .
Donald Etra confirmed that Rihanna is in her native Barbados but would testify if subpoenaed .
Asked directly if his client thought Brown is guilty , Etra said , "" Her position on the case is to leave the matters of guilt or innocence to the judge and or defence counsel "" .
The two pop stars are thought to have reconciled , although they have not recently been seen together .
Brown will return to court for a status hearing on 29 April ."
"The lawyer for Chris Brown is arguing for the singer 's case to be dismissed due to "" leaks "" to the media concerning the trial .
Attorney Mark Geragos explained his plans in a Los Angeles court yesterday , requesting another hearing postponement .
"" Leaks can form the basis for a motion to dismiss the case in regard to outrageous governmental misconduct , "" Geragos told reporters .
An intense media spotlight has been on Brown since 8 February , when the 19-year - old is alleged to have beaten his girlfriend , R&amp;B star Rihanna .
Though she declined to press charges , the district attorney 's office is pursuing Brown for assault and making criminal threats .
Several details of the case made their way to the press , including a photograph of a badly injured Rihanna and information from the initial police report .
Though Los Angeles police promised to investigate these leaks , no findings have been announced thus far .
Brown did not appear at yesterday 's court hearing , where Geragos claimed that LAPD evidence still had not been released to him .
He requested additional discovery time for the case , and a new hearing was scheduled for 28 May.
The judge also responded to Rihanna 's request that some of her jewellery , currently held as evidence , be released .
Items worth as much as $ 1.4 m ( Â£950,000 ) were taken from the singer on the night of the incident and held in police custody .
The judge ruled that police should hand over the jewellery , leaving the court to make do with photographs of the items .
Brown 's lawyers are understood to be pursuing a plea deal ."

"Disgraced R&amp;B singer Chris Brown has posted an online video in which he announces his comeback .
In his first public comments since his alleged assault of Rihanna in February , Brown condemned "" haters "" , embraced his "" real fans "" and denied being a "" monster "" .
"" I just want to say ' what up ' because I ai n't been out there in a minute , "" Brown said in a video blog , flanked by rapper Bow Wow .
"" We ai n't going nowhere .
Everybody that 's haters , they just been haters .
All my real fans â€ “ I love y' all . ""
"" I ai n't a monster , "" Brown underlined .
Bow Wow chimed in â€ “
"" Believe that ! ""
The 20-year - old appeared on camera in front of an unlikely backdrop â€ “ a bowling alley .
Brown said he is currently working on his third album , tentatively titled Graffiti , which he plans to release in the late summer .
It will be preceded by a single , he said .
Brown has pleaded not guilty to charges of assault and making criminal threats after allegedly punching , choking and biting his then girlfriend , singer Rihanna .
If convicted , he faces up to five years in prison ."
"Rihanna will testify at next month 's hearing in the Chris Brown case , her lawyer has confirmed .
Prosecutors have said that they will issue a subpoena calling the singer to discuss the events of 8 February , when Brown allegedly assaulted her .
Rihanna 's lawyer Donald Etra said that she will comply with the order and attend the 22 June hearing .
This would be the singer 's first court appearance since charges were filed against Brown in March .
Etra would not comment on the current relationship between Brown and Rihanna , but said that his client was closely following the case .
Brown is accused of attacking Rihanna in the couple 's rented car on the weekend of this year 's Grammy awards .
If convicted , he faces up to five years in jail .
Making his first public comments since being charged , Brown said yesterday that he was "" not a monster "" .
Brown is also confirmed to appear at the 22 June hearing , setting the stage for a tense confrontation between the couple .
Los Angeles superior court judge Patricia Schnegg has also ruled on a motion brought by Brown 's lawyer , Mark Geragos , regarding a police photograph of Rihanna that was apparently leaked to the press .
Judge Schnegg deemed the motion premature , calling it "" a fishing expedition "" ."
"Lawyers representing R&amp;B singer Chris Brown announced a last - minute plea deal yesterday , forestalling the expected testimony of his former girlfriend , pop star Rihanna .
Brown pleaded guilty to one count of felony assault , avoiding a prison sentence .
Instead , Brown will serve up to five years of supervised probation and six months of community labour .
Brown stated his plea in a Los Angeles court , with Rihanna also present in the room .
Judge Patricia M Schnegg imposed a stay - away order on the pair so that they remain at least 50 yards from each other .
That distance is reduced to just 10 yards at industry events , but Schnegg warned Rihanna that she would be in violation of the order if she approached her former assailant .
Police were called to the scene of a domestic quarrel in the early hours of 8 February , where Rihanna â€ “ then in a relationship with Brown â€ “ was found with injuries to her face .
According to a police affidavit , the row began when Rihanna found a text message from another woman on Brown 's mobile phone .
He later tried to push her from the parked car , choking her , punching her repeatedly and allegedly biting her ear .
When Rihanna pretended to phone her assistant for police help , Brown threatened to kill her .
After the hearing , Rihanna 's lawyer confirmed that she had not requested the court 's stay - away order .
Though the singer had previously been granted an order of protection against Brown , the couple briefly reunited in March .
Under these new terms , however , Rihanna and Brown would not be allowed even a cordial , long - distance relationship .
Besides the restrictions on their physical proximity , the pair are not allowed to contact each other .
In May , Brown made his first direct public comments , thanking his fans and dismissing his detractors .
"" Everybody that 's haters , they just been haters , "" he said in a video .
"" I ai n't a monster . ""
Brown 's formal sentencing will take place 5 August ."
"R&amp;B star Chris Brown had been involved in two unreported incidents of domestic violence prior to his February assault of Rihanna , according to a probation officer 's report .
Brown shoved Rihanna in a dispute late last year , and broke the windows of a car in an argument with the singer three weeks before she was found bruised and bleeding by Los Angeles police .
Details of the incidents emerged after Brown 's probation officer filed a report at a hearing earlier this week .
Brown was formally sentenced to five years ' probation and 180 days of community labour , as agreed in a plea deal this June .
He had been charged with the felonies of assault and making criminal threats against Rihanna following their altercation in the early hours of 8 February .
Three months before the assualt , however , Brown and Rihanna had another violent exchange .
The pair were in Europe , the LA Times reports , when a "" verbal dispute "" broke out .
Rihanna slapped Brown , who responded by pushing her into a wall .
The pattern repeated in January , when the celebrity couple were on holiday in Barbados , where Rihanna was brought up .
After an argument broke out , Brown got out of the Range Rover they were driving and shattered both the front driver and passenger side windows .
Neither Rihanna , 21 , nor Brown , 19 , was injured in either incident .
The altercations were not reported to authorities .
In an interview with the probation officer , Brown said he was "" ashamed and embarrassed "" and did not want to "" carry on [ the ] cycle [ of violence ] "" .
Besides probation , community labour and an order that he stay away from Rihanna , judge Patricia Schnegg instructed Brown to undergo a year - long domestic violence course in his home state of Virginia ."
"In Chris Brown 's first public interview since his arrest and plea for assaulting Rihanna , the R&amp;B star said that he can not recall the violent events of 8 February .
"" When I hear about the police reports , I do n't know what to think , "" Brown told CNN 's Larry King , in a programme to be broadcast on Wednesday ( 2 September ) .
"" That 's not who I am as a person .
It 's like crazy to me . ""
It is more than six months since police were called to a Los Angeles neighbourhood and found Rihanna , Brown 's pop - star girlfriend , bruised and battered .
Brown has made few public statements since the event â€ “ generally saying that he is "" sorry "" and is seeking therapy .
In this week 's interview with King , however , Brown 's remorse is accompanied by disbelief .
"" When I look at it now , it 's just like , wow , like , I ca n't believe that that actually happened . ""
Brown 's lawyer , Mark Geragos , and his mother , Joyce Hawkins , accompanied him for the interviews .
Hawkins said she was "" totally shocked "" when she heard what had happened .
"" I know that Chris has never , ever been a violent person , ever , "" she said .
This comes after last week 's report that February 's assault was at least the third incident of domestic violence between Brown and Rihanna .
While Brown 's plea bargain prevents him from directly contacting or approaching Rihanna , Hawkins got in touch on his behalf . ""
[ I ] let her know that I was very , very baffled [ by ] what had happened , and apologised for my son , along with I 'm so sorry what happened to you , "" she told King . ""
I did n't know what else to say , and I gave her a hug , and she hugged me , as well . ""
According to CNN , Brown said he is still in love with Rihanna â€ “ even if a court has ordered them to stay 100 yards apart .
"" I never fell out of love with her , "" Brown told People magazine . ""
That just would n't go away . ""
He said he would "" definitely be affected by "" Rihanna dating other people , but "" at the end of the day ... we 're not together , so , if she 's happy , I 'm cool . ""
"" I just need to prove to people I can be a role model , "" Brown said ."
"Chris Brown is not so forgetful after all , the R&amp;B star admitted yesterday , despite telling an interviewer that he did not recall assaulting Rihanna .
"" Of course I remember what happened , "" he said , "" but it was and still is a blur .
"" Brown blamed producers on Larry King Live for manipulating his answers in an interview to be aired tonight ( Wednesday 2 September ) .
The 20-year - old singer was repeatedly questioned on the events of 8 February , and he said they edited his comments for maximum shock value .
"" That 30 seconds of the interview they used of me was taken from a one - hour interview during which that same question was asked something like four or five times , "" Brown said .
"" It is not representative of what I said ...
The first four times â€ “ or how ever many times it was
â€ “
I gave the same answer â€ “ which was that I did n't think it was appropriate for me to talk about what happened that night .
I said it was not right for me
and it really was n't fair to Rihanna .
The fifth time â€ “ or whatever it was â€ “
I just misspoke .
I was asked , ' Do you remember doing it ? ' , and I said , ' No . ' "" "" As I have said several times previously , I am ashamed of and sorry for what happened that night
and I wish I could relive that moment and change things , but I ca n't .
I take full responsibility for my actions . ""
In June , Brown pleaded guilty to assaulting Rihanna on the morning of this year 's Grammy awards .
He avoided a prison sentence but will serve five years of probation and six months of community labour .
Brown is barred from contacting his former girlfriend ."

"A day after Jermaine Jackson announced that Chris Brown and Mary J Blige would sing at a tribute concert for Michael Jackson , representatives for both artists denied that they will perform .
Organisers of the Vienna concert have since denied the denials , admitting that although Brown 's performance is at the discretion of a US judge , Blige "" will be there "" .
Jackson 's initial announcement was unequivocal : "" We have Chris Brown ! ""
he said at a press conference on Tuesday .
That was n't the view of Brown 's publicist .
"" Chris is not confirmed to perform or participate in any capacity for this show , "" he told E !
News yesterday .
Jackson responded at a follow - up press conference in London .
"" Chris Brown is working out some situations , "" he conceded .
"" It 's up to the judge if he gets let out of the [ USA ] or not .
I 'm not worried at all .
He wants to be here . ""
Last month , Brown was sentenced to five years ' probation for assaulting his former girlfriend , the pop star Rihanna .
Brown would need court approval to fly to Vienna for the concert , which would be a break from his 180 hours of scheduled community labour . ""
[ Chris is ] definitely going to work that out and be here , "" Jackson said , expressing his support for the embattled R&amp;B singer . ""
He 's asked for forgiveness .
If Christ can forgive him , so can we .
People make mistakes , but he 's a wonderful performer . ""
The appearance of Mary J Blige , another of the tribute concert 's headliners , is no more certain .
A representative for the singer told ABC News that Blige will be at a fashion show in Italy on the day of the event .
Jackson dismissed these reports , saying that he had spoken to Blige 's husband and they would fly her in for the second half of the show .
Her camp has not yet replied .
Organisers also dismissed claims that Michael 's mother , Katherine Jackson , has opposed the 26 September concert .
She was a supporter "" from the very start "" , according to co - producer George Kindel . ""
She will be there with Michael 's kids . ""
Organisers expect some 65,000 fans to attend the Vienna concert .
Besides Blige and Brown , the announced performers include Akon , Natalie Cole , Sister Sledge and German boy - band US5 .
Jackson said he has also "" invited "" Stevie Wonder , R Kelly and Maroon 5 ."
"Chris Brown has swapped his once - glamourous lifestyle for picking up rubbish .
The R&amp;B singer has begun serving his sentence of 180 days of community labour , ordered after Brown pleaded guilty to assaulting the pop star Rihanna .
As Brown tries to regain face after seven months of bad publicity , his spin - doctors seem to be going big with the singer 's rehabilitation .
First , Brown announced on Twitter that he was "" on [ his ] way to community service "" .
Then , photos of the singer in state - issued reflective vest and red cap appeared online â€ “ not via paparazzi sites like TMZ , but on Brown 's newly - launched blog , Mechanical Dummy .
The site accompanied the images with some real food for thought : "" Stop and think back to the last time you accepted responsibility for something .
Undertaking responsibility for each one of your actions is a difficult task but by admiting [ sic ] your mistakes you are taking your life to a higher level of accountability . ""
According to its About page , Mechanical Dummy "" is an entertainment brand that encompasses interactive media , merchandising , and a TV series "" .
The TV series is perhaps related to the site 's banner image , which features Brown as a cartoon cyborg .
Something tells us this series has been harder to market since Brown became the year 's most notorious domestic abuser .
These days , Brown does n't want to talk about all that .
"" I ai n't postin s *
* * else about me ( personally ) ... I 'm so over all this bulls
* * * , "" he wrote on Twitter yesterday .
Instead , Brown will spend the next 180 days cleaning police stables , collecting litter , washing official vehicles and removing graffiti around his native Richmond , Virginia .
And working on that comeback ."
"Turns out Rihanna is n't the only one with a new release .
The singer 's ex - boyfriend , Chris Brown , also has a new video out .
Sadly we ca n't watch it yet , but Brown has posted a few behind - the - scenes shots to whet your appetite .
There 's Lil Wayne playing the guitar , Brown flashing his naked torso , Brown dressed in an outfit with some disturbing military / Jedi undertones , and Brown doing a ninja kick .
Yes , Brown dressed as a ninja .
With nunchucks .
Considering most people this side of the Atlantic only heard of Brown when he assaulted his then girlfriend Rihanna , does anyone else find it a tad surprising that this bright spark was n't advised that perhaps , just maybe , the whole flying kick thing was a bad idea ?"
"Rihanna has opened up for the first time since her assault by Chris Brown in February .
In a magazine interview â€ “ and a television appearance that will air later this week
â€ “
the singer has described the tumultuous last eight months and what it 's like to "" [ go ] to sleep as Rihanna and [ wake ] up as Britney Spears "" .
"" This happened to me ... it could happen to anyone , "" Rihanna told Diane Sawyer of US network ABC .
The pop star confessed that her ex - boyfriend , R&amp;B singer Chris Brown , was "" definitely "" her "" first big love "" .
Rihanna also spoke to Glamour magazine , where she was yesterday named Woman of the Year . ""
Domestic violence is a big secret , "" she said .
"" No kid goes around and lets people know their parents fight .
Teenage girls ca n't tell their parents that their boyfriend beat them up .
You do n't dare let your neighbour know that you fight .
It 's one of the things we [ women ] will hide , because it 's embarrassing .
My story was broadcast all over the world for people to see , and they have followed every step of my recovery .
The positive thing that has come out of my situation is that people can learn from that .
I want to give as much insight as I can to young women , because I feel like I represent a voice that really is n't heard .
Now I can help speak for those women . ""
Though her friends and family have been "" extremely supportive "" , Rihanna admitted that "" at some point you are there alone "" .
"" It 's a lonely place to be â€ “ no one can understand .
That 's when you get close to God . ""
Even after the assault , she said "" it was one thing after another "" , particularly the "" humiliating "" release of a police photograph showing Rihanna 's bruised face .
"" I felt completely taken advantage of .
I felt like people were making it into a fun topic on the internet , and it 's my life .
I was disappointed , especially when I found out the photo was [ allegedly leaked by ] two women . ""
"" I went to sleep as Rihanna and woke up as Britney Spears , "" she told Glamour .
"" That was the level of media chaos that happened the next day .
It was like , ' There are helicopters circling my house ?
There are 100 people in my cul - de - sac ?
What do you mean , I ca n't go back home ? ' ...
People forget that after we get to our hotel rooms at night , we take a shower , we watch TV , eat room service and do normal things .
Behind it all , we are still human beings . ""
Rihanna 's interview with Diane Sawyer will appear on Good Morning America and 20/20 , this Thursday and Friday .
Her new album , Rated R , is due 23 November ."
"Rihanna has dismissed the feelings she once held for Chris Brown , saying that her brief reconciliation with her ex - boyfriend was "" embarrassing "" .
In her first interview since her assault by Brown in February , the 21-year - old R&amp;B star told Diane Sawyer , host of current affairs programme 20/20 , that women in abusive relationships should "" F love "" .
"" There are a lot of women who have experienced this , but not in public , "" Rihanna told Sawyer . ""
That made it really difficult .
I thought , ' There goes my little bit of privacy ' .
It 's something that nobody wants anybody to know .
So here I am , the whole world knowing . ""
The singer explained her perspective on the events of 8 February , when police found her battered after a fight with Brown . ""
This happened to me , "" she said .
"" I did n't cause this .
I did n't do it . ""
But she took responsibility for an "" embarrassing "" â€ “ and temporary â€ “ reconciliation with Brown shortly after the incident . ""
[ I was ] so far in love , so unconditional , that I went back , "" she said .
"" That 's not what I want to teach people ...
I realised that my selfish decision for love could result in some young girl getting killed . ""
Rihanna "" did n't realise how much of an impact I had on [ young ] girls ' lives until that happened . ""
"" It was a wake - up call for me , big time ...
Even if Chris never hit me again , who is to say that their boyfriend wo n't ?
Who 's to say that they wo n't kill these girls ? ""
In August , Brown pleaded guilty to the assault and was sentenced to community service with five years of probation .
As Rihanna prepares to release a new album on 23 November , Brown is trying to restart his own career with a new album .
An interview with Brown is to air tonight on MTV , within hours of Rihanna 's scheduled appearance on 20/20 .
Speaking to Sawyer , Rihanna appeared calm , thoughtful and resolute .
"" I 'll say that to any young girl who is going through domestic violence : Do n't react out of love .
F love .
Come out of the situation and look at it third - person and for what it really is , and then make your decision , because love is so blind . """
""" I 'm just like â€ ¦ ' wow ! ' "" said a flummoxed looking Chris Brown as talkshow host Larry King asked him about the Rihanna "" incident "" .
His noncommittal response was perhaps not the teary confessional that was expected after the Grammy - night altercation which changed everything for the then crown prince of R&amp;B. Brown was the best of the bunch of the "" new Ushers "" .
Mixing unflinchingly futuristic sounds with fluid choreography and a bell - clear voice , there was something effortless about him .
Little wonder he was the only male artist to go straight to the top of the Billboard charts with his first single and , in 2006 , win five Kids ' Choice awards , beating off the likes of Justin Timberlake .
Flash - forward three years , and he was pleading guilty to felony assault on ex - girlfriend Rihanna .
But as Chris Brown prepares to release new album , Graffiti , is it possible that his charge of domestic abuse wo n't dent his record sales at all ?
There 's not been a case like it before .
The rumblings of R Kelly 's liaisons with underage girls which have dogged him for the last decade have never really affected his status ; indeed , just this year , he penned the title track of Whitney Houston 's comeback album .
And Ike Turner was far from at his peak when Tina finally decided enough was enough .
Partly because there 's been no precedent , Brown 's team have blindly attempted to continue as before .
After the shots of Rihanna 's disfigured face leaked online , pictures of Brown on a jetski looking less than contrite ( and more like he was in a P Diddy video ) were floated on the internet .
A few months later , intimate snaps of the former couple were leaked , the timing of which suggested some sleazy attempt to discredit Rihanna 's assault claims .
And then came Brown 's bizarrely dead - eyed Larry King appearance .
And now here 's the video for Brown 's new single ,
I Can Transform Ya , featuring Brown dressed as a neon samurai , re - enacting various martial arts moves and throwing nunchucks around .
The context of which seems tasteless , given some of the claims of physical violence levelled against Brown .
Meanwhile , there 's been a distinct lack of outcry from the music industry .
The likes of Mary J Blige , Usher and Kanye West seem more concerned with being politically correct than speaking out about against the attack , while TI , Ne - Yo and Bow
Wow all issued statements saying what a nice guy Chris Brown is , with TI stating how he 's "" only human "" .
But perhaps more worrying is the fact that his legion of teenage girl fans have forgiven his actions , posting comments like "" I do n't care what anyone says , I still love you Chris Brown "" on fan forums .
A nostalgic Brown has been tweeting about his former paramour , but will this late show of guilt work come Graffiti 's December 's release date ?"
"Nine months after Chris Brown assaulted Rihanna , the R&amp;B star has asked his ex - girlfriend to keep the attack "" private "" . ""
The details should remain ... between us , "" Brown said , referring to last week 's TV interview between Rihanna and Diane Sawyer on American current affairs programme 20/20 .
In the second half of a two - part interview with Sawyer , Rihanna relived her argument with Brown as they drove home from an industry party on 8 February .
According to Rihanna , Brown received a text message from another woman â€ “ but denied it .
"" I caught him in a lie , and he would n't tell the truth .
And I would n't drop it .
I could n't take that he kept lying to me , and he could n't take that I would n't drop it .
And ... it was ugly . ""
According to police reports , Brown bit Rihanna , put her in a head lock and punched her several times in the face .
Hearing these allegations , Rihanna nodded .
"" I fended him off with my feet , "" she said .
"" He had no soul in his eyes .
Just blank .
He was clearly blacked - out .
There was no person when I looked at him .
It was almost as if he had nothing to lose .
He had so much to lose .
It was n't the same person that says I love you .
It definitely was n't those eyes . ""
Asked if alcohol played a role in the events that night , Rihanna said .
"" No , we were n't even drunk . ""
"" I was battered , I was bleeding , I was swollen in the face , "" she said .
"" So there was no way of me getting home , except ... to get out of the car and walk .
Start walking in a gown , in a bloody face .
So I really do n't know what my plan was . ""
Eventually , a passer - by called police to the scene .
After Rihanna 's appearance on 20/20 , Brown said : "" While I respect Rihanna 's right to discuss the specific events of 8 February , I maintain my position that all of the details should remain a private matter between us .
I do appreciate her support and wish her the best .
I am extremely sorry for what I did , and I accept accountability for my actions .
Abuse of any kind is always wrong .
The rest I leave it to God . ""
"" Love does n't go away right away , "" Rihanna said .
"" I do n't hate [ Chris ] at all .
I actually love and care about him .
I want him to do well , have a great career , have a great life and grow up . ""
She spoke out against an "" unnecessary "" court ruling , ordered as part of Brown 's plea bargain , which prevents the two singers from coming into contact with each other .
"" I [ do n't ] want it to be interrupting my work .
Like if I went to an event , I 'd have to think , ' Oh my gosh , I 'd have to stay 10 yards away from him . '
It 's a spectacle , it 's too much . """
"Never has a case of domestic abuse played out as publicly as that of R&amp;B star Rihanna .
She was brutally beaten up by her ex - boyfriend , the singer Chris Brown , on the eve of the Grammy awards ; within a fortnight , a leaked photo of her bruised , swollen face was plastered across the internet ; the subsequent 10 months have seen every titbit of possible gossip regarding her recovery process disseminated and scrutinised .
In spite of her experience being played out under an unprecedented spotlight , the Bajan R&amp;B star is starting to seize control of her story .
Last week , she gave an interview to Diane Sawyer of ABC 's 20/20 .
The message the 21-year - old articulated , which prioritised emotional honesty over canned PR platitudes , is carried over into Rihanna 's new album , Rated R. A dark , even forbidding work , it eschews the club - friendly dance - pop that dominated her last album , 2007 's Good Girl Gone Bad .
Instead , Rihanna alternates between wounded , aching balladry and a tough , newly swaggering resilience .
The overall impression is of a woman rebuilding her broken self - image from scratch â€ “ and succeeding on her own terms .
"" I thought I saw your potential â€ “ guess that 's what made me dumb , "" she mourns on Stupid
In Love â€ “ a song that was , in fact , written by Ne - Yo three days before the Grammys incident , and which Rihanna has described as a "" premonition "" .
Elsewhere , she sneers "" I never play the victim : I 'd rather be a stalker , "" on the Slash - featuring Rockstar 101 , and on the triumphant Hard , she snaps : "" No pain is forever : yup , you know this .
"" It is an album that rings psychologically true , and provides a fresh insight into how and why Rihanna 's fans find it easy to identify with her .
A particularly disturbing moment in her interview came when Rihanna reproached herself with the thought that her initial decision to go back to Brown was a "" selfish decision for love [ that ] could result in some girl getting killed "" .
In the days following Rihanna 's 20/20 interview , calls to the National Domestic Violence Hotline rose by 59 % â€ “ with the National Teen Dating Abuse Helpline seeing a 73 % increase .
While Rihanna should not be made into the poster girl for domestic abuse merely by dint of her celebrity stature , she deserves full credit for the way that her words resonated with so many women in similar positions .
It is ironic , of course , that such a shining example of strength and leadership should come from a woman whose image and music had seen her hitherto dismissed by some as an over - sexualised pop cipher ; and it is instructive to compare her words with those of a performer who has been sold and accepted , not least by herself , as a positive alternative role model to R&amp;B divas such as Rihanna .
Elly Jackson , singer of synthpop outfit La Roux , has gained plaudits for her androgynous image , but opining on domestic abuse , Jackson was quick to blame the victims : "" Women wonder why they get beaten up , or have relationships with arsehole men .
Because you attracted one , you twat . ""
When Rihanna performs on stage wearing a skimpy leotard , as she did this week at a comeback showcase concert at Brixton Academy , she may attract the ire and contempt of the likes of Jackson .
But if public figures must be role models , it is a no - brainer as to which is preferable : the acceptably unsexy but essentially misogynist one , or the glamorous pop star whose words and music have negotiated a crucial feminist issue with aplomb and had a real , positive impact on women 's lives ."
"Two weeks from its release , Timbaland has dropped R&amp;B singer Chris Brown from his forthcoming album , calling the last - minute decision "" mutual "" .
Brown recorded vocals for The One I Love before his assault on then girlfriend Rihanna in February .
"" There 's nothing against Chris , "" said Timbaland 's manager , Marcus Spence .
"" We love Chris . ""
And yet Spence would n't explain the reason for Brown 's disappearance from Shock Value II , Timbaland 's third solo album .
"" It was a mutually creative decision for both , "" he said .
That decision was perhaps informed by the events of 8 February , when Brown attacked Rihanna .
Since pleading guilty to assault in August , Brown has tried to resurrect his career , launching a "" Fan Appreciation "" tour and rallying musical supporters like Soulja Boy and New Yung Joc .
According to DOE , a rapper who also appears on The One I Love , the song did n't always have that name .
Originally called Maniac , the title was only changed this summer , after "" some people "" saw a PR disaster waiting to happen .
It 's this kind of "" drama "" , a source told TMZ , that resulted in Brown and Timbaland parting ways .
Shock Value II will be released 8 December , the same day as Brown 's own comeback album , Graffiti ."
"Highly critical comments by a senior army officer asked to conduct a study of the circumstances surrounding the invasion of Iraq have been suppressed on the orders of the country 's top defence officials , the Guardian has learned .
The study , by Lt Gen Chris Brown , was commissioned in the light of mounting evidence of the failure to prepare properly for the invasion and its consequences .
Former senior military officers and defence officials have already described their anger and frustration about the failures in damning testimony to the Chilcot inquiry into the 2003 Iraq invasion .
One of the inquiry 's key objectives is to spell out the lessons that should be learned from what is widely regarded in Whitehall as an ill - conceived operation of dubious legality and , in foreign policy terms , a disaster comparable to the 1956 Suez crisis .
Against this background , the Ministry of Defence agreed to conduct its own study .
However , Brown 's criticisms were so harsh that they have been suppressed following the intervention of Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup , chief of the defence staff , and other officials , who considered them too embarrassing even for internal consumption at the MoD. Defence chiefs also appear to be worried that once Brown 's study was passed to Sir John Chilcot to help him with his inquiry , they would lose control of the contents .
An MoD spokesman told the Guardian : "" Lt Gen Chris Brown has led a small team in the production of an internal , classified MoD paper examining the Iraq campaign for the purpose of learning lessons for the future .
As part of the routine staffing of such an important piece of work , a variety of military officials and civil servants have provided input during the paper 's development . ""
In a comment making it clear it expects to be given the study , the Chilcot inquiry said : "" The inquiry is aware of the MoD 's internal study of lessons learned in Iraq .
We do not comment on specific documents we hold but , as we said before , the inquiry is confident that it will be given access to all relevant government documents . ""
Whitehall officials made plain tonight that these statements disguise deep sensitivity about the revelation that there is an internal MoD dispute over the study .
Colonel Richard Kemp , a former commander of British forces in Afghanistan and commentator on military matters , said : "" Defence is far too important , a matter of life and death , to get too sensitive about potential embarrassment .
"" Brown was the last senior British military representative in Baghdad in 2009 .
He was subsequently appointed to the post of "" Iraq study team leader "" .
He was previously involved in planning Nato operations in Kosovo and was commander of British troops in Northern Ireland .
Lt Gen Frederick Viggers , his predecessor in Baghdad at the time of the 2003 invasion , told the Chilcot inquiry in December : "" We 've got huge experience in this country
â€ “ we 're not using it
and we 're putting amateurs into really , really important positions
and people are getting killed as a result of some of these decisions . ""
He said the invasion of Iraq suffered from a lack of direction from the outset .
Individuals at the highest levels of the government did not seem to have a clear idea of the operation 's direction .
He added : "" I am not talking about the soldiers and commanders and civilians â€ ¦ who did a great job
â€
¦
it 's the intellectual horsepower that drives these things
[ that ] needs better co - ordination . ""
Major General Tim Cross , the only UK military official appointed to help plan the invasion aftermath , delivered a severe indictment of Whitehall 's failures .
"" There were serious concerns about legality and over money , "" he told the Chilcot inquiry .
He described the preparations for the invasion as "" woefully thin "" .
The Chilcot inquiry has yet to say which documents Whitehall submitted to it .
Departments insist decisions to disclose which documents are up to them .
The inquiry is expected to resume public hearings at the end of June or early July ."
"Northumbria police faced fresh questions over their handling of the hunt for Raoul Moat today after it emerged they failed to intercept him hours after he is suspected of shooting a police officer .
Andy McAllister , Moat 's friend , told how the suspected killer visited him at 11.30pm on Saturday night , 21 hours after he was suspected of shooting his former girlfriend , Samantha Stobbart and of killing her new boyfriend Chris Brown .
Police questioned McAllister most of Sunday â€ “ the day PC David Rathband was shot â€ “ and then Moat returned to see him for a second time at 1.30am on Monday morning .
McAllister said he was surprised Northumbria police had failed to mount a surveillance operation at his house in anticipation that he might return . ""
[ Moat ] told me to contact the police
and I rang straight away , "" McAllister told the Sun newspaper , having handed it a letter at Moat 's request . ""
It took more than an hour for them to arrive despite me ringing three or four times .
They knew he had been to my house once â€ “
I would have thought they would have been watching . ""
Northumbria police said it was "" not appropriate "" to discuss whether they had officers observing McAllister 's home .
The force has already referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission after it emerged that officials at Durham prison , where Moat had been serving an 18-week sentence for assaulting a family member , had told police on Friday that Moat intended to cause serious harm to his partner .
Police sources were quoted as saying that Moat had told inmates that he was "" hellbent on revenge "" and "" full of rage "" .
Today villagers in Rothbury , around which police threw a two - mile exclusion zone , complained that police were too slow to release details about the black Lexus car that Moat was thought to be travelling in .
They released its registration at 10.30pm on Monday night , but villagers said the car had been seen in the village for much of the previous afternoon .
A bakery worker on an industrial estate near where the car was found said he even saw the vehicle on Saturday and two men got out , neither of whom fitted Moat 's description .
But he was suspicious enough to note the number plate .
"" I saw it on Saturday morning just 20 yards from where I am now , "" he said .
"" I saw two young men get out of it .
I made a note of the registration number because I wondered if it was illegal camping . ""
Graham Noble , whose Thrum Mill farm is at the centre of the search area , also said police had been slow in putting out the registration of the Lexus because it had been in Rothbury on Monday afternoon .
Information about the presence of the car was passed on to the police early this morning .
A police spokeswoman said : "" This investigation has been progressing continually .
When making decisions about what to release we have to take into account the circumstances we 're dealing with and not release information which could potentially damage an investigation or cause unnecessary risk .
The investigating team felt it appropriate to release the information at this time .
""
Detective chief superintendent Neil Adamson said the force had been "" dealing with a complex , challenging and fast - moving hostage situation "" throughout the investigation .
For several days police believed a white male and an Asian male were "" potentially being controlled by Mr Moat "" .
It is thought the two men arrested today on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder were the same individuals .
"" What I want to stress to the wider public is , I would love to be in a position to let the wider public know what is going on behind the scenes , "" he said .
"" There is a huge amount of effort going on . """
"Thursday 1 July : Raoul Moat , 37 , from Newcastle , is released from Durham prison after serving 18 weeks for assault .

Saturday 3 July : Chris Brown , 29 , Stobbart 's new boyfriend , is shot dead outside her home in Birtley , Gateshead , apparently by Moat .
He also allegedly shoots Stobbart twice through a front window of the house , leaving her critically injured .
Northumbria police launch a manhunt for Moat .
Detective Superintendent Steve Howes says : "" We believe the offender targeted his victims because of a grudge he held against them . ""
Sunday 4 July : PC David Rathband , 42 , is shot in his patrol car and critically injured .
A 49-page letter written by Moat details his grudge against police .
Northumbria police appeal directly to Moat to give himself up .
They reveal he rang officers early that morning to say he believed Stobbart was having an affair with a police officer and was concerned for the well - being of his three children .
Monday 5 July : Moat is suspected of an armed robbery at the Delaval fish bar in Seaton Delaval , near Blyth .
Extra firearms officers from several other northern police forces are brought in to join the hunt for him .
Northumbria police say Stobbart is no longer in a critical condition and has appealed directly to Moat , saying : "" Please give yourself up .
If you still loved me and our baby you would not be doing this . ""
Tuesday 6 July :
The town of Rothbury , Northumberland , is put on lockdown after Moat 's Lexus car is discovered .
Police set up a two - mile exclusion zone in the area and advise residents to stay indoors .
A letter apparently written by Moat emerges in which he declares war on the police and promises not to stop "" until I 'm dead "" .
Police reveal they had been dealing with a hostage situation involving two men said to have been taken at the time of the shooting in Birtley .
But the the pair , Karl Ness , 26 , from Dudley , North Tyneside , and Qhuram Awan , 23 , from Blyth , Northumberland , were later arrested .
Wednesday 7 July : Police recover a tent in which Moat had been sleeping in a secluded area of Rothbury .

Paul Stobbart says : "" Raoul , son , please this has to stop , we do n't want anyone else hurt , nee more son . ""
Thursday 8 July : Ness and Awan appear at Newcastle magistrates court .
Both are remanded in custody accused of helping Moat .

Within moments he is lying on the ground with a sawn - off shotgun pointed to his neck .
He is surrounded by police marksmen and snipers .
Trained negotiators try to talk with Moat .
Saturday 10 July : At 1.10am a single shot is heard .
Moat is rushed to hospital but is pronounced dead on arrival .
Police release a statement saying Moat appears to have shot himself and no shots were fired by officers ."
"A lacklustre Blackburn Rovers were shown up by their Lancashire neighbours Preston North End in a 3 - 0 drubbing tonight .
Two first - half headers from summer signing Paul Hayes , the second of them from a cross delivered by the former Blackburn player Keith Treacy , put Preston in control before Michel Salgado fouled Sean St Ledger and Chris Brown scored Preston 's third from the penalty spot .
There was better fortune for Wolverhampton Wanderers as a successful short trip to Walsall ended in a resounding 4 - 0 win .
Ninteen - year - old striker Ashley Hemmings headed the opener from Greg Halford 's fine cross and Sam Vokes scored twice in five minutes shortly before half - time , first tapping in Scott Malone 's cross and then seizing on defensive confusion to make it 3 - 0 .
Sylvan Ebanks - Blake powered into the box to smash home an emphatic fourth and substitute Kevin Doyle was a handful for the League One club , three times going close .
Wigan Athletic were held to a 1 - 1 draw at Oldham and were forced to come from behind to secure that result , having fallen behind in the first half when Dale Stevens volleyed home superbly after running onto a poor clearance on the edge of Wigan 's 18-yard box .
The equaliser came when Jordi GÃ³mez was clumsily hauled down in the penalty area by Paul Black and got up to convert the penalty ."
"Two alleged accomplices of gunman Raoul Moat appeared before a crown court today via video link to face charges of conspiracy to murder .
Karl Ness , 26 , of Dudley , North Tyneside , and Qhuram Awan , 23 , of Blyth , Northumberland , are accused of helping the former nightclub bouncer target police officers .
The pair are alleged to have been with him when he shot his former girlfriend Samantha Stobbart , who survived , and fatally injured her boyfriend , Chris Brown , in Birtley , Gateshead , this month .
Both men are also charged with obtaining a sawn - off shotgun for Moat before he was released from Durham prison and providing him with supplies while he was on the run .
The defendants were told during a brief hearing at Newcastle crown court they would face trial early in 2011 before a high court judge , with a provisional trial date set for January 24 .
A plea and case management hearing will take place on November 1 .
Kingsley Hyland , prosecuting , asked for a four - week trial and added : "" There 's a real possibility of further defendants being charged . ""
Moat was eventually cornered in the village of Rothbury , Northumberland , where he was involved in a six - hour standoff with police before he apparently shot himself and was twice shot with the controversial Xrep Tasers .
Ness and Awan were arrested in Rothbury four days after Moat went on the run .
No pleas were entered and the judge , Mr Justice Simon , remanded them both in custody until their next court appearance .
Yesterday it emerged that the survival expert Ray Mears had been brought in by police to help them during the seven - day search for Moat .
A Northumbria police spokeswoman confirmed the extraordinary news that Mears had been involved in the manhunt but refused to elaborate .
"" We can confirm Ray Mears did assist in this investigation , as did several other agencies and specialists , "" she said .
Mears , a 46-year - old TV presenter and author of the Outdoor Survival Handbook , helped track Moat 's movements after he fled his makeshift camp near the village of Rothbury , and after the gunman declared "" war "" on police in a rambling letter .
The injured police constable , David Rathband , left hospital yesterday after 17 days of treatment .
He has been blinded in both eyes but is determined to return to work .
Moat 's family have insisted on a second postmortem examination as the first did not mention anything about marks left by the Tasers ."
"Rihanna , the singer who was assaulted last year by her then boyfriend , Chris Brown , has teamed up with rapper Eminem on his latest video , about domestic violence .
The star , 22 , stands outside a burning house singing
"" I love the way you lie "" , while inside actor Megan Fox and Lost star Dominic Monaghan exchange slaps , throw stuff at each other , then start kissing angrily against a wall .
Eminem laments : "" I laid hands on her â€
¦
I 'll never stoop so low again
â€
¦
I guess I do n't know my own strength .
"" The clip ends with the house â€ “ and the lovers â€ “ engulfed in flames .
Rihanna told the celebrity website Access Hollywood : "" It just was authentic .
It was real .
It was believable for us to do a record like that , but it was also something that needed to be done .
He pretty much just broke down the cycle of domestic violence and it touches a lot of people . ""
The video , released online for the rapper 's chart - topping single Love the Way
You Lie , has drawn criticism and praise in equal measure .
Entertainment Weekly made its feelings clear :
"" Eminem 's Love the way You Lie video :
Domestic violence is AWESOME . ""
But a review in Billboard said Rihanna felt the song was something she needed to get out of her system following the "" very public assault at the hands of ex - boyfriend Chris Brown "" .
It went on : "" The clip aims at highlighting the dangers of an abusive relationship and , indirectly , delivers the message that it 's better to walk out before it 's too late . ""
Eminem has often spoken of his stormy relationship with his ex - wife Kim Mathers and many of his older rap songs appear to glorify violence against women .
R&amp;B star Brown was sentenced to 180 days ' community labour and five years ' probation in August 2009 after he pleaded guilty to assaulting Rihanna before the 2009 Grammy awards in February of the same year"
"It 's not just Grinderman who have been accused of plagiarism this week ; Chris Brown is also under fire , with Calvin Harris claiming that the R&amp;B star ripped off his No 1 single , I 'm Not Alone .
The Scottish musician said he "" choked on [ his ] cornflakes "" when Brown 's new single , Yeah 3x , came on the radio while he was eating breakfast . ""
Stealing is still stealing , does n't matter who you are , "" Harris wrote on Twitter . ""
[ Just ] because Chris Brown is an international celebrity does n't make it OK to rip off a guy from UK not many people have heard of . ""
Harris is being modest .
I 'm Not Alone debuted in April 2009 at the top of the UK charts , knocking Lady Gaga 's Poker Face from the peak position .
It also reached No 5 on the European Hot 100 .
The LP it 's taken from , Ready for the Weekend , later crowned the album charts .
I 'm Not Alone is gentler than Yeah 3x , which is inspired by David Guetta 's hard Euro - dance sound .
But there 's certainly a common cadence to both tracks .
"" Happy for people to make their own mind up , "" Harris said , explaining he has no plans to sue Brown or his label . ""
What good would that do ? ""
To many , Brown is still best known for his assault of then - girlfriend Rihanna last year .
But the 21-year - old certainly has his fans , many of whom did not take kindly to Harris 's accusation .
For example , a charming tweeter called @Rosieleto . ""
Your ( sic ) a bag of wank , "" she told Harris .
The DJ soon ran out of patience . ""
Can all these Chris Brown stans stop it now please ?
"" he wrote . ""
Literally getting threatened by 14 year old girls ...
Racist , xenophobic + misguided .
I 'm sure Chris is very proud . ""
Harris also defended his decision to complain over Twitter instead of contacting Brown 's management . ""
More entertaining than doing it behind closed doors , "" he explained .
"" I 'm not trying to present myself in any way or hide my opinions about things in order to gain fans . ""
With almost 300,000 followers on Twitter , Harris probably does n't need any help ."

"Two men were charged today with helping the fugitive gunman Raoul Moat during his seven days on the run from a huge police operation in Northumberland .
The pair were accused of conspiracy to murder and possessing a firearm , after allegedly accompanying Moat when he wounded his former partner Samantha Stobbart and shot dead her new boyfriend Chris Brown in early July .
Karl Ness , 26 , and Qhuram Awan , 23 , are the first of 20 suspected helpers of Moat to appear in court .
They sat in silence during the brief hearing at Newcastle crown court where they were separated in the dock by three security guards .
Neither entered a plea and both were remanded in custody for a trial expected to start in the new year .
Police initially feared that the two men were being held hostage by Moat , after he turned up at Stobbart 's house in Birtley , near Chester - le - Street shortly after his release from Durham jail .
But detectives then arrested them on suspicion of obtaining a sawn - off shotgun for Moat on his release , and getting supplies while he hid from the huge search , which at one stage involved RAF jets with heat - seeking equipment normally used in Afghanistan .
Moat died after emerging near one of his suspected hiding places in a storm drain below Rothbury , on the edge of Northumberland national park .
He shot himself on the bank of the river Coquet after a six - hour standoff with police ended with the firing of two Taser stun guns .
Ness , of Dudley in North Tyneside , appeared in court bearded and with shaved ginger hair , sitting with hisarms folded throughout .
Awan , of Blyth in Northumberland , wore a black T - shirt .
Both spoke only to confirm their personal details .
They were remanded in custody to stand trial on 24 January ."

Odder still , she 's written only five of the 12 tracks , having ceded most of the songwriting responsibility to a crowd of men , including old pal Timbaland .
But the real eyebrow - raiser is that an album ostensibly dedicated to the idea of female empowerment is so full of conventional sex - and - love piffle ( including , of all things , a salacious slow jam with Rihanna 's notorious ex , Chris Brown ) and tributes to her own gorgeousness .

"A woman wept in court as she described the moment gunman Raoul Moat killed her daughter 's boyfriend last summer at the start of his shooting spree .
Lesley Stobbart was at the house in Birtley , Gateshead , when 37-year - old Moat appeared and shot dead Chris Brown .
Moat then critically injured her 22-year - old daughter , Samantha .
Stobbart told Newcastle crown court that she had run upstairs to protect two children when Moat began firing a sawn - off , double - barrelled shotgun .
Stobbart watched from an attic window as Moat , who was 1.9 metres ( 6 ft 4 in ) and a steroid addict , pointed the gun at Brown 's chest and pulled the trigger .
He then turned the weapon on his ex - girlfriend , Samantha , leaving her critically injured .
It was not until Moat ran from the scene that Stobbart realised her daughter had been hurt .
Stobbart said she had warned Moat to stay away from her daughter .
But the former bouncer , who had been released from Durham prison days earlier , was fixated on a reconciliation and had demanded "" a straightener "" â€ “ or fist fight â€ “ with Brown , who was a karate instructor .
He waited for the couple to leave the house before attacking in the early hours of 3 July .
Stobbart told the jury : "" I shouted : ' You bastard , you bastard .
Why have you shot him ? '
Then I ran upstairs to get the children .
"" I put them in the attic and I told them not to come out of the attic no matter what they did . ""
She heard a second shot and looked out the attic window .
"" I could see Chris lying on the grass .
Then Raoul shot him again .
I did not know Samantha had been shot at the time .
I went down to see where everyone was
and she was lying on the floor . ""
While waiting for the couple to come out of the house , Moat had sent a text message to a friend which read : "" They are slagging me off .
My suffering is funny apparently .
We 'll see who 's laughing . ""
Under cross - examination , Samantha said she had been terrified that Moat would "" flip his lid "" when he was released from prison .
She had said Brown was a police officer in an attempt to ward off trouble , she added .
Anticipating the confrontation , she had asked Brown to stay the night at his own flat on the night of the murder , but he refused .
She told police investigators : "" I was very worried .
Frightened , really scared .
At one point I was absolutely petrified as to how he would react on his release .
"" I expected he would flip his lid and that there would be trouble ; he 'd come looking for Chris .
"" I had told him the relationship was at an end but he would not have it .
He would not take no for an answer . ""
But "" never in a million years "" did she think he would coming looking for her with a gun .
Mother and daughter were giving evidence at the trial of two men alleged to have been the willing accomplices of Moat during his rampage .
Karl Ness , 26 , and Qhuram Awan , 23 , claim they were being held hostage by Moat , who also shot and blinded an unarmed traffic officer , David Rathband , after going hunting for police officers .
Ness is alleged to have been with Moat on the night he shot the couple , while Awan is alleged to have helped the pair afterwards and driven Moat to the junction of the A1 and A69 where he shot Rathband .
Ness , from Dudley , North Tyneside , denies murdering Brown .
Both defendants deny conspiracy to murder , the attempted murder of Rathband , a firearms offence and the robbery of a Northumberland fish and chip shop .
After going on the run for almost a week , Moat killed himself following a standoff with police in Rothbury , Northumberland ."
"A friend of Raoul Moat accused of helping his murderous rampage told a court of the moment he was taken hostage at gunpoint .
Karl Ness , 26 , denies the prosecution claim that he was a "" willing accomplice "" of the killer gunman , who shot his ex - partner , executed her new boyfriend , then 24 hours later , blinded unarmed police officer David Rathband , in July .
Ness believed Moat had killed himself rather than seriously injuring Samantha Stobbart and killing Chris Brown that night , he told a jury at Newcastle crown court .
Hours after the double - shooting , Moat turned up at the home of a relative of Ness 's girlfriend in Newcastle 's West End .
Ness and co - accused Qhuram Awan , 23 , were summoned .
Ness , giving evidence in his defence , said Moat was waving a gun around in the kitchen .
With him was Tara Collins , Ness 's girlfriend .
Moat explained in detail how he had blasted Brown three times , then shot Stobbart .
Ness said the killer claimed he had meant only to cause her a "" surface wound "" so she would receive compensation .
Paul Sloan QC , defending , asked : "" What was the atmosphere like ? "" "" Horrible , you could cut it with a knife , "" Ness replied .
Moat then ordered Ness and Awan to buy two phones and fill Awan 's car with petrol , the defendant claimed , while Collins stayed in the house with the ex - doorman .
Sloan asked : "" Why did n't you take the opportunity of alerting the authorities to what was going on ? ""
Ness replied : "" I would be putting my girlfriend at risk . ""
After the two returned from buying the phones , Ness believed Moat would drive off alone in Awan 's black Lexus .
Instead , Moat ordered Ness and Awan to go with him , he told the court .
Ness said : "" He told me and Awan we were going with him . ""
Sloan asked : "" Did you feel you had any choice in the matter ? ""
"" He had a gun in his hand , "" Ness replied . ""
He told Tara not to go to the police or he would kill her . ""
The three men then left the house , the court heard .
Earlier , Ness told of his shock when Moat produced a gun for the first time .
He was with his friend in a van heading to Birtley , Gateshead , where Stobbart lived .
Ness told the court Moat had been arguing with his ex on the phone , and things were heated .
Moat had punched the steering wheel , he said .
"" He put his hands between his legs on the floor and pulled out a gun . ""
I was speechless .
I was stuck , I could n't get out . ""
Later , Ness stayed in the van while Moat hid outside the property where Stobbart was socialising .
Eventually he heard a shot .
"" I thought he had killed himself , "" Ness said .
"" I heard a lot of screaming .
I broke down
, I was shaking , I was crying . ""
Ness drove off from the scene , he told the court .
Ness denies murdering Chris Brown .
Both men deny conspiracy to murder , attempted murder , a firearms offence and robbing a takeaway .
The case was adjourned and continues on Wednesday ."
"Chris Brown is certainly having a busy 2011 .
Last month the American R&amp;B singer was No 2 in the UK chart , having appeared as the "" featured artist "" on Chipmunk 's hit single Champion .
In recent weeks , he 's also guested on records by Diddy and TI , and he even teamed up with pipsqueak du jour
Justin Bieber on a song destined for Brown 's own new album .
And , speaking of the album â€ “ modestly titled FAME â€ “ expectations are high .
Fans have left scores of gushing anticipatory comments on his blog , Mechanical Dummy , the gist of which is conveyed by a message from someone called Team Breezy Freak : "" I ca n't wait for FAME .
I love you , Chris , I love you sooo damn much , you 're my life and my absolute everything . ""
All told , it 's hard to believe that this is the same Chris Brown who , just two years ago , was persona non grata in the music business after being convicted of assaulting his then - girlfriend , Rihanna .
Now , despite still being on probation ( he also completed community service and a domestic - violence programme ) , he 's been accepted back into the industry fold as if nothing had ever happened .
At this rate , there 's every likelihood his career will regain its pre - assualt momentum , when he was being tipped as the all - singing , all - dancing successor to Usher .
Brown is feeling so confident these days that he 's given his album
the magnanimous sub - title Forgive All My Enemies .
Pretty rich , you might say â€ “ yet his confidence is understandable , given other artists ' warmth toward him : "" Whatever happened in his personal life is nothing to do with me , "" Chipmunk said recently .
"" I think he 's probably one of the best singers and dancers . ""
How did he lose his pariah status so quickly ?
Even for America , a country that relishes seeing tarnished heroes return triumphant , his rehabilitation has happened indecently fast .
J Dakar , a cultural writer on the US - based urban - music site Concrete Loop , suggests two things were responsible .
The first were high - profile gestures of remorse , such as the release of a song called Changed Man several months after the offence , and his breaking down in tears during an appearance at America 's BET awards last September . ""
[ The BET awards were ] a real turning point , "" he says .
"" Then came TI 's Get Back Up [ a duet with the now - incarcerated rapper in which both apologised for letting fans down ] .
Pretty soon , other artists no longer saw him as someone to avoid at all costs , but to embrace , because his fans , in turn , would be there to embrace him wholeheartedly , "" he says , via email .
Second , suggests Dakar , the public decided that however reprehensible his crime , it did n't merit lifetime banishment . ""
He was 19 at the time , so a lot of people would n't want to see this kid 's life messed up over a single stupid mistake .
On the most basic level , no man should ever hit a woman , but humans make mistakes . ""
Like R Kelly , whose career was only fleetingly affected when he was charged with ( and eventually acquitted of ) producing child pornography , Brown is also benefiting from a fervent fanbase who 've chosen to ignore the fact that their hero has feet of clay . ""
His teenage fans really stuck by him , "" says a British urban - music executive , who wants to remain anonymous .
"" They suggested he was provoked â€ “ they were saying things on the blogs like : ' Rihanna must have done something to deserve it . ' ""
Woefully , it 's female rather than male fans who tend to take this view ; in Brown 's defence , he 's never blamed Rihanna for his actions .
London - based publicist Mark Borkowski , who has worked with similarly compromised celebrities , says Brown 's comeback is likely to succeed because he 's used a time - tested PR strategy .
"" The classic tactic is to go off the radar for a while , then come back penitent .
With Brown , you draw him back through an audience who possibly does n't have the same view of his conduct as the [ mainstream ] media , then you break it out of the urban media . ""
But , Borkowsi says , all the strategies in the world wo n't work without one extra ingredient : "" The star has to have the talent , the ability , to make the investment worthwhile . ""
For better or worse , the music industry has decided Brown , regardless of his crimes , does have that talent .
FAME is released on 21 March on RCA"
"We 've had the remorse and crooned contrition , so the dubiously - titled F.A.M.E ( forgive all my enemies ) is ostensibly an attempt to move on from the storm caused by Brown 's assault on ex - girlfriend Rihanna in 2009 .
But he still sounds hamstrung by a fear of trying anything too edgy .
The nifty duel between Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes is an anomaly .
This record 's syrupy mid - section makes good on his desire to write "" songs that your grandma can love "" , while Justin Bieber duet "" Next To You "" will appeal only to your tweenie sister ."
"Chris Brown "" went ballistic "" , reportedly trashing his TV dressing - room after an interviewer asked him repeatedly about his 2009 attack on then - girlfriend Rihanna .
The r'n'b star stormed from Good Morning America 's New York studios , according to sources from the network , calling off a performance â€ “ and tearing off his shirt .
Brown was scheduled to perform two songs on the Monday morning broadcast , as well as speaking with anchor Robin Roberts about his new album , F.A.M.E.
However Roberts insisted on asking him questions about the February 2009 domestic assault .
After pleading guilty to the attack , Brown completed a 52-week domestic violence course and remains on probation .
"" I 'm past that in my life , "" Brown said , on - camera .
"" I 've been focusing on this album . ""
But when he explained the meaning of his album title â€ “ it stands for Forgiving All My Enemies â€ “ Roberts pushed again .
"" You can understand how some people ...
It was very serious what you went through and what happened , "" she said .
"" This album is what I want to talk about , "" Brown snapped .
"" Not what happened two years ago . ""
Although Brown finished the interview , he reportedly declined to perform a second song .
Instead he stormed off set , according to the New York Post , barking , "" That was n't cool , man ! ""
The 21-year - old shut himself in his dressing - room and allegedly tore the room apart . ""
He went crazy , "" a source told E!. ""
He smashed a chair into a window and that glass is so thick , people heard shattering and security was called ...
It was to the point where people were scared . ""
Glass from the broken window fell on to 43rd Street and Broadway below .
Police were not called , but Brown left in a hurry ; he emerged from the building bare - chested and fuming .
"" I 'm so over people bringing this past shit up , "" he wrote â€ “ and later deleted â€ “ on Twitter . ""
Yet we praise Charlie Sheen and other celebs for there bullshit ( sic ) .
"" The singer later cancelled a scheduled interview on MTV .
Good Morning America 's parent network defended the interview in a statement .
"" As always , we ask questions that are relevant and newsworthy , and that 's what we did in this interview with Mr Brown , "" ABC wrote .
Last month , a judge in California softened the restraining order preventing Brown from contacting his ex - girlfriend .
The judge warned Brown not to harass Rihanna , from whom he had been ordered to stay at least 50 yards away ."
"It 's hard to think of a more self - referential genre than hip - hop â€ “ all that sanctimonious opining about fame , "" the game "" and the rapper 's flow .
Now that the most recent crop of UK rappers â€ “ Chipmunk , Tinie Tempah â€ “ are following up hit albums ,
the navel - gazing can only get worse .
Chipmunk ( aka Jahmaal Fyffe ) has turned 20 and now has international stars such as Chris Brown cropping up on his songs ( "" Champion "" , a No 2 hit ) .
Fyffe can ride a beat and spits with panache on "" Foul "" and "" Pray for Me "" , easily the best things on here .
But elsewhere , there are precious few real insights , which is surprising , given Fyffe was pulled off promo duties a couple of years back for posting suicidal tweets ."
"It may be two years since DJ / producer / sometime vocalist Calvin Harris released his last album , Ready For The Weekend , but his sound has been everywhere of late .
Recent top 10 singles from JLS and Chris Brown have both featured what we will call , for legal reasons , "" echoes "" of Harris 's single
I 'm Not Alone , and you ca n't move for other pop singles featuring similarly huge , 90s - esque house riffs .
Following a support slot opening for Rihanna and a recent falling out with Katy Perry regarding cancelled dates on her tour , he 's turned his sights on another female pop star , with Kelis adding her husky tones to Bounce , the first single from his as - yet - unnamed third album .
Opening with a pinging keyboard riff and Kelis intoning "" bounce "" , it soon morphs into a hands - in - the - air - ideally - holding - a - glow - stick dance monster , with Kelis 's effortless cool keeping it just the right side of parody ."
"From his 1994 debut Illmatic to last year 's collaboration with Damian Marley , Nas has become one of the world 's most revered rappers .
However , his choice of collaborators is sometimes questionable , with previous singles featuring dubious guest vocalists ( Chris Brown , will.i.am ) or odd production mismatches ( Mark Ronson , Stargate ) .
But when he gets it right , as he does on Nasty , the first single from forthcoming album
Life Is Good , there 's a spark and energy that sets him apart .
Over double - quick beats supplied by producer Salaam Remi , Nas barely pauses for breath as he delivers a run of verses ( he even continues when the music stops ) .
There 's no chorus , no guests , just Nas 's wordplay and a man revitalised ."
"Two years after pleading guilty to assaulting his then - girlfriend Rihanna , Chris Brown is to star in a romantic comedy .
The R&amp;B singer has been cast in Think Like a Man , a film adaptation of a self - help book by comedian Steve Harvey .
The original title of Harvey 's book was Act Like a Lady ,
Think Like a Man :
What Men Really Think About Love , Relationships , Intimacy and Commitment .
Published in 2009 , it briefly bumped Twilight author Stephenie Meyer from the top of the US bestseller list .
While Harvey 's tome is non - fiction , the movie version will transform his advice into a quirky love story starring Brown and actor Gabrielle Union .
Brown , 22 , attacked Rihanna on 8 February 2009 .
She suffered heavy bruising and a "" mouthful of blood "" , according to police reports .
Brown was later sentenced to five years ' probation , a year of domestic violence counselling and six months ' community service .
"" I am ashamed of and sorry for what happened that night
and I wish I could relive that moment and change things , but I ca n't , "" he said in September 2009 .
Since then , the R&amp;B singer 's career has slowly but surely recovered .
A new album , released this year , topped the US charts and reached No 10 in the UK .
Brown recently performed on Dancing with the Stars and the Today Show .
After the latter programme was criticised for booking him , the singer â€ “ who has undergone anger management classes
â€ “ lashed out on Twitter . ""
[ People ] are upset at the fact that the Today Show actually focuses on talent instead of an almost 3-year old incident ! "" he wrote . ""
Running bogus and pointless stories do n't matter !
My fans prove that everyday and the haters just look old as fuck !
I keep my head high and my middle finger higher ! ""
In March , Brown smashed up his dressing room , "" going ballistic "" after he was asked about Rihanna in an interview with Good Morning America .
He claimed he was "" just letting off steam "" .
Think Like a Man is due in April next year ."
"Superstar French DJ and producer David Guetta 's extraordinary global success is based on giving his fans precisely what they want , when they want it .
So there are few surprises on this behemoth of a double album , suitably grandiose in sound and scale â€ “ hulking synths , thudding four - to - the - floor beats and precipitous drops â€ “ but predictably stunted in creativity and musical ambition .
Guetta 's trademark union of stadium trance and American R&amp;B is represented in a glittering array of bling - encrusted collaborations ( Snoop Dogg , Akon , Chris Brown ) but they struggle to impose any distinctive personality on the overall mood of relentless rictus - grin - inducing euphoria ."
"The inquest jurors considering the death of the fugitive gunman Raoul Moat would have to "" try the impossible "" and forget what they had heard about the case , a coroner said on Monday .
Moat shot and injured his former partner Samantha Stobbart and killed her boyfriend Chris Brown before going on the run for a week last year .
He shot and blinded an unarmed police officer , David Rathband .
He died after a standoff with police in Rothbury , Northumberland , in July last year during which a controversial new Taser was fired by police .
The jury , sworn in on Monday at Newcastle crown court , will consider whether the Taser led the 37-year - old former nightclub doorman to shoot himself .
Newcastle coroner David Mitford told the jurors : "" The publicity was so great it would be impossible for anybody not to know what happened , to some extent , in the summer of last year .
You will recall there was a very substantial number of police officers involved , not from just Northumbria , but others included from many , many forces and one of those was West Yorkshire police . ""
He added : "" It will not have escaped your attention that there were some weapons called Tasers used on the night in question .
Those Tasers were supplied to Northumbria police by a firm called Pro - Tec Limited . ""
He asked the jurors to try "" the impossible "" and forget what they had already heard about the case .
Before the jurors were sworn in , Mitford said he wanted to ensure they were not familiar with any of the witnesses and read out a long list of names .
The coroner said Moat 's death was confirmed at Newcastle general hospital on 10 July last year . ""
Mr Moat was a 37-year - old man , single , with children .
He met his death when he was effectively detained , "" Mitford told the jury .
"" There have been lots of theories and conclusions drawn , some of which may have been accurate , some of which may not . ""
The inquest would focus on the events in Rothbury , he said .
There would be questions about weapons used , how police managed the incident , how officers dealt with the deceased and how he acted , the jury was told .
But it would first hear why so many officers were involved in the "" manhunt "" , the coroner said .
Barristers for the Moat family , the chief constable of Northumbria , West Yorkshire police officers and Pro - Tec were in court , Mitford said .
The inquest is expected to take four weeks ."
"A tape recording of the conversation between Raoul Moat and his girlfriend that prompted his murderous rampage following his release from prison was played to an inquest jury on Monday .
In the recording , Moat reacted angrily when Samantha Stobbart told him their relationship was over .
Within days of his release from Durham prison , Moat shot and injured 22-year - old Stobbart , the mother of his child , and killed her new boyfriend , 29-year - old Chris Brown .
Moat asked Stobbart : "" What 's wrong ? ""
"" It 's over "" , she replies .
"" Over what ? "" he asks her .
"" I 've had enough "" she says .
"" Of what ? ""
Moat says .
"" Everything "" she replies .
Moat says : "" We had one argument the other day .
Let 's not get all silly about it . ""
He complains that "" everybody is getting on my case "" and that he is getting "" picked on "" .
The conversation ends with the phone being slammed down .
In a second call , Moat tells Stobbart : "" You are the only person I have ever cared about .
I ca n't have you out of my life .
I 'm going to go crazy , man . ""
She tells him she has met a new man who is "" a lot younger than you "" .
Superintendent Jim Napier , of Northumbria police , said : "" It is clear from the evidence that Moat 's break - up with Samantha Stobbart was the catalyst for his murderous acts . ""
Moat , 37 , died following a six - hour stand - off with police marksmen in July 2010 after a rampage during which he shot and blinded PC David Rathband , an unarmed officer , as he sat in his police car .
Moat shot himself in the head after the stand - off at Rothbury , Northumberland , during which police twice fired XREP Tasers that had not been approved by the Home Office .
The 11 members of the jury sworn in at Newcastle crown court will decide whether the Taser rounds contributed to the former nightclub doorman 's death .
Moat had been serving an 18-week prison sentence for assault when the call was made in June 2010 .
Police retrieved three recorded calls from the prison during their investigation .
The coroner , David Mitford , told jurors that an inquest was needed because "" Mr Moat met his death when he was effectively detained "" .
He added : "" It will not have escaped your attention that there were some weapons called Tasers used on the night in question .

"A recording of a phone call from Raoul Moat was played to an inquest jury in which he warned his girlfriend that he was "" going to go crazy "" after she told him she wanted him out of her life .
The call between Samantha Stobbart and the 37-year - old bouncer was made when Moat was in prison and police said it was a catalyst for his murderous rampage , Newcastle crown court heard , on the first day of the inquest .
Within days of his release from Durham prison , Moat shot and injured 22-year - old Stobbart , the mother of his child , and killed her new boyfriend , 29-year - old Chris Brown .
The jury also heard a later call from Moat to police in which he said he was hunting down officers and was "" not coming in alive "" .
That call , to an emergency call handler , came after he had attacked Stobbart and Brown in Birtley , Tyne and Wear , in July 2010 , and shortly before he shot unarmed Pc David Rathband , blinding him , as he sat in his police car .
He claimed he had taken two hostages and would kill them and any police officer who approached him .
Moat expressed remorse for injuring his girlfriend , but added that he had been "" stitched up "" by the police for a number of years .
Moat had thought , incorrectly , that Brown was a police officer ; it was what Stobbart had told him in an attempt to keep him away from her .
He told the call handler : "" Now , my girlfriend has been having an affair behind my back with one of your officers .
This gentleman that I shot last night , the karate instructor ...
You bastards have been on to me , right , for years .
You have hassled us , harassed us , you just wo n't leave us alone .
"" I went straight six years ago when I met her and I have tried my best to have a normal life and you just wo n't let up .
You wo n't leave us alone for five minutes .
I ca n't drive down the street without the blue lights flashing . ""
The call continued : "" But the fact of the matter is I 'm not coming in alive ...
You wanted me to kill myself
but I 'm going to give you a chance because I 'm hunting for officers now
, right ? ""
The call handler said : "" No .
Please do n't do that .
We do n't want any more killing , all right ? ""
Moat hung up .
The earlier recording was made in June 2010 , while Moat was serving an 18-week prison sentence for assault .
Police retrieved three recorded calls from the prison during their investigation .
In one of the calls , Moat asked Stobbart : "" What 's wrong ? ""

He added : "" It will not have escaped your attention that there were some weapons called Tasers used on the night in question .

The jury was also read six letters in which Moat indicated he might take his own life .
They were addressed to his former girlfriend , to social services , his business partner Karl Ness and other friends .
The letters outlined the problems in his life and told his friends what to do with his belongings .
Superintendent Napier said the letters found in a search indicated Moat was "" suicidal or had been suicidal in the past "" and the letters appeared to be prepared by Moat and intimated he intended to take his own life .
Napier said officers also found a noose in the property near the loft hatch , he told the jury .
Officers found fishing weights and material that suggested they could be converted to ammunition . ""
Napier said : "" Following the shooting of Pc Rathband and Moat 's declaration he was hunting for officers , this search developed on to a scale we have never really experienced in Northumbria police and I understand seldom experienced before in the UK . ""
Moat left a note with a friend that said : "" I 'm a killer and a maniac but I ai n't a coward .
I 'm not on the run , I will keep killing police until I am dead .

"Raoul Moat 's elder brother told an inquest he believes police made a mistake in not allowing him to speak to the fugitive gunman during a stand - off in which he died .
Within days of Moat 's release from Durham prison in July last year , he shot and injured 22-year - old Samantha Stobbart , the mother of his child , and killed her new boyfriend , 29-year - old Chris Brown .
He also shot and blinded PC David Rathband , an unarmed officer sitting in a patrol car .
Moat had been on the run for a week before the six - hour stand - off with officers in Rothbury , Northumberland , in which he died .
He shot himself after he was twice Tasered by police .
Officers used an untested XREP Taser that had not been approved by the Home Office .
On the second day of the inquest in Newcastle on Tuesday , Angus Moat , a 41-year - old tax officer who has a different birth father but the same mother as the 37-year - old bouncer , said he had spoken to a senior officer about becoming a third party intervener alongside the police negotiators .
He admitted he had not spoken to his brother for seven or eight years , as they had drifted apart .
Angus Moat suggested police should have thrown Raoul a mobile telephone if he was not able to speak face - to - face .
He said he "" should have been involved "" in attempts to "" talk Raoul down "" .
Angus Moat said during the week his brother was on the run , their mother had spoken to the press and said Raoul would be better off dead , but he had not agreed .
He described their mother as "" severely mentally ill and incapable of being a parent "" , as he said she had bipolar disorder .
When asked during the inquest at Newcastle crown court if his brother could have been similarly afflicted , he replied : "" Most definitely .
I think he had an undiagnosed case of bipolar brought on by stress , being in prison , losing his business and his home . ""
He said his brother had attempted suicide in 1999 by taking a drug overdose and had been treated in hospital .
Asked by John Beggs , a barrister acting for Northumbria police , if his comments stemmed from the fact that Raoul Moat did not have any close contact with family members over seven or eight years , he said : "" It is a factor , but not principally . ""
He told the inquest jury : "" I 'd have told him to think of his kids . ""
Raoul thought everybody in his own family was against him and I wanted to show him that was not the case .
"" I thought if I could speak to him it could change the way he was feeling and the way he would act .
I thought the presence of some of his family members might change things . ""
He said Raoul responded to aggression and threat , "" but he also responded to kindness and friendship "" .
He added : "" I thought it could potentially be the end of my brother 's life
and I did not want that to happen .
I knew he would be in a lot of trouble
but I did not want him to die .
My view was that going to prison for the rest of his life would be better than death . ""
The inquest earlier heard the gunman had said he would "" take the shoot - out "" rather than go back to jail .
He left a message on a dictating machine three or four days before he was cornered by police marksmen .
In the message , he described losing the only two people who mattered to him â€ “ his grandmother and his former girlfriend , Stobbart .
He said : "" Just take the shoot - out and everybody 's happy . ""
Superintendent Jim Napier of Northumbria police , in charge of the criminal investigation into Moat 's rampage , said the message had affected the way in which the stand - off was handled .
"" It is a personal disappointment I never got to see Mr Moat account for his crimes , "" he told the hearing .
The inquest had heard that while in prison , Moat had warned Stobbart he would "" go crazy "" after she ended the relationship .
Police say this was the catalyst for his murderous rampage .
The 11 members of the jury will focus on the events on 9 and 10 July , when Moat was found .
There will be questions about weapons used , how police managed the incident , how officers dealt with the dead man and how he acted , the jury was told .
Among the questions to be addressed are whether the XREP Taser should have been deployed .
The hearing continues ."
"Raoul Moat said he prefer to "" take the shoot - out "" rather than go back to jail , an inquest has heard .
Within days of his release from Durham prison , Moat shot and injured 22-year - old Samantha Stobbart , the mother of his child , and killed her new boyfriend , 29-year - old Chris Brown .
He also blinded PC David Rathband , who was unarmed and sitting in a patrol car .
Moat
â€ “ who became the subject of a huge manhunt â€ “ died following a six - hour stand - off with police marksmen .
He shot himself in the head after the stand - off at Rothbury , Northumberland , during which police twice fired XREP Tasers that had not been approved by the Home Office .
The 11 members of the jury at Newcastle crown court will decide whether the Taser rounds contributed to the former nightclub doorman 's death .
Moat made the claim in a message recorded on a dictating machine three or four days before he was cornered by armed officers in Rothbury in July 2010 .
In the message , the 37-year - old said he had lost the only two people who mattered to him â€ “ his grandmother and Stobbart â€ “ and said if he returned to jail he would have "" nothing to come out to "" and a shoot - out would mean "" everybody 's happy "" .
Superintendent Jim Napier , of Northumbria police , who led the investigation , read the message out on the second day of the hearing .
He told John Beggs , cross - examining for Northumbria police , that the recordings revealed Moat considered himself to have lost the only two adults he cared about .
In the message , Moat said : "" If I went to jail now , I could hack it because I have lost everything
and I have nothing to come out to .
I have come out and got my vengeance .
I have set Sam up for life , financially at least .
But it is not really what I want .
It would be a waste of a life and a waste of the taxpayer 's money .
Just take the shoot - out and everybody 's happy . ""
Napier said he took it to be an indication that Moat was contemplating provoking a shoot - out with police .
He said this knowledge informed the police reaction to the gunman when he was cornered .
In a tape played at the inquest , Moat said he was "" not too fussed "" about not killing PC Rathband .
He said : "" I was going to go along and finish him .
He got two shots â€ “
that 's enough â€ “ and at the end of the day he is looking a bit of a mess . ""
Napier conceded that Moat was not a stupid man , saying : "" If he had been stupid , he would never have avoided detection and arrest , and he worked very hard to do that for five or six days . ""
Moat threatened to kill members of the public if he read any more "" lies "" in the media about him , the inquest heard .
Napier said : "" This was the first time he had turned his anger towards innocent members of the public . ""
That accounted for the large number of armed police from around the country who joined the hunt for the fugitive , he said .
In another recording , Moat admitted : "" My kids are going to be disgraced for the rest of their life for what their father did .
I am disgraced .
All the people I cared about are going to suffer through this . ""
Moat said he could easily shoot himself , but "" I want to kill as many police officers as I can "" .
He distanced himself from Derrick Bird , who had killed 13 people largely at random in Cumbria just weeks before , saying Bird had "" gone round shooting old ladies in bobble hats "" .
Beggs said Moat was "" relishing his war with the police "" , referring to when Moat said : "" No one has ever taken on the police before , no one has been daft enough .
One thing I have noticed , when I have been out and about , I was literally right under your nose .
It does give us a little bit of satisfaction now after all these years of pissing me about , you are treating me seriously . ""
Napier said : "" He was relishing the havoc he was creating . ""
The officer agreed he would have preferred Moat to be arrested than to end up dead , and said it was a personal disappointment he never got to see him account for his crimes .
The jury was shown video clips of the scene in Rothbury when Moat was cornered .
The inquest had heard he told his girlfriend he was going to go crazy after she ended their relationship .
The inquest is expected to continue for four weeks ."
"The fugitive gunman Raoul Moat took his own life after police fired an unapproved Taser at him , an inquest jury decided on Tuesday .
The jury concluded that the armed officers had behaved properly during the six - hour stand - off with the 37-year - old former bouncer at Rothbury , Northumberland , in July 2010 .
Moat had been on the run for a week after shooting his ex - girlfriend Samantha Stobbart , 22 and killing her new partner Chris Brown , 29 .
He went on to shoot and blind an unarmed traffic officer , PC David Rathband , after declaring "" war '' on police .
The three - week inquest at Newcastle crown court had been told that Moat was hit by an experimental Taser round fired by marksmen who believed he was about to kill himself .
The Taser had no effect , aand Moat shot himself in the head .
The inquest was told that Moat had likened himself to King Kong while on the run .
The jurors spent five hours considering their verdict .
Summing up , the coroner David Mitford said the jury should consider either a verdict of suicide or an open verdict .
He told them they had to answer five questions linked to whether police should have used the untested XRep X12 Taser that had not been approved by the Home Office .
It had been the first time it had been used in the UK during a police operation .
The coroner said the jury had to be "" satisfied so you are sure "" before returning a verdict of suicide .
An Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) investigation into the operation found no evidence of misconduct by officers .
The IPCC looked at the period from the sighting of Moat until his death , including strategy and tactics and the deployment of XRep Tasers .
It concluded that there may be "" some learning "" for Northumbria Police from the investigation but there was no evidence any police officers had committed misconduct .
One area the jury had to consider was whether the use of Tasers was appropriate .
It found no evidence of improper behaviour by police .
Moat 's brother Angus told the inquest that he should have been allowed to negotiate with his brother , but this request was turned down by police .
He said Raoul responded to aggression and threat "" but he also responded to kindness and friendship "" .
The inquest had been told that Moat has said he would "" take the shoot - out "" rather than go back to jail .
He left a message on a dictating machine three or four days before he was cornered by police marksmen .
In it , he described losing the only two people who mattered to him â€ “ his grandmother and his former girlfriend .
Moat 's brother Angus told the inquest that Raoul had attempted suicide in 1999 and was treated in hospital for a drug overdose .
While on the run , their mother had spoken to the press and said Raoul would be better off dead , but Angus Moat had disagreed .
He said she had bipolar disorder and was "" severely mentally ill and incapable of being a parent "" .
He said if he had been able to speak to his brother , he thought he would be able to change the way he was feeling and the way he would act ."

Australia / New Zealand ""
Traditionally the cheapest time to travel to Australia is May / June , "" says Joel Saunders , managing director of Austravel ( austravel.com ) , "" and there are some extremely competitive fares if you book right now .
A return to Perth or Melbourne with Cathay Pacific for April - June costs from Â£699 , as opposed to more than Â£1,000 if booked later .
If you 're looking to travel towards the end of the year , aim for September to November , rather than the peak times of December or January , when the same flight will cost around Â£1,500 . ""
For New Zealand , fares are lowest around May - June , but sometimes you can cut the cost by flying on a secondary , more indirect route .

"There was no MIA - style finger of discontent at this year 's Grammy awards , as reverence , not controversy , ruled the evening .
Speeches were humble , outfits were demure ( even Lady Gaga 's ) and there were few , if any , surprise winners .
Adele claimed easy ownership of the night with her return to the stage after five months ' enforced medical leave , earning a much - deserved standing ovation for a thundering performance of Rolling in the Deep .
The only real controversy was a surprising lack of one , with Chris Brown not only being invited back to the ceremony without a fuss â€ “
he missed his 2009 slot , having assaulted his then - girlfriend Rihanna â€ “ but winning best R&amp;B album and getting two performances in .
Sasha Pasulka wrote an excellent blogpost in anticipation of his appearance , raging at statements from the Grammys executive producer Ken Ehrlich such as : "" If you 'll note , he has not been on the Grammys for the past few years and it may have taken us a while to kind of get over the fact that we were the victim of what happened .
"" Which , let 's face it , beggars belief .
Despite the Grammys seeing nothing wrong with welcoming Brown back there was considerable ire vented on Twitter , with many objecting to the sight of a tentative standing ovation for him and its treatment as some sort of redemption narrative .
On hand to wash away all sins was Nicki Minaj , who brought a pet Pope with her to help absolve , or maybe crucify , her alter ego Roman .
This involved a barking medley of Oh Come All Ye Faithful , Roman 's Revenge
, I Feel Pretty , Somewhere Over the Rainbow , Grandma We Love You and How Much
Is That Doggy in the Window ( some of these may not have featured , but frankly , it was hard to tell ) .
With Lady Gaga failing to walk the red carpet , and having the audacity to show up in something resembling clothing rather than something you 'd find in a butcher 's , it felt as if Minaj was staking a claim to the throne of eccentric pop stardom .
With most of the evening given over to necessarily unshowy tributes â€ “ to Etta James , Glen Campbell and , of course , Whitney Houston ( whose signature song , I Will Always Love You , was performed by Jennifer Hudson )
â€ “ it would n't have been appropriate to have more than one lot of Gaga - enabled antics on stage .
But I was pleased she attempted it .
Adele stole the night with class , grace and talent , but I 'm all in favour of a healthy dose of trashy theatrics to balance things out ."
"The news that Rihanna has recorded two new tracks with the man who beat her up a few years ago is , to me , profoundly depressing .
But sadly her decision is more the norm than the exception .
Rihanna may be telling the truth when saying it was the first and only time Chris Brown ever laid hands on her , but judging by the charity Refuge 's figures saying that , on average , a woman is assaulted 35 times before her first call to the police , that would not be the normal experience .
But does the music industry , in which they both work , have duty of care in a situation such as this ?
Years ago , I found out a pop artist and DJ friend of mine was hitting his girlfriend , after I asked her about the bruises on her arms . ""
He came home late , and I was nagging so he threw me against the bathroom wall , "" she said , as if she 'd somehow been complicit .
She only told me after making me promise not to confront him .
I said I 'd have to do something if he ever did it again , and she assured me he would n't .
After they moved abroad , I 'd only talk to her sporadically
( I wrote off my friendship with him ) .
Sometimes she 'd say he was better , after having stopped drinking , other times she 'd tell me about him punching her in the face for "" nagging "" , then telling her to stay home when he went out to party â€
“ "" Not even make up would cover that black eye . ""
After years she must have realised he did n't deserve one more last chance , because she left him .
He went on to marry someone else , and one night he beat his new wife up in public .
After years of violence , it was n't the victim who reported him , but the people who witnessed it .
Though his wife was so severely hurt she had to be taken to hospital and required 11 stitches to her head , she testified in his defence , saying she 'd inflicted all the injuries to herself after having a "" panic attack "" and that her husband was just trying to "" calm her down "" .
He was held for a month , but even though his previous girlfriend finally spoke out and testified he had beaten her too he managed to get his conviction reduced from GBH to "" a mild assault "" â€ “ and went on to sue the state for having treated him with indignity and for loss of work .
He was paid Â£4,000 in compensation .
Though the legal system may have let him off lightly , people in the entertainment industry were not as forgiving , with the vast majority of people refusing to work with him or hire him .
Eventually he and his wife moved countries .
In another example , I remember a publisher telling me how a songwriter he was trying to sign refused to sign unless they got rid of a guy who 'd been accused of sexual assault numerous times ( they did drop the guy in the end ) .
But for Brown it 's business as usual .
He was n't dropped by his label , Sony â€ “
no , he 's winning Grammy awards , and sharing the stage and recording duets with the victim of his violent attack .
I do n't blame Rihanna for accepting this .
She 's displaying the same behaviour as the two women my former friend was abusing .
And , just like their abuser , Brown appears to feel aggrieved and victimised , judging by his tweet after the Grammys : "" HATE ALL U WANT BECUZ
I GOT A GRAMMY
Now !
That 's the ultimate FUCK OFF ! ""
But if Rihanna does n't have the strength to do so , the entertainment industry , including Brown 's label , needs to make clear that what he did is not OK , in order to protect her â€ “ just like the people who reported the artist to the police after seeing him beat up his wife â€ “ and to send a clear message to his and her young fans , male and female , that domestic violence is completely unacceptable .
This week I heard a representative of the boxing industry being asked what would happen if , after the press conference brawl between David Haye and Dereck Chisora , they put on a fight between the two .
He said he was sure it would be a sell - out , and they 'd make loads of money , but that people who 'd buy tickets for such an event should question their own morals .
Sometimes the line between accepting and condoning is paper - thin .
Maybe those backing Brown should ask themselves how they 'd react if Rihanna was their daughter or sister ."
"Chris Brown risks spending time in prison after being accused of stealing a woman 's mobile .
Miami prosecutors are speaking to witnesses following an incident on Sunday morning , when the singer â€ “ who is currently on probation â€ “ allegedly took an iPhone from a fan who took his photograph .
Christal Spann has taken the matter to Miami Beach police , complaining of an altercation with Brown outside the Cameo nightclub .
Spann claims she snapped a photo of Brown as he came out of the club and climbed into a black Bentley .
The R&amp;B star then "" reached though his car window and snatched her phone from her hands , "" according to a police report .
As the car pulled away , Brown allegedly sneered , "" Bitch , you ai n't going to put that [ photo ] on no website . ""
"" My prosecutors are currently speaking with witnesses and reviewing all of the materials supplied by Miami Beach police , "" state attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle told NBC Miami on Thursday afternoon .
"" Only after these reviews have been completed would any type of action be considered or taken . ""
Access Hollywood reported that prosecutors are "" preparing an arrest warrant "" .
Although there is nothing particularly serious about a dispute with an amateur paparazzo , Brown has more at stake than a fine or some community service .
He did not serve time for the violent assault of his former girlfriend Rihanna in 2009 : after pleading guilty , the singer was sentenced to five years ' probation .
Probation officers in California are paying close attention to these events in Florida , TMZ reports .
If Brown is found to have stolen Spann 's phone , in violation of his probation , he could be sentenced to as much as four years in jail .
Brown has had a bumpy two weeks following his "" second chance "" comeback at 12 February 's Grammy awards .
Fans , journalists , musicians and wrestlers have spoken out against the rehabilitation of Brown 's public image , particularly given the singer 's apparent lack of remorse .
Brown 's response to certain recent criticism was to tweet , "" HATE
ALL YOU WANT BECUZ
I GOT A GRAMMY
Now !
That 's the ultimate FUCK OFF ! ""
And yet despite this public indignation , the actual victim of Brown 's violence appears to have forgiven him .
Rihanna recently released a new track featuring Brown , and the star also guests on a remix of Brown 's latest single ."

"The emails between Bashar al - Assad 's account and iTunes give an insight into the Syrian president 's state of mind and reveal a man with wide and sometimes surprising tastes .
Alongside songs from the Lebanese actor and singer Nasri Shamseddine , who remains popular in the Arab world almost 30 years after his death , there is an eclectic mix of artists from the 1990s
British duo Right Said
Fred to the US singer Chris Brown .
The fact that the US last year imposed sanctions against Assad and other Syrian government officials , prohibiting "" US persons "" from engaging in transactions with them , may explain why Assad 's iTunes account is registered to another name and a New York address .
One of the more unusual purchases , made through an American Express account , occurred on 5 February when Assad sent his wife , Asma , an iTunes file of the US country star Blake Shelton singing God
Gave Me You .
There is not a huge country music fanbase in the Middle East and a look at the lyrics reveals a conventional tale of life 's ups and downs in the US .
Assad sent the file a day after the shelling of Homs had begun .
A day later , Syrian forces would fire more than 300 rockets into the city .
All of which â€ “ given that he specifically picked out this song for his wife â€ “ seems to have provoked Assad to reflect on his life in these lyrics : "" I 've been a walking heartache /
I 've made a mess of me /
The person that I 've been lately /
Ai n't who I wanna be /
But you stay here right beside me
/ Watch as the storm goes through .
"" Just before Christmas Assad underlined his leftfield tastes when he ordered Do n't Talk
Just Kiss by Right Said Fred , a band that shot to fame with the hit
I 'm Too Sexy .
Days earlier he highlighted his interest in UK pop music , this time with a slightly more credible choice , purchasing Bizarre Love Triangle by New Order .
In the same month he ordered We Ca n't Go Wrong by The Cover Girls , a New - York - based "" urban girl group "" of the 1980s and early 1990s .
The song includes the line : "" There was a time when things were better than the way they are today .
But we forgot the vows we made and love got lost along the way .
"" As the conflict in Syria intensified Assad continued to add to his eclectic playlist , ordering Hurt by Leona Lewis , Look at Me Now by Chris Brown featuring Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes and â€ “ on New Year 's Eve â€ “
A Tribute to Cliff Richard by 21st Century Christmas .
In January he bought a number of songs by the popular US dance group LMFAO including their hit Sexy and
I Know It .
Assad 's iTunes emails also reveal a limited interest in books , gaming and films .
In November he ordered one of the Harry Potter films , Deathly Hallows Part II , as well as several Harry Potter apps .
The next month the Syrian president ordered Real Racing 2 and the biography of the Apple founder Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson ."
"Rihanna has defended her decision to collaborate with Chris Brown on two new songs , explaining he is simply "" the hottest R&amp;B artist out right now "" .
Almost three years after Brown pleaded guilty to assaulting the singer , Rihanna claims to have put the matter behind her .
"" There should n't be a divide , you know ?
"" she said .
"" It 's music and it 's innocent . ""
Despite this purported innocence , Rihanna and Brown have attracted controversy for their contributions to each other 's songs .
The remixes of Birthday Cake and Turn Up the Music are belligerent , sometimes raunchy affairs , without any hints of humility , forgiveness or regret .
The two acts have been spotted together at social events since Brown 's restraining order expired , and Rihanna says she simply wants to reunite their fans .
"" We did two records , "" she told radio host Ryan Seacrest .
"" One for my fans , one for his fans , and that way our fans can come together â€ ¦
I reached out to him about doing Birthday Cake because that 's the only person that really â€ ¦ it made sense to do the record .
Just as a musician , despite everything else , that was going to be the person .
You know I thought about rappers , and I 've done that so many times , and the hottest R&amp;B artist out right now is Chris Brown .
So I wanted him on the track , and then in turn he was like ' Why do n't you do the remix to my track ? '
and it was a trade - off . ""
In an interview last month , Birthday Cake 's co - producer , The - Dream , said the decision to work with Brown was Rihanna 's to make .
"" The same questions that went through my mind â€ ¦ had to have gone through hers , "" he told MTV .
"" I know she 's not crazy .
So my thought was , ' You 've been thinking about this , you 've already thought it out , so
evidently you know what reaction you gon na get ' . """
"There is something slightly different about the version of Chris Brown 's With You sung by Raef , a new signing to Awakening Records .
In his rendition , Raef replaces Brown 's lyrics expressing love for a woman with his love for the Lord .
"" My Lord , no one else will do/
With every test you put me through , miracles you help me
do/
If I have you , I do n't need money , I do n't need cars , Lord you 're my all . ""
"" There is a huge thirst from people who want to listen to music which is not of a detriment to their heart , soul or relationship with their Lord , "" says Raef , of the music he and his fellow artists are producing at Awakening .
"" People have been waiting and yearning for it . ""
Raef will be one of the artists performing at the Hammersmith Apollo on Saturday night at an event called Send a Little Hope , for the charity Save an Orphan .
Awakening 's artists will be collaborating for the first time , and will feature Maher Zain , 31 , a Swede of Lebanese heritage , possibly the biggest name in the Islamic music industry ; Hamza Namira , 31 , an Egyptian musician who shot to prominence with his song El - Midan ( The Square ) , a song in solidarity with the Egyptian revolution ; Mesut Kurtis , a renowned Macedonian Islamic singer of Turkish origin , and others .
As well as the Brown cover , Raef , 29 , has produced Islamic versions of Rebecca Black 's Friday , Bob Marley 's Redemption Song and Michael Jackson 's Man in the Mirror â€ “ though the last two have no changes to the lyrics , because they are seen as positive and inspirational .
Awakening , which has its UK head office in Swansea , began by publishing books , but , spotting a void in the music industry , it has n't looked back .
"" Our ideas and music were fresh , our standard was the western standard , "" says Wali - ur Rahman , one of the founders of the company .
"" We wanted to raise the bar and compete with our western contemporaries , as most other nasheeds [ Islamic music ] was cheaply produced . ""
Traditionally , music has been something of a controversial topic in Islamic jurisprudence , with many Muslims believing it to be prohibited .
However , Awakening 's slogan â€ “ "" faith - inspired and value - driven "" â€ “ elucidates its aim : religious music promoting morality .
"" We were the ones who promoted this type of music and we made it more universal , "" Rahman says .
"" The reaction has always been mostly positive but there is always the issue of ' music ' .
It is generally more accepted than when we first started .
Now , we appeal to not just religious Muslims , but secular ones too â€ “ they 're not just listening to it , they 're enjoying it . ""
However , there is an obvious lack of female role models for Muslim girls , and a female addition to the record label would , for many , be a welcome move , despite being another contentious issue in Islamic jurisprudence .
Melissa Melodee , a singer and rapper based in the UK , and a convert to Islam , says she has faced criticism for her music .
"" The music and messages we [ Muslim women and girls ] are sending out are all positive â€ “ we are n't encouraging people to do bad . ""
In 2003 , Awakening signed its first artist , Sami Yusuf , a British Muslim singer of Azerbaijani origin .
Yusuf was described by Time magazine as "" Islam 's biggest rock star "" after the success of his first two albums Al - Mu'allim (
The Teacher , a reference to the prophet Muhammad ) and My Ummah ( My Muslim Community ) .
The albums went on to sell 3 m and 4 m copies respectively and set the bar for the burgeoning Islamic music industry . ""
When Yusuf released his first album , we were n't prepared for it
â€
“
it was instant success .
We used to host our music videos on our website , but it kept crashing because of its popularity , "" Rahman says .
In 2008 , however , Yusuf had a dispute with Awakening over his third album and later joined the British record label ETM International .
As Yusuf left , Awakening signed Zain , who had been on the brink of stardom in the music industry in the US in 2007 , working with RedOne , a producer who has collaborated with Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez .
But he had a change of heart .
Finding the music industry "" empty "" , he began to practise Islam seriously and signed to Awakening .
His first album , Thank You
Allah , catapulted him to celebrity status in the Islamic world , and he has just released his second album , Forgive Me .
Zain 's latest single , Number One for Me , a song dedicated to his mother , received 1 m YouTube views in just over a week .
"" I 've seen that people want to hear good music but with a positive message .
We are trying to provide more of that , "" he says .
Raef , too , is critical of more mainstream music .
"" The main reason I picked up a guitar was out of frustration , because a lot of the music I heard on pop stations was not helpful for spiritual growth , "" he says .
The record label has provided an opportunity to listen to halal , "" clean "" , music for those who require it and , consequently , has had a profound impact on many young Muslims , particularly in the west .
"" They [ Awakening 's artists ] sing of the love they have for God and Prophet Muhammad , peace be upon him ; it 's so spiritual and beautiful , "" says Nuzhat Ahmed , 25 , a student at City University in London .
"" The words have such a deep meaning , sometimes it brings tears to your eyes .
Instead of listening to rap , it 's better to listen to the likes of Sami Yusuf and Maher Zain . ""
The record label plans to extend its audience further .
"" We are hoping to break into India â€ “ there is a huge market there , "" says Rahman .
At present , Awakening has little competition , but he adds : "" We would like to see more Awakenings .
People are trying to compete , which is good : it will only raise the standard even higher . ""
And it is not just Muslims that these artists hope to appeal to .
Zain believes his second album will have a wider audience .
"" I think it can , "" he insists .
"" Certain aspects can reach out to new people . ""
In One Big Family , he sings : "" No matter how far we are/ Even if we do n't know each other/ You and me , me and you , we are one . """
"File this under : what could possibly go wrong ?
Sporadically embattled R&amp;B crooner Chris Brown is selling pit bull puppies online .
For a guy who can sing so well , Breezy has a track record of being notoriously tone deaf .
See , most recently :
his post - Grammy Twitter rant , long since deleted .
Now Brown is selling eight pit bulls for $ 1,000 a pup through a website he set up called CB Breeds .
The four male and four female American pit bull terriers were born at the end of February and come with names including Pretty , Fortune and Music .
Maureen O'Connor , a spokeswoman for Brown , said that the pups were born to dogs he keeps at his family home in Virginia .
She told the Associated Press that he 's simply selling them to make sure they go to good homes .
Indeed , an adorable Brown is pictured canoodling with an even cuter puppy at the top of the site .
But all one has to do to procure a puppy is click the PayPal link .
There does n't appear to be a vetting process â€ “ hardly something someone concerned about the wellbeing of the dogs would do .
O'Connor also said that Brown has no intention of starting a side business .
However , the site claims that Brown 's pups carry a fourth - generation performance pedigree .
How often does something like that happen without at least a little foresight ?"
"Rihanna has defended her decision to collaborate with her ex - boyfriend Chris Brown , who assaulted the singer in 2009 .
The singer courted controversy in February when she teamed up with Brown to record new versions of her track Birthday Cake and his single Turn Up the Music .
The tracks were released simultaneously , leading many to assume the pair had also reconciled romantically .
But in a new interview with Esquire magazine , Rihanna expressed surprised at the negative reaction : "" The whole thing caught me a little off - guard â€ ¦ especially the amount of negative attention .
Because it never occured to me how this was going to be a problem .
It really did n't .
I thought people were gon na be surprised that we finally did a record together , but I did n't see how people could think it was a bad thing .
In my mind , it was just music . ""
Rihanna became angry at the suggestion that she was sending out the "" wrong message "" to younger fans , insisting that tracks were made "" in a completely professional environment [ and ] on a complete professional note .
I mean , if I went back to him , then that 's a whole different discussion . ""
Yet the star did not rule out the possibility of reuniting with Brown romantically .
"" If I ever do , then that 's something that y' all have to talk to me about when â€ “ if â€ “ that ever happens .
Until then , look at it for what it is .
I think a lot of people jumped to an assumption that was incorrect , and they ended up looking stupid .

"Three years ago , one key question swirled around R&amp;B star Chris Brown : could his career survive ?
He had just pleaded guilty to felony assault , and was soon to be sentenced to five years ' probation and six months ' community labour for a brutal attack on his then girlfriend , Rihanna .
The assault occurred the night before the music industry 's biggest event of the year , the Grammys ; it involved one of the world 's biggest stars ; and it had been documented in a police photograph which soon began circulating online .
It was also the subject of a police report , which described in extensive detail how Rihanna 's head had been shoved against a car window , her face and body punched , her left ear and fingers bitten , and pressure applied to her carotid arteries until she began to lose consciousness .
Brown was still a teenager , a clean - cut star who had dueted with an American Idol winner and made a guest appearance on a Disney TV show .
The jury was out on his future .
Three years later the verdict is in .
Brown 's fifth album , Fortune , was released in the UK this week , and despite poor reviews is expected to reach No 1 on Sunday .
The album 's first single , Turn Up the Music , released this year , was his first to reach the top of the UK charts .
And his new single , Do n't Wake Me Up , has a good chance of repeating that success on Sunday .
This caps a period in which the music industry has been championing Brown .
In February , he was at the Grammys for the first time since the assault , performing twice , and receiving the award for best R&amp;B album â€ “ voted for by industry figures .
This was followed by an appearance at the BET awards last Sunday , where he picked up best male R&amp;B artist .
And while some radio stations dropped his songs after the assault , many have now reinstated them .
Radio 1 started playing his records again in 2011 .
Martin Talbot , managing director of the Official Charts Company , says Brown is reaching listeners far beyond his core fanbase , which has always been vocal and committed .
"" The singles market is very competitive at the moment , "" he says .
"" You 've had to sell over 100,000 to get to number one recently , so you have to connect with a large number of people . ""
Brown has sold about 900,000 albums in the UK to date , says Talbot , but this would be his first No 1 album here ,
"" so he 's peaking right now "" .
Kanya King , founder of the Mobo awards , says Brown 's comeback is due to his "" triple threat ability to sing , dance and act "" .
Mr Drew , a DJ and journalist with Echoes magazine , concurs .
With Brown 's last album , FAME , says Drew â€ “ which went to No 1 in the US and No 10 in the UK
â€ “ "" he managed to tap into the R&amp;B market , which he already owned , plus the hip - hop market , and the dance market â€
¦
So , in one album , in a seemingly non - contrived way , he managed to hit all three bases .
Now , I would say , he 's the biggest , most relevant R&amp;B artist around .
"" Brown has been working with some of the biggest stars , songwriters and producers over the past few years
â€ ”
Justin Bieber , Benny Benassi and Polow da Don , among others â€ ” and music critic Priya Elan , says this has been central to his success . ""
He 's worked with these really big producers , who just churn out hits for everyone , and if you listen to one of his albums , with all those electronic party bangers and falsetto ballads , they tick every box of what 's popular in the charts
â€ ¦
That music is about fantasy , about going to a club , having a great time , and it 's really , really removed from who he is as a person . ""
Dodai Stewart , an editor at women 's website Jezebel.com , who has written extensively about Brown , suspects many listeners separate his music from his actions , and enjoy the songs regardless .
Brown 's notoriety may also be key to his comeback .
After his Grammy appearance this year , for instance , many women tweeted messages to the effect that : "" Chris Brown can beat me any time . ""
Drew met Brown at a junket in 2005 , when "" he was a sweet kid , who could dance a bit , and had a nice smile which the ladies love "" .
His music was softer then . ""
But he has basically gone from that , "" says Drew , "" to somebody who revels in his bad boy image .
"" In the long run , this has n't hurt him .
When Brown first pleaded guilty to the assault charge , he was considered the "" devil incarnate "" , says Drew , but in the years since his bad boy image has , ironically , been embraced by the public . ""
The tattoos , the profanities on his album .
People are n't put off by it , because he 's seen as a credible artist . ""
Before the assault , people who were n't R&amp;B fans did n't necessarily know who Brown was , says Drew . ""
But by association with Rihanna , one of the world 's biggest pop stars , that helped him .
I would n't say necessarily that the incident helped him
â€
“
I hope not â€ “ but definitely having some kind of background story helped build up people 's interest .
"" The support of the stars Brown has worked with has also been important .
Most significant was Rihanna 's decision to contribute to the remix of Turn Up the Music this year , and to have Brown feature on the remix of her song Birthday Cake .
Other female stars have lent support too , including Kelly Rowland , and Cheryl Cole , who said in May : , "" It 's time we all moved on .
That guy is talented as hell . ""
Laura Snapes , who has written about Brown for NME , says she finds it depressing "" that all these artists want him for their track .
It really has upped his profile . ""
After the assault , the consensus was that Brown 's comeback depended on a sustained show of contrition .
That has not been the case .
Last year he responded angrily when asked about the attack on breakfast show , Good Morning America .
After his Grammy success this year , he tweeted : "" HATE ALL U WANT BECUZ
I GOT A GRAMMY
Now !
That 's the ultimate FUCK OFF ! ""
And he is currently involved in a public dispute with a Canadian rapper , Drake .
Lisa King , spokeswoman for Refuge , which campaigns against domestic violence , says she 's not surprised by Brown 's comeback . ""
Domestic violence does n't remain in the headlines for long enough , "" she says .
"" It 's considered one minute , forgotten the next , and I think that 's why we still have such a big problem in this country . ""
One in four women will experience domestic violence in their lifetime , two women a week will be killed as a result , and those statistics horrify everyone .
But there 's nothing really done on a significant campaigning level by the government to really drive those messages home within education . ""
This week Refuge launched their own campaign , fronted by the YouTube star and make - up artist Lauren Luke , to try to get the message to young women in particular that help , support and information is available .
King says Brown 's success "" highlights the fact that nobody 's been brave enough to really take a stand and say , ' OK , we 're not going to publish your music , we 're not going to play your song on the radio . '
"" Stewart says we live in a culture that simply does n't "" offer a lot of serious consequences for people who are violent against women "" .
Charlie Sheen , who has a history of domestic abuse , started appearing in a new sitcom , Anger Management , last month , and there are countless other stars who have committed serious offences against women and gone on to be feted .
Sean Connery once infamously told Barbara Walters that , when it came to slapping a woman , "" if you 've tried everything else â€ ¦ then I think it 's absolutely right "" .
Stewart suspects Brown would have to have killed somebody to be denied an invitation to the Grammys .
Then she poses an interesting question about race .
What if "" he 'd beaten , punched and choked Taylor Swift [ who is white ] ?
Instead of community service , he might be in jail right now . """
"Andrew Emery , hip - hop journalist and author Chris Brown is a hard man to like .
Even if you did n't know of his despicable assault on his then - girlfriend Rihanna , his perma - scowl and endless tweets against "" haters "" are hardly endearing .
And there 's little to applaud in the actions of some of his fans â€ “ "" Team Breezy "" â€ “ whose unwavering support for him and attacks on even his mildest critics gloss over some appalling truths .
In expressing my view that it 's time to forgive him and move on , I 'm not just going to go down the old tried - and - tested "" let 's separate the man from the music "" argument .
The continued opprobrium heaped on Brown â€ “ now peaking as he sits at No1 in the charts â€ “ has found a rare dissenting liberal voice in that of Peter Tatchell , who feels we should accept his apology .
He 's correct .
And by doing so , we 're not turning our backs on abused women , or excusing or trivialising domestic violence .
We 're forgiving , not forgetting .
People find that hard because his apology is n't "" sincere "" enough .
Or mealy - mouthed enough .
Or perhaps he 's just not white enough .
There 's a clear pattern of white artists being forgiven their transgressions while young black artists are expected to disappear and not trouble the public again .
Ooh , that Cheryl Cole is a national treasure , is n't she ?
But today 's pop darling was convicted in 2003 of punching a black toilet attendant in a nightclub assault .
Laura Snapes , associate editor at music website Pitchfork Brown calling his fans
Team Breezy is too perfect : his music is disposable , faceless twaddle .
It also underlines his fans ' delusion that Brown deserves impunity in spite of committing a violent crime .
The argument that we should accept his apology is not just incorrect , it 's impertinent .
The party equally deserving of opprobrium here is the media that let him back in .
At the time of Brown 's attack on Rihanna it was easy for Radio 1 to stop playing his songs because he was barely famous here .
It would have been easy for everyone else to leave him behind then too .
There 's nothing special or distinctive about his music .
Cheryl Cole argued for Brown that "" it 's time people moved on "" ( she would ) , and I could n't agree more â€ “ as long as she 's talking about transferring affections to some other dance - pop cipher .
His ubiquity emboldens his defendants .
Though I 've been asking myself whether it 'd be for better or worse to educate his young fans who do n't know what he did as to his violent past .
AE
Whether you care for his style of music should n't cloud the issue of forgiving him his violence against Rihanna .
I 'd be arguing the same case if it was some dreary Mumford who 'd raised his hand against a woman .
And there 's no question of impunity .
The man was arrested , charged and sentenced .
He was punished and has apologised repeatedly .
The media do n't get to decide if he 's allowed any further success : they could all deride him , all snub him â€ “
he 'd still sell records .
There 's legislation against domestic violence , which Brown rightly fell foul of .
It seems some people also want legislation to outlaw music they do n't like from artists they do n't like .
You 're also in danger of tarring all his fans with the same brush .
They 're not some moronic entity turning a blind eye to his character faults .
Yes , some do .
But I know plenty of people who think he 's a complete idiot but can still appreciate his music .
These are serious , adult people who just happen not to recoil as if modern R&amp;B was something to be ashamed of .
It 's not .
LS
Ah , the "" Chris Brown fans are n't thick
â€
“
I have serious adult friends who like him ! ""
argument .
While recent track Bitch I 'm Paid does n't appear on Fortune , I 'd take issue with anyone who enjoys or tolerates its lyrics , or any of his other misogynistic outpourings .
As the deserved success of Frank Ocean 's nuanced Channel Orange shows , modern R&amp;B is often brilliant and smart .
However , there 's no shame in recoiling at the embarrassing media rehabilitation of a talentless woman - beater â€ “ whatever genre or artistic field
he 's in .
In a survey of Boston teens following the assault , 46 % believed Rihanna was responsible for her attack .
If the major radio stations did blacklist Brown , there 's no way Fortune would have got to No 1 in the UK .
He should n't be allowed to forget his crime .
Only the fact that Rihanna has worked with him since muddies the issue of forgiveness .
AE
Again , you 're using the actions of a tiny minority of his fans to berate the rest .
And to cite Frank Ocean in opposition is laughable .
Is this the same Ocean who guested on Tyler the Creator 's She ?
The song about stalking , rape and necrophilia ?
It seems one person 's misogyny is another person 's "" nuanced "" .
"" Talentless "" is a highly subjective and flippant opinion ; more seriously , race is an ever - present subtext in the discussion of Chris Brown .
People are willing to cast aside the domestic abuse carried out by John Lennon ( should the radio stations blacklist the Beatles ? ) , or the foul , misogynistic behaviour of the Hammer of the Gods era rock stars .
Hell , they 'll even give another Mel Gibson movie a go .
But the white press line up to cast brickbats at Chris Brown , a difficult man with a difficult background in the difficult world that many African - Americans inhabit , but one who has said the important word : sorry .
Perhaps some of the black press and websites and some of the R&amp;B community have given him a free pass but many more have engaged with the issue .
All I hear is "" do n't like him so I wo n't forgive him "" .
Hate his music by all means but the desire to continue to punish is deeply illiberal .
LS I do n't believe the persecution of Chris Brown has anything to do with race ( though the question has been asked : would his punishment have been stronger had he attacked a white woman ? )
Brown has fulfilled his legal obligations but he escaped jail because of his fame â€ “ which undoubtedly grew after attacking Rihanna â€ “ so he should take advantage of it to make up for his crime : perhaps by donating money to relevant charities , or maybe just not acting like a total prick if anyone dares ask him about it .
It 's unrealistic to expect Radio 1 to introduce his songs as "" another red - hot hit from noted woman - beater , Chris Brown ! ""
What 's important is making sure that his young fans know that violence against women is never OK .
When researching the issue for a past piece , I asked some British teen magazines for their position on Brown .
Most of them refused to put him in their publications , or certainly never as a pin - up , which was heartening .
There 's no condoning the behaviour of the misogynistic artists you cite .
Those cases belong to a less progressive time ; with Brown , the music industry had the chance to take a firm stand .
It failed tremendously .
It 's desperately sad that this means there will undoubtedly be a "" next time "" , when we can only hope the response is unequivocal ."
"Even by large - living hip - hop standards , a night out at a New York club could prove to be an expensive one for Drake and Chris Brown .
The pair have been hit by a $ 16 m ( Â£10.2 m ) lawsuit after a brawl between the pair and their entourages at the WiP nightclub on 14 June .
The lawsuit has been brought by the owners of WiP and an adjoining venue , the Greenhouse Club , who claim that the fight â€ “ which left seven people injured â€ “ caused Greenhouse to lose a licensing deal worth $ 4 m .
Both venues also temporarily lost their liquor licence in the aftermath of the melee .
Both musicians used to go out with Rihanna .
The fight developed when Chris Brown sent a bottle of champagne over to Drake 's table , which the rapper sent back .
Ice cubes , then glasses were thrown between both men 's entourages before things escalated .
According to the lawsuit : "" Defendants overran the nightclub 's extensive security measures and the brawl overtook the entire space .
Terrorised patrons ran for cover â€ ¦ most were unable to protect themselves . ""
French basketball player Tony Parker , who was hit in the eye with a glass in the commotion , has filed a lawsuit against the club for $ 20 m .
Drake and Chris Brown 's spokesmen have played down the rappers ' involvement in the fight , and no charges have been brought .
In the lawsuit , the owners claim that Brown and Drake "" should have foreseen that their notoriety and celebrity would ensure that their acts had far reaching and devastating effects "" ."
"More than three years after Rihanna was assaulted by Chris Brown , the singer continues to reflect the incident and its aftermath , saying she felt "" protective "" and "" concerned about "" her ex - boyfriend .
"" As angry as I was â€ “ as angry and hurt and betrayed , "" Rihanna told Oprah Winfrey , "" I just felt like he made that mistake because he needed help . ""
In the new interview , due to air in the US on Sunday , Rihanna said she was afraid of what would happen to Brown after the incident became public .
"" It became a circus and I felt protective , "" the singer explained .
"" Who 's gon na help him ?
Nobody 's gon na say he needs help .
Everybody 's gon na say he 's a monster without looking at the source . ""
After initially denying the charges , Brown eventually pleaded guilty to assaulting Rihanna in the early hours of 8 February 2009 .
According to the police report , the couple got into an argument after Rihanna found a text message on Brown 's phone , sent by an ex - girlfriend .
Brown tried to force Rihanna out of his car before punching her repeatedly in the face , causing bleeding .
After throwing her phone out of the window , he continued to punch the pop star 's arms , hands and legs , biting her ear and hands , and twice placing her in a headlock .
Police were called after a witness heard Rihanna 's screams .
"" It was a weird , confusing space to be in , "" Rihanna said this week .
"" I felt like the only person they [ hated was ] him . ""
Brown , who grew up in an abusive household , was sentenced to one year 's probation and domestic violence counselling .
"" It was embarrassing , it was humiliating , "" Rihanna said .
"" I lost my best friend .
Everything I knew switched , switched in a night , and I could n't control that . ""
Though Brown 's career initially suffered , it has since bounced back .
He and Rihanna collaborated on two songs earlier this year , and the 23-year - old won his first Grammy .
On Wednesday Brown was named as co - defendant in a $ 16 m (
Â£10.2 m ) lawsuit , brought by a New York nightclub ;
the owners allege Brown and the rapper Drake caused a massive brawl after arguing about Rihanna .
Seven people , including a professional basketball player , were injured ."
"In 2009 , when I interviewed Rihanna for the Guardian , I asked whether she might use her experiences at the hands of ex - boyfriend , Chris Brown , to help other victims of domestic violence .
Brown had been sentenced some months before , for an attack which , according to police documents , involved him shoving Rihanna 's head against a car window , punching her repeatedly in the face , biting her left ear and fingers , and placing her in a headlock until she began to lose consciousness .
Rihanna was clear .
She would like to help others , she said , but "" I do n't want that stamp going across my head as a victim of domestic violence .
As much as I was , that 's a part of my life that I want to throw away , that I never want to go through again .
"" I thought of that conversation , her wish not to be branded by her experiences , when looking at Chris Brown 's new neck tattoo .
As many have noted , it looks surprisingly like the image of Rihanna that circulated after that attack , a woman with her eyes bruised , lips split , seriously battered .
Sources have told gossip website TMZ that it 's not of Rihanna , but "" a random woman "" .
But is she meant to look beaten ?
Early sketches suggest some sort of decoration on her face , rather than bruising , so it 's possible the finished article is being misconstrued .
In that case , Brown should think twice about revisiting the tattoo artist in question .
Because there 's no doubt the image calls to mind the biggest scandal of his career , looks absolutely like a pummeled woman , and is in those terms completely sickening .
What 's also depressing is that if this is , in fact , the intention , it would actually mark a natural next step in Brown 's career path .
While he might have been expected to be contrite in the wake of the 2009 attack , he has actually built a strong and burgeoning profile by embracing a bad boy image .
He started out as a clean - cut teenager , the kind of singer who made guest appearances on Disney shows , but in the intervening years he has responded angrily to questions about the attack on a breakfast TV show , and after success at the Grammys , tweeted "" HATE ALL U WANT BECUZ
I GOT A GRAMMY
Now !
That 's the ultimate FUCK OFF ! ""
So he is not exactly keeping his head down and making amends .
He has been rewarded with enormous success , soaring adulation .
He 's had both a number one single and album in the UK this year , having never charted anything like so highly before the attack .
And there are now rumours he may get back together with Rihanna .
At the MTV video music awards last week , the two were seen to embrace , and she spoke warmly about him in a recent interview with Oprah Winfrey , describing him as "" the love of my life "" .
If there 's one thing more sickening than Brown 's new tattoo , it 's those who have criticised Rihanna for her renewed relationship with him , suggesting she wo n't deserve sympathy if she 's hurt again .
Every time people do this â€ “ and many even blamed her for the attack itself â€
“
I am reminded of another conversation we had in that 2009 interview , in which we spoke about her relationship with her father , Ronald , a former drug addict who had physically abused her mother .
His behaviour had made her hate him , she told me : "" Then , one of my school friends , who I was very close to , she knew , and she always used to say , ' You ca n't hate your father , ' that you have to love him , at the end of the day , because he 's your father .
So I listened , as much as it took out of me . ""
Rihanna has experience of forgiving men who act brutally , but that forgiveness does n't carry any responsibility for being hurt .
When someone is beaten , the only person with responsibility is the one with the balled - up fist .
If Chris Brown 's body art reminds us of anything , it should be that ."
"Chris Brown has denied suggestions that his new tattoo portrays the bruised face of his ex - girlfriend , Rihanna .
The inked sketch "" is art "" , he said , intended to represent a Mexican sugar skull .
"" I 'm an artist and this is art , "" Brown tweeted .
His publicist also released a statement , dismissing the suggestion that Brown 's tattoo is a reference to Rihanna , whom Brown attacked in 2009 .
"" His tattoo is a sugar skull ( associated with the Mexican celebration of the Day of the Dead ) and a MAC cosmetics design he saw , "" they said .
"" It is not Rihanna or an abused woman as erroneously reported . ""
Brown 's tattoo was first spotted on 1 September , a week before he and Rihanna were seen kissing at the MTV VMAs .
It clearly shows a woman 's face , distorted with curlicues and crosshatching : although she happens to resemble Rihanna , it does also recall the traditional makeup for the Day of the Dead .
In February 2009 , Brown assaulted Rihanna in his car , punching and biting her in the face and limbs .
The singer required stitches .
Brown later pleaded guilty to the assault and was sentenced to one year 's probation .
"" I just felt like he made that mistake because he needed help , "" Rihanna said in August , during an interview with Oprah Winfrey . ""
He was my first love .
Now we 're very close friends .
And that 's not anything we 're going to try to change . """
"This week , someone noticed singer Chris Brown 's new neck tattoo and all hell broke loose .
Though there are few clear photos available of the new marking , it appears to be a line drawing of a woman 's face , half etched with a peculiar mix of floral and faux tribal symbols and shading .
The image could be a female version of the ghouls that flanked Brown during his recent performance at MTV 's Video Music Awards .
Brown has now claimed that the artwork represents a Mexican sugar skull .
But most who have followed the singer 's antics over the past few years seem to roundly agree that the tattoo resembles most strongly a battered woman : in 2009 , Brown pled guilty to battering his then girlfriend , pop star Rihanna .
A frothing public poured its outrage across the internet ( as you do ) .
But frankly , the indignation rings hollow .
Brown 's smirking arrogance and defiance when faced with the consequences of his violence make him easy to cast as the perfect devil .
He shows no signs of committing to changed behavior , long - term education or counseling .
He has offered the barest lip service to contrition and backed his unconvincing penitence with nothing material save what was court - ordered .
And he has , from the moment the attack on Rihanna came to light , seemed eager to brush it off as a youthful indiscretion and move on with the business of cribbing Michael Jackson 's moves and being famous .
That â€ “ like tiger blood enthusiast Charlie Sheen before him
â€ “ he retains the love of the entertainment industry and a legion of fans only makes matters worse .
It 's hard to argue that enmity directed at a man who demonstrates his personal growth through further reported violence and homophobic ranting is n't righteous .
But the public anger at Brown simply does n't square with the way mistreatment of women is ignored and justified when it is n't committed by a celebrity who is easy to hate and its victim is not a pretty , young star .
For example , would that the routine misogyny of the internet , where , over the last 24 hours , anti - Brown screeds have multiplied , also provoked outrage .
Some of the same corners of the web expressing vein - bulging anger at "" Breezy 's "" latest also regularly abet woman - hatred .
The commentariat at Gawker property , Gizmodo , went in on Brown in response to a post by writer Emma Carmichael .
But less than a month before , writer Molly Oswaks had to defend herself , and her fellow female writers at the site , against the relentless sexism of that same community .
This is not to compare internet trolling to physical battery , but to say that no cookies need be given for recognizing and objecting to Brown 's violence and gross antics .
Disgust for an unrepentant abuser is the least we can ask for from right - thinking human beings , yes ?
But properly invested condemnation of the mistreatment of women should extend beyond high - profile celebrity cases to the other nooks and crannies where sexism lurks and potential violence festers more or less unchecked .
More telling is the "" concern "" shown for Brown 's victim .
It is bad enough that , in the days following the attack , some people searched for reasons to justify Brown 's violence .
But Rihanna has come under increased scrutiny in the years following the incident , for her dress , her partying , her sexuality and for not being as incensed at Chris Brown as we are .
In 2011 , the pair recorded a song together â€ “ the explicit "" Birthday Cake "" .
And in a recent interview with Oprah Winfrey , the tearful singer expressed love for Brown and seemed to minimize his abuse .
Rihanna 's message is not one we want young girls , or boys , to hear .
A shocking number of teens have reacted to this public case of abuse by blaming the victim .
But abuse is devastating to the body and mind .
Survivors of domestic violence often find it difficult to disconnect from their abusers .
Rather than allowing Rihanna her healing , and understanding the psychological toll of abuse , the public demands that she be strong and make decisions that please them .
If we 're going to support a victim of domestic violence , she had best be a "" perfect "" one .
Rage against a pompous , violent fool is easy ; compassion for imperfect victims is much harder .
Recognizing and addressing the roots of misogyny seemingly harder still .
Unless the public can move past the first of these to the logical but more difficult next steps , then the breast - beating over the ongoing tragedy that is Chris Brown and Rihanna 's relationship is just so much impotent sound and fury ."

"Chris Brown 's foray into repulsively self - referential body art was the tipping point for some .
His latest album Fortune has been covered with bespoke warning stickers in London branches of HMV .
"" Warning , "" they say .
"" Do not buy this album !
This man beats women . ""
Similar guerilla art tactics were used in 2006 when Banksy re - tooled Paris Hilton 's debut album , Paris :
she was topless on the cover , her head was replaced with a dog 's on the inlay photos and the listed song titles were changed to philosophical chin - strokers such as Why Am I Famous ? ,
What Have I Done ?
and What Am I
For ?
Sabotaging record sleeves is a decades - old pastime for many ( who has n't drawn a pirate goatee over a popstar 's face in Biro ? ) and a random assortment has been collected together on the Defaced Value Tumblr site .
The best ones have an obvious subtext , such as the topless girl on the cover of Blind Faith 's album with a bra hastily scribbled on , Bowie 's Heroes with him clutching the Velvet Underground 's banana like a baby , and Bruce Springsteen getting kicked in the derriere on Born in the USA .
So , how long before we see Emeli SandÃ © 's album with "" Available for Rio 2016 opening ceremony â€ “ will bring own microphone ! ""

"If anyone 's a winner from the Chris Brown controversy it 's Mick Hucknall , for the first time since 1986 no longer the most unlikable man in music .
His bad rap was n't just down to his smarmy playboy image , flashing his leonine locks on the arm of strings of models like a Cabbage Patch Bryan Ferry and bedding , by his own account , three women a day in his late-80s heyday .
It was because he had become the cod - funk Casanova by selling 50 million albums of insipid plastic pop and cafe soul covers with Simply Red .
Hucknall was the guy who had half - inched the high - life .
He 's not giving up his title easily , though .
Like many ageing stars with their creative peak far behind them , Hucknall has dedicated his solo career ( amazingly , Simply Red only split in 2009 ) to staking claims on the music of others , replacing Rod Stewart in the re - formed Faces and recording cover albums .
Tribute to Bobby , in 2008 , was an homage to blues legend Bobby "" Blue "" Bland , and October brings a collection of American soul standards .
His set list on this covers - only tour displays a connoisseur 's appreciation of classic soul and blues â€ “ Arthur Alexander 's The Girl
That Radiates That Charm , Ray Charles 's Lonely Avenue â€ “ but his delivery , Ã la X Factor or Stewart , smacks of an attempt to take credit for classics .
He plays the first hour like a two - verses - only game of Name
That Tune , inviting us to "" see if you know this one "" , hunting out applause of recognition and failing to build any sort of climax .
His shrill , chart - varnished voice sucks much of the passion out of the tunes , managing only an airy sweetness on I
Only Have Eyes for You and flunking its biggest test on
Do n't Let Me Be Misunderstood , failing to rival the desperate punch of Elvis Costello or Eric Burdon , let alone Nina Simone 's original .
It does n't help that Hucknall encourages a cruise ship supper - club mood by letting his Haight - Ashbury - esque band noodle through a 12-bar blues before he even takes the stage , name - dropping David Bowie and Princess Di , and repeatedly mentioning his charity work .
You almost expect to step out of the Albert Hall to find it 's now moored in CancÃºn .
After crowd - pleaser
If You Do n't Know Me
By
Now proves the dictionary definition of "" soporific "" , things pick up when Hucknall loses the velvet jacket , unbuttons the paisley shirt and gets his ( limited ) groove on .
A 52-year - old prone to "" sexy "" grinding like Tim Minchin 's smug soul uncle should never be allowed near sleazy funk such as When Girls Do It , but he finds some heart , soul and lung power for an encore of Money 's Too Tight ( to Mention ) and a bellow through Etta James 's
I 'd Rather Go Blind that almost convinces you he has known heartbreak , presumably thanks to a black book scheduling mix - up at Fashion Week 1987 .
But even here he 's the sound of Alabama Shakes belching in their sleep .
More likable ?
A touch .
But still far from lovable .

"Irish rap trio Original Rudeboys have turned down an offer to perform with Chris Brown , citing the singer 's 2009 attack on his then - girlfriend , Rihanna .
Appearing with Brown would "" go against everything we are about "" , they explained .
According to the group 's interview with RTE , reps for Chris Brown approached the Original Rudeboys to open his 3 December concert at Dublin 's O2 Arena .
"" Even though it 's a huge opportunity to play in the O2 with a major hip - hop star , and a substantial fee was offered , "" Sean Walsh said , "" we are completely against Chris Brown 's assault on Rihanna . ""
The incident also has a bearing on the Original Rudeboys ' new single , Blue Eyes , which is "" about domestic violence "" .
"" You tell your mates he 's great/ but read the clues , "" the song 's lyrics advise .
"" It makes sense to break up and escape/ the way he leaves you in a state/ broken and bruised . ""
Domestic violence "" goes against everything we are about as a band , "" Walsh said , "" and supporting Chris Brown would send out the wrong message to our fans . ""
The Original Rudeboys ' debut album was released in Ireland this March , reaching No 3 in the charts .
The acoustic hip - hop group has gone on to open for Cheryl Cole and the Script .
Their next gig is at the Academy in Dublin on 22 December ."
"It takes half a verse before Rihanna spits out her first "" fuck "" and less time to realise that this Barbadian means business .
Her seventh album in seven years is all filthy lyrics and crashing dubstep drops : R&amp;B - pop turned up to 11 .
Pour It
Up 's strip - club mise - en - scene and Jump 's invitations to ride Rihanna 's "" pony "" see sex wriggling everywhere , while her provocative duet with ex - boyfriend Chris Brown , who assaulted her in 2009 , is a difficult listen ( "" every touch is infectious "" indeed ) .
Better are the weaving , moody strings of Get It
Over With , and Numb 's Missy Elliott - style bhangra riff and synths .
Everything 's been whacked into the mix â€
“
here 's where it works ."
"Ah , Twitter .
Turn your back on it for a moment and something major happens .
Take last night , for example , when comic writer Jenny Johnson bravely risked the ire of millions of tweenage hip hop fans and goaded Chris Brown into deleting his account , hopefully forever , in what was presumably either a toddler tantrum of apoplectic proportions or his PR "" people "" putting him on lockdown .
Unfortunately for us , there is no similarly convenient way to delete his music , but nevertheless there is cause for celebration here .
For those of you who do n't inhabit the strange internet universe of Twitter and TMZ , I 'll provide some background .
Chris Brown is the abusive ex(?)-boyfriend of international megastar Rihanna .
In 2009 , Brown strangled , bit and punched Rihanna during an argument , the awful effects of which were available for all to see in the widely published police photographs of his girlfriend 's bruised and beaten face .
Some of Brown 's fans , who are known collectively and pathetically as "" Team Breezy "" , could n't see what all the fuss was about , and took to Twitter to profess their love for their idol in the form of messages whose general gist was "" he can beat me all night if he wants "" .
Since then , Brown has pleaded guilty to assault and is apparently undergoing violence counselling , as well as claiming to have changed despite showing absolutely no remorse for his crimes whatsoever ( when confronted , his standard response seems to be along the lines of "" suck my dick "" , as happened yesterday ) .
Meanwhile , he and Rihanna have recorded a couple of duets together , the most recent of which is called Nobody 's Business .
You do n't have to be a genius to work out that the lyrics pertain to the continued speculation surrounding their relationship , a media flame that is kept constantly stoked and burning bright , often by the stars themselves .
Rihanna , whose desire to associate with Brown is met with a predictable mixture of dismay and victim blaming , went on Oprah to say that she still loved him , and last night tweeted a picture of him passed out in her hotel room .
Those more intent on condemning Brown have called for fans to boycott his "" clusterfuck of an album "" , with little impact .
Up until last night , many of Brown 's legions of Twitter followers were still eagerly defending him .
It is a blessing that he 's gone .
But boy did Brown go out with a misogynist bang .
After the aforementioned comedian Jones educated him on the correct spelling of "" ho "" ( "" it 's ' ho ' not ' hoe ' you dumb fuck "" ) , Brown clearly completely lost it and responded with the hilariously impolite "" I should fart while ur giving me top "" , before adding that his mum wanted him to defecate in her eye .
It 's all fairly puerile stuff , obviously , but does go some way to revealing the inner workings of the singer 's fame - addled mind , which seem to consist mainly of the notion that anyone who disagrees with him should immediately get down on their knees and administer oral .
Because that 's what you do when you find someone utterly repulsive .
It 's obvious that Brown is in possession of what the feminist society at my university once described as a "" predatory sense of entitlement "" ( not to mention some fairly shocking manners ) .
This does not particularly differentiate him from many other men , but it does imply that his attitude towards women is somewhat lacking .
Despite this , those intent on blaming Rihanna and her failure to stand up to Brown continue to do so , despite the fact that the difficulties victims of domestic violence face in leaving their abusers are well known .
Granted , their continued relationship does n't send the most positive message to young girls , but the neither does the fact that the coalition government are withdrawing funding from charities such as Refuge .
Helping battered and broken women and children and holding their abusers to account has never really been all that high on society 's to do list , to be honest .
In holding Brown to account on Twitter , Johnson did what everyone should have been doing for months .
Writing opinion pieces hysterically headlined "" WHY RIHANNA , WHY ? "" , calling her a poor role model , and documenting every last detail of her relationship is not going to help her .
Perhaps telling Brown he 's a "" useless piece of shit "" wo n't either , but at least it communicates a no - tolerance approach to violence .
The fact that more people have n't done this may indicate that they 're aware of their complicity .
After all , they buy the magazines and maybe even the singles , they click the Mail Online links , and they write the column inches that judge this woman for her inaction .
I wo n't go as far as to call the relationship between Brown and Rihanna a publicity stunt , but it certainly keeps them trending .
To many of us , it is entertainment , it is soap opera , it is tacit acceptance .
This latest development merely provides us with another instalment of the Chris and Rihanna show .
If we 're not going to bother to stand up to this vile man , then perhaps it 's time we all stopped watching ."
"Age : 33 .
Appearance : Blond hair , looking sideways , mildly amused , surrounded by pictures of some dog .
How unusual .
Tell me , what are these pictures attached with ?
Tape ?
Paperclips ?
Ah .
No .
I 'm talking about her Twitter page , where the dog appears .
I see .
Next question : why are you talking about her Twitter page where the dog appears ?
Because she used it to make Chris Brown angry .
The noted musician and girlfriend - beater ?
That 's him .
Is n't he always angry ?
Not quite this angry .
It began when he tweeted : "" I look as old as fuck !
I 'm only 23 â€ ¦ "" Fishing for compliments .
Textbook insecurity .
Yes , but it kind of backfired , because Johnson replied : "" I know !
Being a worthless piece of shit can really age a person . ""
Goodness .
Do people on Twitter always swear this much ?
Some do , I 'm afraid , and worse .
Next , Brown invited Johnson to have a kind of sex with him , calling her a "" hoe "" .
That 's no insult !
It 's an essential part of any gardener 's toolkit .
Yes , but I think he meant "" ho "" , the abusive term for a woman .
Johnson pointed this out .
That must have made him furious .
I hate it when someone corrects my spelling .
Indeed .
He was n't happy .
First , he suggested they have various other kinds of sex , then he left Twitter completely , deleting his account .
Strange man .
Does he plan to give up music and hitting people too ?
I 've got nothing on that , as yet .
Although many of his fans retaliated by sending Johnson rude remarks and death threats of various kinds .
The mature response to any setback .
And who exactly is this Johnson character ?
She 's someone who makes jokes on Twitter .
That 's a job now , is it ?
I think so .
She lives in Texas .
She used to be a television news producer .
Now she mostly spends her time making dirty jokes and being rude to Kim Kardashian and Chris Brown .
It 's entrepreneurs like that who will revive the world economy .
If you say so .
Do say : "" Thanksgiving is the only time of year when Amish people 's clothes seem fun and festive . ""
Do n't say : "" This is a victory for trolls everywhere . """
"Step aside , Cheryl Cole and Cher Lloyd .
Out of the way , Lily Allen and Courtney Love .
Move along , Chris Brown and the entire world .
When it comes to ridiculous celebrity Twitter spats , there 's a new daddy in town .
In the red corner , representing New York , the silliest faction of American Republicans and haircuts that look like monkey bottoms : Donald Trump .
In the blue corner , representing corrugated iron industrial parks , pronouncing the word "" bloody "" as if it has the letter A in it and a million Amstrad Em@iler jokes : Lord Alan Sugar .
The pair seem to have been circling each other for months now , both in terms of letting the world know they do n't watch the other 's version of The Apprentice and starting witless online squabbles with anyone they can think of , but yesterday Trump and Sugar finally charged at each other headfirst , and it was spectacular to witness .
First , Trump used Twitter to criticise the UK government 's fondness for wind turbines â€ “ possibly because they might spoil the views from his country - crushing megacorp of a golf course â€ “ to which Sugar replied "" The Scottish do n't want you ! ""
Sadly for posterity , Sugar has since deleted his contributions to the row from his Twitter feed .
It escalated from there .
Trump shot back with : "" If you think ugly windmills are good for Scotland you are an even worse businessman than I thought and , in my opinion , should not be doing The Apprentice . ""
Never a man to take the directionless frothing of an egotist lying down , Sugar quickly hammered out an oblivious missive of his own : "" well you have NO SAY in that .
The British like me not you .
the ugly windmills will bring more revenue and green power to Scotland than your golf project .
"" On and on it went .
Trump : "" Sugar â€ “ unlike you , I own The Apprentice .
You were never successful enough to do The Apprentice
but I approved you anyway .
Without my show you 'd be nothing ! ""
Sugar : ""
You approved me !
What a load of rubbish dream on You do n't own apprentice Mark Burnett does .
Shut up and argue with Obama . ""
Trump : "" Keep working hard so I make plenty of $ with your show .
You have little persona , but The Apprentice concept is great and lucky for you ! ""
Sugar : "" You have had a charisma bypass . ""
Trump replied : "" Drop to your knees , Sugar , and say thank you , Mr. Trump . ""
At this point , bang on cue , Piers Morgan â€ “ a man who has flown planes with Alan Sugar , won Trump 's Celebrity Apprentice and will never knowingly let anything high - profile pass without wedging his gelatinous face right in the middle of it â€ “ barged in to suggest that Trump should fire Sugar .
And this is where Alan Sugar lost it , ranting : "" You are full of sh ..
Trump you have no power over the UK Apprentice , just like the Scottish people .
"" Whether he meant that a ) Donald Trump has no power over Scottish people , b ) Donald Trump has no power over the UK Apprentice or c ) that Scottish people have no power over the UK Apprentice , will for ever be lost to the ages .
Who knew that there was so much inter - Apprentice contention ?
In retrospect , it 's just a shame that other global Apprentice hosts did n't join in with the mudslinging .
What a joy it would have been to see Vladimir Potanin from the Russian show leap into the middle and throw down ?
Or Tokyo Sexwale , South Africa 's minister of human settlements and boss of South Africa 's The Apprentice ?
Or Inger Ellen Nicolaisen , the hairdressing magnate formerly in charge of the Norwegian version ?
That said , she 's a hairdressing magnate .
She could n't have possibly sided with Trump .
It would go against everything she 's ever stood for .
Luckily , for all of us , the spat has cooled in the past few hours .
All that 's left are the memories , and a fascinating glimpse into the management styles of the two men .
Trump , it seems , rules with a mixture of grandiose claims and a kind of General Zod - style imperiousness .
Meanwhile , Sugar attacks life with a reckless disregard for grammar and basic punctuation .
Both , however , are united in their love of epic , all - powerful , world - ignoring delusion .
It 's just a shame they ca n't put their differences aside and learn to love each other .
If they could , they 'd make a wonderful pair of children 's entertainers ."
"Last November , 265 journalists and fans boarded Rihanna 's jet for her week - long 777 jaunt , a hubristic and shambolic PR stunt to promote a mediocre record which used this once - interesting star 's reunion with former assailant Chris Brown as a tacky selling point .
Rolling Stone 's reporter described passengers as "" ignored , bored , hungry and annoyed "" and concluded : "" Never do something like this again . ""
If Buddy Holly 's fatal plane journey on 2 February 1959 was , according to Don McLean , the day the music died , then 777 was the week the music took a long hard look at itself .
The 777 tour felt symbolic of the current sickly condition of chart pop .
The industry 's falling revenues have induced suffocating caution and cynicism as more and more eggs are stuffed into a few threadbare baskets .
Most of the chart 's regular visitors are the same as they were two years ago .
Producers such as David Guetta , Calvin Harris and will.i.am have presided over a ubiquitous lowest - common - denominator mulch of pop , hip - hop and dance music whose lyrical vision rarely extends below the club VIP room .
The output of tireless Miami rapper Pitbull is so increasingly cretinous that each release makes its predecessor sound like River Deep Mountain High , and the Olympics closing ceremony suggested that if the answer is always Jessie J then you 're asking the wrong question .
Like the benighted passengers on 777 , chart pop sounds exhausted and nauseous .
Even the usually upbeat Popjustice website recently decided : "" Pop needs a kick up the arse .
"" There are three ways of assessing such a slump .
One is the kneejerk anti - pop argument that the top 40 has always been terrible and always will be .
Another is the declinist view that there was a halcyon era ( which invariably coincides with the listener 's own youth ) and we are doomed to live in its shadow .
The third approach is that it is a point on a cycle : another fall before another rise before another fall , and so on .
Despite the depressing prevailing winds , change is definitely afoot .
The largest bastions of tabloid values and tin - eared conservatism are vulnerable .
The last two seasons of X Factor have haemorrhaged viewers and Chris Moyles has ceded the Radio 1 breakfast show to the younger , sharper Nick Grimshaw , a DJ whose favourite sound is not his own voice .
Meanwhile , some of the year 's biggest hits have been refreshing anomalies .
A couple of years ago , nobody was banking on global success for a thirtysomething South Korean ( PSY ) , a Belgian - Australian drummer called Wally ( Gotye ) , and a drowsy starlet whose music resembles a high - school musical based on the movies of David Lynch ( Lana Del Rey ) .
People who disdain chart pop tend to assume that the average listener is a tasteless mug who will stomach any formulaic tat because they do n't know any better .
The likes of Simon Cowell and Pitbull operate on that principle .
But even the least discerning listeners get restless and hungry for something new .
Give them a Somebody That I Used to Know or Video Games , a record that does n't follow the script , and they will often embrace it .
Underestimate them and you might get away with it in the short - term , but eventually they 'll turn around and say : "" Enough ! ""
George Ergatoudis , head of music at Radio 1 and 1Xtra , recently said : "" Guitar music is definitely on the way back . ""
But the answer to pop 's malaise is n't white boys with guitars .
For one thing , there 's little sign that it is on the way back .
For another , it 's foolish to assume that a rock revival is a silver bullet that will change everything .
There is already so much great pop on the verge of mainstream success .
Hip - hop and R&amp;B hip - hop and R&amp;B have been creatively reinvigorated by adventurous new releases from Frank Ocean , Miguel , Angel Haze and Kendrick Lamar .
Jessie Ware demonstrates the neglected virtues of subtlety and restraint while Katy B 's recent Danger EP is an exciting taster for her forthcoming second album of club - savvy pop .
There is exciting traffic between genres as left - of - centre UK producers such as Jamie xx and Hudson Mohawke seize the chance to reinvigorate US stars .
And new artists such as London duo AlunaGeorge , Glasgow 's CHVRCHES and LA trio
Haim are writing fantastic , inventive songs with commercial appeal .
Some of these acts feature on the current Radio 1 playlist , which is taking far more chances than it was this time a year ago .
It could go further .
At its very best the top 40 resembles a massive house party with nobody guarding the door .
The extroverts are on the dancefloor , the oddballs are in the kitchen and all manner of surprising couplings are taking place in the room where the coats are stored .
The mingling of people who would otherwise never meet is what makes it interesting and relevant .
Of late , the party has taken on a desperate 5 am feel .
Pitbull is spraying himself with champagne , Calvin Harris hogs the stereo , Britney wanders around looking sad and lost , Jessie J is everywhere , and all the oddballs have gone home because nobody was talking to them .
But there are some intriguing new arrivals at the door and this year should see at least some of them walk right in ."
"Chris Brown and Frank Ocean ended up coming to blows on Sunday night over a car parking space , according to reports .
Police were called to the incident at Westlake Recording studio in LA , which allegedly left Ocean nursing an injured hand . ""
Got jumped by Chris and a couple of guys .
lol , "" Ocean tweeted , adding : "" Cut my hand now I ca n't play with two hands at the grammys . ""
However , insiders close to Brown insist that it was Ocean who started the brawl after the Channel Orange star blocked him in the car park .
According to TMZ sources , Ocean said : "" This is my studio , this is my parking spot .
"" It is alleged that "" one of Frank 's people "" then attacked Brown when he went to shake hands with Ocean .
This is not the first time the two singers have fallen out .
Earlier this year Brown was accused of aiming a homophobic slur towards Ocean , who came out last year .
Brown denied this , posting on Twitter : "" My Opinion on the whole Frank Ocean subject is .........
Love who u wanna love .
It 's ur decision .
People stop searching for BS . """
"Chris Brown is under investigation for an alleged assault in a West Hollywood parking lot , the Los Angeles County sheriff 's department said early Monday .
Deputies responding to a report of six men fighting Sunday night found the scene clear , but were told by witnesses there had been a brief fight over a parking space . ""
The altercation allegedly led to Chris Brown punching the victim , "" the department said in a statement released early Monday morning .
The "" victim "" was n't identified , but the celebrity website TMZ , which first reported the fight outside the Westlake Recording Studio , said it also involved Frank Ocean , one of the top nominees at the Grammys next month .
In a Twitter posting later , Ocean said he "" got jumped by ( Brown ) and a couple guys "" and suffered a finger cut .
It was n't Brown 's first problem in the run - up to the Grammys .
His attack on singer Rihanna on the eve of the 2009 awards overshadowed that evening 's show .
Last June , he was injured in a brawl with members of Drake 's entourage at a New York nightclub .
No arrests were made .
Brown was gone by the time deputies arrived but the department said the investigation is ongoing and Brown would be contacted later .
Email messages to Ocean 's publicist and Brown 's lawyer and representative were not immediately returned .
A man answering the phone at the recording studio declined to comment .
Brown , 23 , remains on probation for the attack on Rihanna and is due back in court on February 6 to update a judge on his progress .
Prosecutors have raised concerns about records showing that Brown has completed his community labor obligations ."
"It 's actually exhausting trying to remain surprised about each new episode in Chris Brown 's life .
Yet today 's developments have reached a new level of ludicrous for R&amp;B 's public enemy number one , with his extraordinary reaction to his spat with Frank Ocean .
It already takes a special kind of self - involvement to pick a fight with the most revered man in music .
And now , Brown has taken to Instagram to post a painting of himself as Jesus on the cross with the charming caption , "" Painting the way I feel today .
Focus on what matters !
"" It 's an astonishing move on all kinds of levels .
But of course , the Pop Star God Complex has a long and illustrious history .
Although first coined by psychoanalyst Ernest Jones ( in his 1923 collection Essays in Applied Psycho - Analysis ) simply as ' a belief that one is God ' , a God Complex is not a diagnosable condition .
So it might be just as useful to look to UrbanDictionary.com 's present - day definition as "" a psychosis based in uncontrolled narcissism , inflated arrogance and a perceived need to subjugate and/or ridicule other individuals deemed to be inferior or unworthy "" .
In that light , it sounds a lot more like the everyday kind of narcissism we often admire and even expect in our pop stars .
Different beasts from the mere "" musician "" or "" celebrity "" , they exist like indulged superheroes .
Yet there are still gradients of this behaviour , which their adoring public are prepared to put up with .
When John Lennon declared in 1966 that the Beatles were "" bigger than Jesus "" there was uproar and radio boycotts followed , but in hindsight it was the kind of socially - minded Scouse sarcasm we 've come to adore him for ( though Lennon has also been accused of having some very unsavoury qualities ) .
The ruck over Michael Jackson 's rendering of himself as a Christlike figure in his Brits performance of Earth Song spoke more of the perceived worries about his mental state .
People were appalled , but also concerned , since the memories of an innocent and childlike Jackson just did not square with what was unfolding .
But when Madonna performed onstage , chained to a metal cross and wearing a crown of thorns , it did n't have anything like the impact .
She 'd already made a career out of subverting religious imagery and , besides , that near - heroic self - regard is what much of her persona has been built on .
Perhaps the most startling example of all , however , comes from 1960s British rock'n'roller Vince Taylor , David Bowie 's muse and originator of Brand New Cadillac .
Taylor 's already erratic tendencies were exacerbated by an athletic consumption of booze and drugs , which led him to be convinced he had astral connections with alien incursions and Christ .
At one career - crucial show in London , he took to the stage in white robes and declared he was the apostle Matthew .
Taylor 's substance abuse did much for his career ( although , he ended his life in 1991 , as an aircraft mechanic in Switzerland ) .
But just as Christ was supposed to have died so we might live , Taylor lived the dream so you did n't have to , and was rewarded by history by becoming a key ingredient for Ziggy Stardust , with Bowie declaring "" if Vince Taylor did n't exist , you 'd have to invent him "" .
Which to an atheist , is the exact reason why a humanity uncertain of itself felt the need to create the idea of an interventionist God in the first place .
Me , I prefer to worship pop stars in general .
While remembering that one should probably draw the line at Chris Brown ."
"Frank Ocean may press charges following last weekend 's brawl with fellow singer Chris Brown , while police and prosecutors are investigating a possible misdemeanor claim against whoever caused the brawl outside a Los Angeles recording studio .
"" Chris Brown is a named suspect in a battery report , "" said Steve Whitmore , spokesman for the LA county sheriff 's department .
"" The victim is desirous of prosecution . ""
While Ocean has asked police to investigate , it 's not certain that any charges will ultimately be laid : ""
There could have been some punches thrown .
It could have been shoving â€ ¦
[ But ] it could have been a minor scuffle that was a mutual exchange , "" Whitmore said .
"" We have no idea if anybody is going to be officially arrested . ""
Officials plan to speak to both Ocean and Brown , as well as to witnesses who observed the incident outside Westlake Studio .
Ocean has claimed that he was "" jumped by Chris and a couple guys "" after a dispute over a parking space .
Brown 's people say one of Ocean 's friends threw the first punch , as Brown went to shake Ocean 's hand .
All six of the brawlers had cleared out before police arrived at the scene . ""
Working on my album .
Not working on negativity , "" Brown wrote on Twitter .
He later posted a painting of himself as the crucified Jesus Christ . ""
Painting the way I feel today , "" he said .
But the singer 's lawyer has also apparently reached out to police , offering testimony and even part of a relevant CCTV video .
Attorney Mark Geragos claims the stars ' entourages , not the musicians themselves , were the ones fighting .
This is an important distinction : Brown is still on probation further to his assault of Rihanna , in 2009 .
Assuming no one is arrested , Ocean and Brown will face each other again at the 2013 Grammy awards .
Ocean is nominated for six awards at the 10 February gala , including the prize for best urban contemporary album , where Brown is also a nominee ."
"Rihanna has confirmed that she is back with her former boyfriend , Chris Brown , who assaulted her in 2009 .
"" Even if it 's a mistake , it 's my mistake , "" the 24-year - old singer said .
"" He made a mistake , and he 's paid his dues .
"" Rihanna 's interview , in the new issue of Rolling Stone , answers months of speculation about the pair 's reconciliation .
Over the past few months risquÃ
© tweets and paparazzi photographs suggested they were back together . ""
When you add up the pieces from the outside , it 's not the cutest puzzle in the world , "" Rihanna admitted . ""
[ But ] I was n't going to let anybody 's opinion get in the way of that . ""
"" I decided it was more important for me to be happy , "" she told the magazine . ""
After being tormented for so many years , being angry and dark , I 'd rather just live my truth and take the backlash â€
¦ Sometimes people need support and encouragement , instead of ridicule and criticism and bashing . ""
According to the police report about the events of 8 February 2009 , the couple argued after Rihanna discovered Brown had received a text from an ex - girlfriend .
Brown then assaulted the Umbrella singer .
Police were called when a witness heard her screams .
Though he initially denied the assault charges , Brown eventually pleaded guilty .
He was sentenced to one year 's probation and domestic violence counselling .
He has since been involved in violent incidents involving fans , interviewers , Drake and , last weekend , Frank Ocean .
But Rihanna insists Brown has changed . ""
He does n't have the luxury of fucking up again .
That 's just not an option , "" she said .
"" I would n't have gone this far if I ever thought that was a possibility

You see us walking somewhere , driving somewhere , in the studio , in the club , and you think you know .

"League One â€¢
The ridiculous weather made inroads into an already reduced Football League programme but the leaders Doncaster Rovers ' derby at Scunthorpe United survived the cut and Brian Flynn 's side took advantage to go five points clear at the top with a 3 - 2 win .
A David Mirfin own goal after five minutes gave the visitors a lead that was doubled six minutes before the break by Iain Hume .
Mark Duffy hit back within two minutes for Scunthorpe but Chris Brown made it 3 - 1 three minutes after the break .
Karl Hawley 's late goal reduced the deficit but Rovers held on .
â€¢ Inconsistency continues to dog the leading sides in League One , however , with Swindon Town held to a goalless draw by Notts County , although the point took them into second place on goal difference above Brentford , whose big match at Sheffield United was postponed .
Bournemouth , who have regained some form after their recent wobble , thrashed Bury 4 - 1 to move into fourth place .
â€¢ Carlisle gave Yeovil 's play - off challenge another jolt with two injury - time goals to snatch a 3 - 3 draw at Brunton Park .
The Glovers ' post - Christmas charge up the table has been checked in recent weeks
but they looked on course for victory when Kevin Dawson , the prolific Paddy Madden and James Hayter put them 3 - 1 ahead .
However , Lee Miller 's second goal of the match and a Luke Ayling own goal brought Carlisle a point .
â€¢
In the clash of the crisis clubs at Fratton Park , a resurgent if still almost certainly relegation - bound Portsmouth beat Coventry City , who face being put into administration this week , 2 - 0 thanks to goals from Jed Wallace and Patrick Agyemang .
Representatives of the two clubs ' supporters trusts were due to meet up before the game to compare notes and discuss how fans can respond to financial meltdown .
League positions notwithstanding , optimism is probably higher at Pompey at present as the trust edges closer to securing a deal to take control of the club , whereas Coventry 's situation is mired in confusion , with staff being told to vacate the Ricoh Arena on Friday after the owner Sisu put a non - operating subsidiary , CCFC Ltd , into administration on Thursday .
â€¢ Portsmouth 's win dumps Hartlepool United , who drew 0 - 0 at home to Walsall , back on the bottom .
League Two â€¢ There was more action of consequence at the bottom than the top but the leaders Gillingham were able to stretch their advantage to eight points with an unspectacular 1 - 0 win over Accrington .
Matt Fish scored the Gills ' winner in front of more than 10,000 at Priestfield .
â€¢
It continues to be almost impossibly tight at the bottom of League Two .
Accrington 's defeat keeps them in trouble third from bottom , though the bottom two were unable to make any ground .
Aldershot 's game at Port Vale was called off while York City lost 1 - 2 at Torquay United , who are now four games unbeaten , their calamitous slide down the table since new year having been halted .
Torquay also survived the dismissal of Tom Cruise ( no , not that one ) 17 minutes from time .
AFC Wimbledon continue to edge closer to safety â€ “ their 2 - 0 victory over Morecambe was their fourth win in five ."
"There comes a time , usually once one has reached a certain level of wealth , fame and publicly sponsored indolence , when one is overwhelmed by the irresistible urge to give something back , to show some appreciation to the little people .
This usually takes the form of celebrity activism , the spectrum of which ranges from Bono - esque worthiness at one end to a quickfire tweet informing your followers of your commitment to calling out injustice on the other ( see Chris Brown 's reaction to the deeply uncool events in Syria : # HoulaMassacre OMG ! ! ! ! !
Not cool !
Alas , we have n't time to discuss this particular form of internet celebrity slacktivism today .
I 'm opting instead for the good , old - fashioned kind , but I do feel that it should be noted that lovable scamp Justin Bieber is well known for taking time out from feasting on the brains of teenage girls while rolling a fat one to fire off the odd tweet about organ donation . )
The knowledge that fashionable ginger and grande dame of the punk movement Vivienne Westwood has switched her allegiances from the climate change movement to Virgin Atlantic has hit me harder than any previous news story ever , including the death of Princess Diana , a woman with whom three generations of women in my family are obsessed .
Of course , as Diana knew painfully , accusations of hypocrisy as far as celebrity charity work is concerned are nothing new .
Indeed , one could see this as a repeat of the Trudie Styler private jet brouhaha , or the time Naomi Campbell crassly demonstrated to the world that , actually , she 'd rather wear fur and extremely unethical diamonds than be naked .
And yet , I had higher hopes for Vivienne , whose commitment to saving the world I felt was matched only by her talent for corsetry that make one 's tits look amazing .
That she is now designing uniforms for a company whose fossil fuel consumption could very well outstrip that of a small principality , possibly Wales , not to mention one whose persistently sexist advertising implies that the ability of its female staff to wear shoes and apply lipstick constitute magical superpowers , is a source of almost infinite disappointment to me .
I may be something of a naÃ¯f , but I retained some faith in the simple , kind - hearted nature of celebrities until this moment .
Perhaps it was being shown a badly dubbed VHS copy of Live Aid at a young and tender age , or perhaps it was seeing Sean Penn face a heroic race against time when his Hurricane Katrina rescue boat began to sink .
Or perhaps it 's because I 'm a Guardianista .
Whatever the reason , that small spark of belief in the fundamental goodness of people has been bluntly snuffed out , only to be replaced with the pervading belief that no one in the public eye is capable of doing anything remotely philanthropic without there being a smidgeon of self - promotion among their motives .
Yes , even Kim Kardashian .
Even Angelina Jolie ."
"Chris Brown has found himself embroiled in yet another row , this time with his neighbours .
The controversial R&amp;B star has painted an outside wall of his Beverly Hills mansion with a garish , street art - style mural depicting colourful monsters with sharp teeth .
And neighbours are complaining that it is lowering the tone and scaring local children .
Patti Negri , president of the Hollywood Dell Civic Association , told the LA Times : "" There are lots of babies , lots of children , and they 're literally frightened .
It 's like devils on the wall
â€ “ big scary eyes and big scary teeth , and just the whole vibe is not what we 're used to . ""
LA City Code officials have already responded to complaints , ordering Brown to remove the paintings and fining him $ 376 ( Â£244 ) for "" unpermitted and excessive signage "" .
The figure could rise if he does not comply within 30 days .
"" I know a $ 300 fine is probably pocket change , "" Ms Negri added .
"" But hopefully and maybe , he 'll just see the light and decide to be a good neighbour .
We 're happy to have him â€ “ if he just tones it down . ""
But it looks unlikely that her wishes will be heeded .
Brown 's lawyer Mark Geragos has already hit back at the actions of what he calls "" busybodies "" , saying the neighbours are waging a campaign of continual harassment against the singer .
He said : "" I 'm scared of neighbourhood busybodies like this .
They 've called animal control .
They have sicced parking [ enforcement ] on him , and now they reached the heights of ridiculousness here .
Shame on them .
"" This is not the first time Brown 's taste in artwork has landed him in hot water .
Last year he was widely criticised for a tattoo that some took to resemble a battered woman .
The singer insisted that the image was inspired by the Mexican day of thedead festival ."
"I know what you 're thinking .
We 've all been thinking it , but nobody has spoken out : we follow him on Twitter , on Facebook , on Instagram and YouTube , but there are simply too few opportunities to observe persistent pop clown Chris Brown making dizzyingly self - righteous pronouncements while gurning with his shirt off .
Well , exciting news arrived in my inbox on Wednesday evening
: the Chris Brown Channel App is now available for iPhone , iPad and iPod touch , and this crushing blow for Android users is great news for the rest of us .
Before we explore the "" user journey "" associated with said app , the understated press release is itself a work of wonder . ""
The Chris Brown Channel encompasses all facets of the Grammy - winning singer / songwriter , artist , actor and model , "" it underplays , "" from music to art , style to philanthropy .
"" Time and space constraints must surely be reason for the release neglecting to detail all those other endeavours that continue to make Brown such a beloved pop - cultural figurehead .
"" I am so excited to get closer to my fans â€ “ to bring them into my world , hearing from me directly , in my own words wherever I am , whenever they want , "" adds Chris , or someone pretending to be Chris in order to flesh out a press release with curiously un - Breezylike lexical nuances .
"" Through my channel app they can be part of my music , my art and my life , day in and day out . ""
Well it seems like there will be a lot of art in this app ,
so let 's install it and see what 's what .
An early piece of good news is that it 's free , presumably because one can simply not put a price on art , and after installation there is an instant alert that "" ' Chris Brown ' would like to send you push notifications "" , which sounds not unlike advance warning of a classic Brown altercation , perhaps in a car park .
And who 's to say we wo n't be treated to blow - by - blow accounts of just such high - spirited escapades ?
Apparently this app gives Chris "" the capacity to broadcast live "" , meaning that he "" controls the content , both planned and spontaneous "" .
This is excellent news for Brown , because this perpetually misunderstood visionary can finally show the world that none of the unfortunate scenarios in which he routinely finds himself are actually his fault .
We are also promised that fans "" will be able to interact with Chris , take part in polls ( potentially even choosing which song he sings first for a show ) "" .
This promise of fan interaction suggests a high degree of Truman Show - style control , and could have a hugely positive effect on Brown 's future .
Imagine , for instance , that before graffiti - ing the exterior of his house with a series of pathetic goblins â€ “ as he did earlier this week , to the annoyance of neighbours â€ “ Brown asked his fans for advice .
Perhaps they 'd simply say : "" No Chris , do n't do that , just go back to those thoughtful musings about ' wife - ing ' Rihanna "" .
In practice , of course , his fans would probably go for the goblins and request that he did a dump on his neighbour 's lawn while he was at it , because fans throwing themselves into this hermetically sealed world will be where Chris Brown 's â€ “ and please excuse the inadequacy of these quote marks â€ “ "" values "" are the law .
Fifteen years ago , any star like Brown hoping to get their message out to the public was faced with two effective options .
They could throw themselves upon the mercy of the media and hope that the message they hoped to communicate somehow made it past the journalist 's own agenda and into the final edit , or they could pay to get the message across in an advertisement .
In 2013 , direct - to - fan communications , like these apps and the varied wonders of social media , reduce the media 's stranglehold to the level of an optimistic hug .
This is perfect for celebrities .
If you 're Katy Perry , why would you announce a new album through a music magazine or media outlet with a paltry 180,000 Twitter followers , when you can whack a message on Twitter and know it will instantly hit more than 36 million fans ?
Equally , there 's no type of pre - emptive press regulation quite like knowing that the ludicrously overblown piece of fiction regarding Millie Mackintosh you are about to send to press will be instantly rubbished by Professor Green , but while the idea of unmediated celebrity truth is rather useful if you happen to be the celebrity in question , Brown 's app ( which promises "" engagement between consumers , celebrities and brands "" ) will surely follow the lead of those guest columns celebrities regularly offer to celeb weeklies , more often than not a self - serving cocktail of plugs for upcoming projects , crowbarred - in references to current endorsement deals , and mock - outraged denials regarding stories running in competing publications .
Resistance to this power shift is n't the desperate grasping of someone whose job often involves standing between musician and fan shouting about the things neither party wants to acknowledge â€ “ well , it 's not just that â€ “ and perhaps Brown 's app will actually establish that he 's a great chap with a broad and genuine interest in art and philanthropy .
But it 's difficult to embrace the concept of a news agenda that comes solely from the horse 's mouth â€ “ whether that horse be Brown or David Cameron .
Not even if they happen to be shirtless ."
"A minor car crash could send Chris Brown to jail .
Officials are allegedly investigating whether Brown violated the terms of his probation last week after he hit another vehicle in Los Angeles .
According to a report on the gossip blog TMZ , the LA is looking into the claim that Brown refused to co - operate with the victim of a minor crash on 21 May.
Although the star did not dispute his Range Rover bumped the back of her Mercedes - Benz , he was apparently reluctant to hand over his insurance details or driving permit number .
The 24-year - old also "" copped an attitude when the woman pressed him for his [ information ] "" .
When Brown did finally oblige her , TMZ claims he gave her false information .
If this is true , Brown could be in very hot water .
The R&amp;B singer is still under probation for his 2009 assault against Rihanna .
According to TMZ , if he refused to disclose correct insurance information , he would be in breach of his probation terms â€ “ and could face a jail sentence of up to four years .
In a statement to TMZ , "" sources close to "" Brown denied he had lied about his insurance information and provided a photo of the victim 's car , showing no signs of damage . ""
When his lawyer attempted to contact [ the other driver ] not long after the accident , she hung up on him , "" the sources claimed .
They insisted Brown has not been contacted by police .
This would n't be Brown 's only recent brush with controversy .
In February an LA judge questioned whether Brown completed the six months ' community labour sentence imposed as part of his five - year probation .
A report by the LAdistrict attorney 's office found that there was "" no credible , competent or verifiable evidence that defendant Brown performed his community labour "" .
A further hearing is scheduled for 10 June .
Brown 's last album , 2012 's Fortune , topped the UK album charts ."
"Chris Brown collapsed on Friday morning , suffering a seizure while working at a Los Angeles recording studio .
The 24-year - old singer reportedly refused immediate treatment for the attack , which his doctor blamed on "" intense fatigue and extreme emotional stress "" .
Tabloids began reporting about the seizure on Friday afternoon , spurring fans to tweet "" # PrayForChrisBrown "" .
Brown 's reps did n't confirm the incident until Friday night , using the opportunity to criticise the media 's "" negative "" focus on the R&amp;B star 's 2009 assault of his then girlfriend , Rihanna . ""
Chris suffered a non - epileptic seizure ( NES ) , "" they wrote . ""
His doctor tended to him this afternoon and attributes the NES to intense fatigue and extreme emotional stress , both due to the continued onslaught of unfounded legal matters and the nonstop negativity . ""
Although Brown 's new album , X , is due out later this month , the Turn Up the Music singer 's ongoing legal woes may have a far bigger impact on his career .
Brown is accused of violating his probation on 21 May , when he got into a minor car crash .
Prosecutors claim that the musician left the scene without giving the victim his personal information and insurance details , which would make it a hit and run .
As part of the proceedings , Brown spent a self - imposed 44 minutes in jail last week , but could serve up to four years if convicted .
"" They wo n't love u until u r a memory , "" Brown tweeted on Saturday .
His most recent record , 2012 's Fortune , debuted at No 1 ."
"Chris Brown has emerged unscathed from a hit - and - run case that threatened to see him jailed for four years .
A judge dismissed the last of the charges relating to a car crash in May , stating that Brown had come to a "" civil compromise "" with the victim .
Los Angeles superior court judge
Christine Ewell rejected the hit - and - run charge despite objections from the prosecution , who pointed to Brown 's aggression at the scene of the crash .
After running into a Mercedes driven by Olga Gure - Kovalenko , Brown reportedly refused to hand over his driver 's permit or insurance information , and referred to Kovalenko as a "" bitch "" .
Despite these early offences , the singer did eventually provide Kovalenko with the correct information .
Accordingly , LA city attorneys recently dropped the misdemeanor charges of driving without a licence and driving without insurance ; only the hit - and - run allegation remained .
Because of Brown 's probation status , prosecutors argued , it was much more serious that he had left the scene without giving Kovalenko his details .
But judge Ewell saw Brown and Kovalenko 's undisclosed "" compromise "" as sufficient grounds to dismiss the hit - and - run charge . ""
The case never should have been filed in the first place , "" said Brown 's lawyer , Mark Geragos .
Although details of the settlement were not released , he insisted Kovalenko had not been paid any money apart from insurance compensation for damage to her vehicle . ""
[ Brown was ] being prosecuted for who he is rather than what he 's done , "" Geragos said .
While Brown is no longer threatened by this particular case , he remains at the centre of at least two legal disputes .
Later today , he is scheduled to appear at a hearing over allegations that he has violated his probation through several offences , including the falsification of community service hours .
Brown was also recently sued by Sha'keir Duarte , an associate of Frank Ocean , who claims he was assaulted during a fight with members of Brown 's entourage .
"" You just got your ass beat , "" Brown allegedly told him .
Duarte is seeking punitive damages for battery , assault , intentional infliction of emotional distress , and conspiracy to commit battery .
Brown , who recently suffered a seizure due to "" extreme emotional stress "" , is due to release a new album later this month .
He has announced it will be his second - last ."
"After more than a decade of rapping about selling cocaine , you might think Pusha T would be running out of white - lined road .
But on the Marlo Stanfield - quoting , Kanye West - backed
My Name Is My Name
, Pusha manages to subtly reposition himself as a chart - ready street bard ( while still weaving in the obligatory references to blow ) .
His guests ease the transition , with pop acts ( Chris Brown ) , dial - a - verse rappers ( 2 Chainz , Rick Ross ) and Kanye 's meandering Auto - Tune helping to give the album a clean sheen that was n't present during his grimier Clipse period .
But MNIMN works best when Pusha gets his hands dirty , goes into storyteller mode and hooks up with old pals such as Pharrell , who continues his 2013 midas touch on the cautionary tale S.N.I.T.C.H. Pusha sounds equally comfortable when showing off his lyrical dexterity on Suicide and Nosetalgia ( geddit ? ) , which features a verse from Kendrick Lamar and plays out like a game of drug - dealing top trumps ."
"The singer Chris Brown and a man reported to be his bodyguard have been arrested and charged with felony assault .
Washington police said the two men were involved in an altercation with another man early on Sunday morning .
The other man arrested and charged was named as Chris Hollosy , 35 .
Brown and Hollosy were being held in police custody until Monday , DC police spokesman Paul Metcalf said .
Brown 's publicists and attorney , Mark Geragos , did not immediately respond to messages left early Sunday .
Officer Andrew Clay of the Metropolitan police department said he could not confirm Hollosy 's relationship with Brown .
The altercation occurred outside the W Hotel , which is located on K and 15th street , near the White House , at around 4:25am .
Washington police did not immediately release details of the other man involved , other than to say "" he 's alive "" .
It was later confirmed that he had been released from hospital .
Brown , 24 , is currently on probation in California , for a domestic violence conviction involving his former girlfriend , Barbadian singer Rihanna .
He was first arrested in 2009 .
Violation of that probation could result in time in jail .
In August , he was ordered to complete 1,000 hours of community service , over probation violation .
Also in August , Brown settled a hit - and - run case that had threatened to send him to jail , after a car crash in May.
Brown was reported to have come to a "" civil compromise "" with the victim .
In the same month , he suffered a seizure ."

"When Miley Cyrus sparked up a "" suspicious cigarette "" on stage at Amsterdam 's Ziggo Dome during the MTV Europe music awards , it was a move that surprised precisely no one , but made sure that her acceptance speech had to be excised from the US broadcast .
As a resident of the Netherlands ' capital , such stoned celeb dispatches â€ “ think Lady Gaga inhaling on stage in September 2012 at the same arena , Rihanna tweeting pictures of herself apparently enjoying biftas the size of the Hubble Space Telescope , and Chris Brown following suit
â€ “ are a personal bÃªte noir .
Lately it seems that anyone with a tour to promote who comes within spitting distance of Schiphol airport is encouraged by their PR manager to make directly for the nearest cafe and tweet endless grainy , half - lit images of themselves toking from a massive blunt preferably modelling a loose - knit hat inspired by the Jamaican flag and proclaiming : "" Amsterdam is da best lolz # yolo "" .
It must stop immediately .
And this is why .
First of all , it 's as nakedly attention - seeking as a Kardashian belfie , both for the celebs and for the coffee shops who â€ “ forbidden from promoting themselves through the traditional channels
â€ “ indulge them with herbal freebies galore .
Which , frankly , is mutually parasitic and deeply unfair on the rest of us .
What 's more , if you are accepting an award at the MTV awards , you are essentially at work and should behave accordingly .
And believe me , there 's nothing more tedious than a stoned colleague .
When I edited Time Out Amsterdam magazine , reliable coffee shop reviewers were extremely hard to find .
As Cher Horowitz , protagonist of the film Clueless , and my personal go - to in matters of taste and decency , puts it while initiating her younger charge into the social mores of Beverly Hills : "" It is one thing to spark up a doobie and get laced at parties .
It is quite another to be fried all day "" .
If I 've paid 60-plus quid plus car rental to see Rihanna gyrate her way down a moving walkway in Arnhem , I 'd rather she showed up in a timely manner , and did n't give the impression she was pie - eyed throughout her rendition of Diamonds .
I am no clean - living prude .
Weed - dispensing coffee shops in Amsterdam â€ “ like off - licences in the UK and meth labs in Albuquerque â€ “ can be pillars of the community .
Many a time have I kicked back in my friendly neighbourhood drug den after a punishing day at the word processor .
I hate to say it , but spending lost hours holed up in a red - light district flophouse â€ “ and broadcasting one 's presence there
â€ “ is the surest way to mark oneself out as a daft tourist , blind to the myriad cultural treasures that Amsterdam has to offer , which includes everything from the recently reopened Rijksmuseum to a gallery devoted to the artistic veneration of cats .
The latest generation of celebrities seem to have ignored the memo that the occasional cheeky spliff is a fun end - of - day indulgence , whereas spending large portions of the day out of your tree is the equivalent of standing in the middle of a cycle lane , damp map flapping in the drizzle , whilst belching out a request for directions to the Hard Rock Cafe .
We all need a release , and there is doubtless a valid case to be made for ending the futile worldwide war on drugs and the myriad benefits of decriminalisation .
But Amsterdam does n't necessarily have all of the answers .
Over - the - counter sales to customers are "" tolerated "" , whereas the wholesale supply to the coffee shops is almost completely unregulated .
Dutch law perpetuates the dumb fantasy that vast supplies of ganja miraculously arrive in the storeroom overnight
â€ “ meaning mom - and - pop coffee shop owners have to consort with big - time criminals in order to keep going .
One thing 's for sure , though : if legalisation is the way ahead , we need more convincing ambassadors .
Or at least ones that can keep their tongues in their mouths ."
"After spending two weeks at a residential rehabiltation facility , Chris Brown has checked himself out .
The singer will continue his programme as an outpatient , his attorney said , while also undertaking community service in accordance with a court order .
Brown revealed neither the name of the rehabilitation facility he entered on 29 October nor details of the treatment he would be receiving .
In a statement , his publicist said : "" His goal is to gain focus and insight into his past and recent behaviour , enabling him to continue the pursuit of his life and his career from a healthier vantage point "" .
Initial reports claimed Brown might spend up to three months at the facility .
Brown 's lawyer , Mark Geragos , emphasised that it was solely his client 's decision to seek help . ""
[ Chris ] said , ' I want to take some time and do a little introspection and understand everything that 's going on around me ' , "" Geragos told the New York Daily News . ""
He should be applauded . ""
The move to enter rehab came just days after Brown , 24 , was charged in connection with another alleged assault .
He has pleaded not guilty to attacking a man outside a hotel in Washington DC .
The charges were recently reduced from felony assault to misdemeanor .
Brown is on probation for the 2009 assault of Rihanna , who was his girlfriend at the time .
He has since been linked to a series of altercations , including a punch - up with Frank Ocean , a brawl with Drake , and the alleged theft of a fan 's iPhone .
None of these incidents resulted in a conviction .
In August , Brown suffered a seizure during a Los Angeles recording session ; a spokesperson said his doctor attributed the incident to "" intense fatigue and extreme emotional stress "" brought on "" [ by ] the continued onslaught of unfounded legal matters and the non - stop negativity "" .
Brown will next appear in court for a probation hearing on 20 November .
Five days later , he will appear before a judge in connection with the assault case .
The singer 's sixth studio album , X , is expected early next year .
His previous LP , 2012 's Fortune , debuted at number one ."
"Chris Brown has been sent back to rehab .
Less than a week after being expelled from an anger management centre in Malibu , the singer has been ordered by a court to seek immediate treatment at a three - month residential programme .
In addition to counselling at a court - approved facility , Brown has agreed to submit to regular drug tests .
He will be permitted to leave the rehab centre only three times a week , contributing day - long shifts toward his 1,000-hour community labour sentence .
In an agreement between prosecutors , Brown 's lawyer and Los Angeles County superior court judge James Brandlin , the singer was also given permission to fly to Washington DC for an assault hearing next Monday .
It also emerged at yesterday 's hearing that rather than voluntarily leaving his last rehabilitation programme , Brown was actually ejected in mid - November .
After just over a week at the facility , Brown became violent during a family counselling session , the LA Times revealed : he left a meeting with his mother and threw a rock through her car window .
Although the window shattered , no one was hurt .
At the time , Brown 's attorney , Mark Geragos , said his client had simply decided to pursue outpatient therapy .
For Brown , all of this is a bid to avoid jail time .
The 24-year - old is still under supervision following his attack on then - girlfriend Rihanna in 2009 , and several subsequent incidents have risked violating the terms of his probation .
Brown and his bodyguard are currently accused of fighting with a photographer outside a hotel in Washington .
Brown denies the charge .
Judge Brandlin has asked a probation officer to monitor this assault case , filing a detailed report when Brown returns to court on 16 December ."
"Chris Brown is being sued for allegedly attacking one of his opponents at a basketball game last July .
The singerâ€ ™ s lawyer claims Brown is being extorted by Malcolm Ausbon , who said he was â€œjumped and beatenâ€ � by the star and his entourage .
Although the incident dates from 29 July 2013 , Ausbon only filed his lawsuit last week , seeking unspecified damages for assault , battery , intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence .
The decision to go to a judge followed Brownâ€ ™ s refusal to negotiate a private settlement .
â€œI was talking to [ them ] and they didnâ€ ™ t want to communicate anymore , â€ �
Ausbonâ€ ™ s lawyer , Stephen Wegman , told the New York Daily News .
â€œIf Chris Brown isnâ€ ™ t willing to compensate [ my client ] for what he did to him , Iâ€ ™ m not going to back down.â€
�
The lawyer for Brown , Mark Geragos , has described this as â€œextortionâ€ � , according to an interview with TMZ .
Geragos alleges that in a meeting last August , Ausbonâ€ ™ s then - attorney admitted that Brown â€œnever touched his clientâ€ � .
There is apparently video from the fight that shows the attacker had dreadlocks â€ “ which Brown does not .
Nevertheless , Ausbonâ€ ™ s
lawsuit does not claim that Brown acted alone .
The alleged altercation took place during a game at North Hollywoodâ€ ™ s 24 Hour Fitness gym , when Ausbon and Brown got into an argument about a foul .
After Ausbon â€œexpressed his dissatisfactionâ€ � , Brown is said to have announced that he is a member of the Bloods street gang .
Ausbon was then approached by three members of Brownâ€ ™ s entourage , who said , â€œIf you fuck with Chris , you fuck with usâ€ � .
They then began to â€œstrike , punch , kick , pull and stompâ€ � his face and body .
A representative for Brown has since told TMZ : â€œChris is not affiliated with a gang or any similar organisation .
He is affiliated with the Symphonic Love Foundation and other organisations that strive to bring love , hope and the arts to children in need.â€ �
In the subsequent tussle , Ausbon allegedly ended up with a fractured rib , cuts and bruises all over his body , and a handful of conditions : post - traumatic stress disorder , distorted vision , dizziness , nervousness , fear and anxiety .
â€œImagine going to play a game of basketball , and you get jumped by four guys because you call a foul , â€ � Wegman said .
â€œThis isnâ€ ™ t for fame or fortune .
Heâ€
™ s got medical bills and issues as a result of some famous guy thinking heâ€ ™ s above the law.â€ � Brown is currently on a 90-day programme for anger management , as ordered by the court .
Almost five years after his assault on Rihanna , Brownâ€ ™ s probation was temporarily revoked , in December , following a fight in Washington , DC .
He is due back in court on 28 February .
â€¢
This article was amended on 18 February 2014 .
It wrongly stated : â€œGeragos alleges that in a meeting last August , Wegman admitted that Brown â€˜never touched his client.â€ ™ â€ � Wegman was not Ausbonâ€ ™ s attorney at that time .
This has been corrected ."
"Chris Brown has been ordered to remain in his anger management and drug rehabilitation programme for another two months .
Although the singer has reportedly responded well to therapy , a Los Angeles judge has instructed him to continue receiving full - time treatment until he stands trial for assault , in April .
Brown cut a serene figure at Fridayâ€ ™ s court hearing , CNN reported , appearing healthy and even seeming to meditate during a pause in proceedings .
The 24-year - old â€œcontinues to make great
improvementâ€ �
, his parole officer told the judge , attending six to eight therapy sessions each week and passing all of his drug tests .
But Brown is also allegedly grappling with serious issues : â€œOur clinical team believes Mr Brown became aggressive and acted out physically due to [ an ] untreated mental health disorder , severe sleep deprivation , inappropriate self - medicating and [ post - traumatic stress disorder],â€ �
wrote officials from Brownâ€ ™ s luxury rehab facility .
He is now learning â€œbehavioural strategiesâ€ � and â€œrelaxation exercisesâ€ � to help him manage his â€œimpulsive behavioursâ€ � .
Since first checking into rehab , in November , Brown has already left and been sent back once .
He has also had his probation revoked twice in the past 12 months .
Even as he receives treatment , Brown is spending about three days a week on community service duty â€ “ tidying highways as part of the sentence from his 2009 attack on Rihanna .
About 750 hours of labour still remain to be fulfilled .
Brown also risks being sent to jail through a couple of different means .
In mid - April , he will stand trial for allegedly attacking a 20-year - old student in Washington , DC last autumn .
Regardless of the outcome of that case , Los Angeles county judge James Brandlin will rule separately , on 23 April , whether Brown must go to jail for violating his probation .
â€œNever really goes the way u plan .
# LIFE , â€ �
Brown tweeted on Friday .
His sixth album , X , is scheduled to be released on 5 May."
"Chris Brown has been ordered to remain in jail until 23 April following his second ejection from an anger management programme in Malibu .
Despite the pleas of Brownâ€ ™ s attorney , judge James Brandlin ruled that the singer must stay behind bars until a ruling can be made on whether he violated the terms of his probation .
Brown has been in and out of rehab since November , seeking treatment for anger management while completing community service duty for his 2009 assault of Rihanna .
He was first kicked out of the program after just two weeks , when the 24-year - old threw a rock through his motherâ€ ™ s car window following a family therapy session .
He returned shortly thereafter and appeared to be making progress : â€œ[Chris is ] able to use behavioural strategies to manage acting out on impulsesâ€ � , the program director said earlier this month .
â€œOur clinical team believes ...
[ he ] acted out physically due to [ an ] untreated mental health disorder , severe sleep deprivation , inappropriate self - medicating and [ post - traumatic stress
disorder].â€ �
That changed last week .
Per judge Brandlin , Brown violated the rehab programmeâ€ ™ s rules by reportedly failing to take a drug test , making threats , and touching a woman at the centre .
He was arrested on Friday and kept in jail over the weekend .
In court yesterday , Brownâ€ ™ s attorney complained that Brownâ€ ™ s violations donâ€ ™ t warrant jail without bail .
According to the LA Times , Mark Geragos contested the allegation that Brown had failed a drug test and claimed that â€œthe only touching ... involved the elbows of a femaleâ€ � .
Although he did not deny that Brown had boasted , in a morning reflection session , about his skills â€œ[with ] guns and knivesâ€ � , he said that Brown should not have to censor himself during therapy .
Brownâ€ ™ s fate rests , in large part , on the outcome of a trial in Washington , DC , which is due to begin on 17 April .
He is accused of attacking a 20-year - old student who tried to take his photograph last October .
While Brownâ€ ™ s sixth album , X , is still penciled - in for May 2014 , his new single has been officially postponed .
Donâ€ ™ t Be Gone
Too Long , a duet with Ariana Grande , will no longer come out on 24 March .
â€œObviously some things have changed recently , â€ � Grande tweeted yesterday .
â€œMy duet partner isnâ€ ™ t available at the moment to put the song out with me.â€ � A new release date has yet to be confirmed ."

"Chris Brown has been sentenced to one year in jail in connection with a fight in Washington last autumn .
Having already served 234 days in rehab and custody , the R&amp;B singer was ordered to remain behind bars for only 131 days more after admitting to having violated his probation .
"" We 're gratified that he was not sentenced to state prison , gratified that he 's still on probation , "" Brown 's lawyer , Mark Geragos , told CNN on Friday .
Although the sentence could technically extend until mid - September , Geragos predicted his client would be released over the weekend , due to good behaviour .
"" If he is n't out by Monday , then I would expect he 's getting special treatment , "" he said .
"" [ Chris has ] over 230 days credit on a 365 [ day sentence ] and generally the sheriff is releasing on a lot less than that . ""
As of Sunday night , it did not appear that Brown had been set free .
Despite Friday 's decision , Brown is not actually finished with this assault case .
Technically , he was sentenced for violating probation â€ “ probation that stems from his 2009 attack on then - girlfriend Rihanna .
The singer is still expected to stand trial over his confrontation with a 20-year - old student , last October .
Whenever Brown is released , he has other obligations ahead of him .
He must serve 700 hours of community labour at a rate of at least three days per week , in addition to a programme of weekly anger management and family counselling sessions .
The 25-year - old will also be expected to undergo random drug tests .
"" I think that Chris has learned quite a bit through this experience
and I 'm anxious to see how he does , as I think everybody else is , "" Geragos said .

"Despite having the results of physical brutality in front of our eyes , when it comes to violence against women , seeing , sadly , is still not believing .
On Monday , adult film actress Christy Mack took to Twitter and posted pictures of herself bruised and battered â€ “ allegedly the result of a beating that she said she received from her ex - boyfriend , Jon Koppenhaver , a mixed martial arts fighter who goes by the name War Machine .
Along with the pictures , she tweeted her account of the attack , writing that Koppenhaver beat her , forced her to undress and shower in front of him , threatened to rape her ( but couldnâ€ ™ t get aroused ) , chopped off her hair with a knife , and stabbed her .
Mack says her injuries include 18 broken bones , various lesions and missing teeth .
Koppenhaver is under investigation by Las Vegas police in connection to the beating , but has posted a â€œdefenseâ€ � of himself on Twitter ( where his bio reads simply :
â€œI do Alpha Male
shitâ€ � ) .
Koppenhaver claims in his tweets that he went to Mackâ€
™ s house intending to propose but found her there with another man .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not a bad guy ,
â€ � he tweeted .
In response , some fans offered words of encouragement , saying â€œeveryone deserves fair treatmentâ€ � , and that â€œwe donâ€ ™ t know all the factsâ€ � .
Others suggested that it was actually Koppenhaver who was attacked .
Mack is not the first reasonably well - known woman to use social media in this manner .
Women are laying bare the violence done to them using the best technology they have at their disposal : social media .
But in the 1980s , the biggest technological breakthrough for survivors of domestic violence was the instant camera .
Esta Soler , founder of Futures Without Violence , said in her 2013 TEDWomen talk that after activists would go to the emergency room for what the police called â€œa loversâ€ ™ quarrel , â€ � they would â€œtake our Polaroid camera , we would take her picture , we would wait 90 seconds , and we would give her the photograph.â€ �
â€œAnd she would then have the evidence she needed to go to court .
We were making what was invisible visible.â€ �
Decades after the Polaroid , domestic violence victims have proof for the world ( and , perhaps later , for the courts ) : this is still happening .
But sometimes the internet shines a harsh spotlight on domestic violence even when victims donâ€ ™ t want the world to know the specifics ( or that it happened at all ) .
Last month , after Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice knocked his wife unconscious , a video of him dragging her limp body out of an elevator went viral .
Last year , pictures of celebrity chef and author Nigella Lawson distressed , her husband Charles Saatchiâ€ ™
s hands around her neck
, hit the web .
And , of course , no one could ever forget the leaked 2009 images of singer Rihannaâ€ ™ s beaten face after she was attacked by then - boyfriend Chris Brown .
But even those stark images werenâ€ ™ t enough for the world to rally behind these victims .
Rice was suspended for two games and settled charges with no jail time .
During a press conference , the Ravens tweeted out that Riceâ€ ™ s wife Janay , â€œdeeply regrets the role that she played the night of the incidentâ€ � .
Saatchi accepted a police caution for assault , and the media â€ “ including one Australian DJ who demanded that Lawson make a stand on domestic violence â€ “ followed victim - blaming suit .
( There was even a Saatchi - like statue in a London gallery with which the public was encouraged to take pictures of themselves â€œbeing strangledâ€ � . )
Brown â€ “ who settled for community service in his case
â€ “ was widely forgiven by fans and music industry folks alike
â€ “ and a study of Boston teens showed that nearly half of them thought Rihanna was responsible for the physical abuse .
How is it that we donâ€ ™ t believe women , even when there is a preponderance of horrifying proof ?
Ruth Glenn , the interim Executive Director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence tells me that while victim - blaming has been around for a long time , weâ€ ™ re seeing it â€œexposed in its rawest formâ€
� online .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s so much anonymity in social media , so people can say what they really feel.â€
�
As to the safety of victims posting their stories online , Glenn says thatâ€ ™ s a matter of each individual case â€ “ and no one knows a womanâ€ ™ s danger level better than the women themselves .
â€œVictims have a right to do what they want , and what theyâ€ ™ ve assessed to be able make them safe ,
â€ � she says .
But survivors of domestic violence coming forward and using technology to tell their stories will only be safe , and their tactics effective , if we â€ “ the viewers
â€ “ believe them .
We have to , as a society and as individuals , stop protecting abusers and believing their protestations out of hand simply because theyâ€ ™ re famous , or charming â€ “ or because weâ€ ™ ve decided their victims arenâ€ ™ t sympathetic enough ( as though anyone could be ) .
Itâ€ ™ s time to stop making excuses .
Victims are showing us their truth , if weâ€ ™ re willing to open our eyes .

"The authors of a sensational book about the corrupt former New South Wales Labor politician Eddie Obeid will offer a formal apology after it was pulled from shelves due to defamation action by one of the bookâ€ ™ s subjects .
The best - selling book , He Who Must be Obeid , by journalists Kate McClymont and Linton Besser , alleged a former tourism taskforce ( TTF ) spokesman , Chris Brown , was â€œin businessâ€ � with the Obeids .
Brown said the authors â€ “ who also mentioned his father John Brown , a former Hawke minister â€ “ mistook him for another Chris Brown .
McClymont on Thursday tweeted â€œa formal apology to come re mistaken identityâ€ � .
Brown was confused with Christopher Geoffrey Charles Brown , who was born 19 years before Brown in England , Sydneyâ€ ™ s Daily Telegraph reported .
â€œThe great investigative journalists who wrote the book didnâ€ ™ t bother to take the four minutes to check the Asic website , â€ � Brown said .
Brown has hired the defamation lawyer Mark Oâ€ ™ Brien and is demanding a public apology , the ABC reported .
Oâ€ ™
Brien has previously acted for Obeid .
â€œMy legal team has injuncted the book , had it forced off the bookshelves and to be pulped , for a new edition to have corrections included , a public apology to be issued , and in due course for damages , obviously , to be lodged , â€ � Brown said .
The marketing and publicity director for Random House , Brett Osmond , told Australian Associated Press the book contained a â€œmis - identificationâ€ � .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve acted quickly , â€ �

"Chris Brown pleaded guilty on Tuesday to hitting a man outside a Washington hotel , an assault that occurred while the singer was on probation for attacking his then - girlfriend Rihanna .
Brown pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and was sentenced to time served .
He spent two days in a Washington jail in this case .
The Grammy - winning singer was arrested in October .
The victim told police Brown hit him after he tried to get in a picture the singer was taking with two women .
Brown had previously pleaded not guilty in the case .
His trial had been set for April , but it was delayed .
At the time of his Washington arrest , Brown was on probation in a felony assault case in California for attacking his then - girlfriend , pop star Rihanna , hours before the 2009 Grammy Awards .
Because Brown was still on probation , the outcome of his Washington case had potential repercussions in California .
During a court hearing in May , a Los Angeles judge sentenced Brown to serve an additional 131 days in jail .
He was released in June .
Brownâ€ ™ s attorney , Danny Onorato , argued that Brown had already been punished extensively for the assault , noting the time he spent in jail in California and four months he spent receiving inpatient counseling after his probation was revoked .
â€œTo say that heâ€ ™ s been punished severely in this matter is an understatement , â€ � Onorato said .
He said Brownâ€ ™ s career has been on hold for nearly a year and he wanted to take responsibility for his actions so he could go back to work , including a tour in support of a new album .
Brown spoke only briefly , saying : â€œI would like to say to the court that Iâ€ ™ m sorry.â€ �
He did not comment as he left court , swarmed by photographers and a handful of fans .
Brownâ€ ™ s bodyguard , Christopher Hollosy , was also charged in the same Washington scuffle .
He was accused of being the second person after Brown to strike Parker Adams outside the W hotel .
Hollosy was convicted of misdemeanor assault in April .
He has not yet been sentenced .
Brown , 24 , had a squeaky clean image before his attack on Rihanna , but since then he has had several flare - ups that have been reported to authorities and noted by Los Angeles prosecutors .
Brown broke a window after a 2011 â€œGood Morning Americaâ€ � interview in New York and was accused of snatching a womanâ€ ™ s cellphone in Miami after she tried to snap pictures of the singer .
He was also slightly injured in a New York nightclub brawl and , earlier this year , was accused of being involved in a fistfight with Frank Oceanâ€ ™ s entourage over a parking spot at a West Hollywood recording studio .
He was not charged in any of the incidents , but they have tarnished his public image , even as legions of fans continue to support him .
Many of Brownâ€ ™ s more than 13 million Twitter followers continue to come to the singerâ€ ™ s defense ."
"Despite decades of work , activism and policy around intimate partner violence , too many women are still beaten by the men they love .
The feminist response to high - profile public cases of domestic violence â€ “ like those of Chris Brown , who was convicted for brutally beating his then - girlfriend Rihanna in 2009 , or the NFL players Ray Rice , arrested on domestic violence charges in February , and Ray McDonald , who was just arrested on felony domestic violence charges for assaulting his fiancÃ
© e â€
“ is largely one of frustration .
Itâ€ ™ s aggravating to watch as the media props up abusers as â€œgood guysâ€ � , the victim - blaming that almost always follows , and the attendant lack of punishment for those who perpetrate violence .
But some advocates say that the focus of mainstream anti - violence organizations â€ “ relying on statistics , reporting assaults to police and putting offenders in prison â€ “ while well - meaning , may be part of the problem .
Grassroots activists believe this broad brush approach is a mistake , and instead are working on alternative methods , from restorative justice to iPhone apps , to tackle violence from a community mindset .
Mariame Kaba of the Chicago Taskforce on Violence Against Girls and Young Women tells me the current popular model for dealing with interpersonal violence â€ “ namely , the privileging of reporting assaults over community - based forms of activism â€ “ isnâ€ ™ t an effective long term solution .
â€œWe need to end violence rather than manage it , â€ � she told me .
Kaba particularly questions the efficacy of pushing women to rely on the criminal justice system , given its poor record in dealing with survivors and their role in oppressing marginalized communities .
â€œI want people to ask themselves if they think the way to end domestic violence is to rely on violent institutions , â€ � she said .
Many of the survivors Kaba works with â€ “ most of whom are young women of color â€ “ donâ€ ™ t want to involve the authorities .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re hesitant to call the police because of a historic negative interaction with law enforcement , â€ � Kaba explained .
â€œIf somebody does want to call the police , we would never say donâ€ ™ t call the police
â€ “ survivors need the ability to self - determine with their own choices.â€ �
Many younger and grassroots activists are seeking survivor - lead solutions to domestic violence that focus on community needs over reporting rates .
For example , YTH â€ “ an organization dedicated to improving the health of young people using technology â€ “ created a program called Unete Latina that connects Latina women in California to domestic violence services through their mobile phones .
Executive director Jamia Wilson says that , in cases of domestic violence , social media and technology can provide a sense of community and destigmatization .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a comfort in receiving services through your phone because of confidentiality , and itâ€ ™ s a low - cost way to get information , â€ �
Wilson told me .
She also says that the informal language used over mobile also put potential victims at ease : for instance , instead of texting users , â€œAre you a victim of domestic violence?â€ � , the service might ask , â€œDid your husband drink too much over the weekend?â€ � , thereby opening up a conversation .
Kaba sees this shifting focus less as a new model for dealing with domestic violence than a return to the original intention of anti - violence work , which was survivor - centered and rooted in peopleâ€ ™ s lived experiences .
â€œThis isnâ€ ™ t a theoretical exercise
, â€ � she said .
There are a lot of women who do want to report domestic violence to the police ; their wishes should be respected , and the criminal justice system should be better equipped to handle their needs ( more training and less victim - blaming would be a nice start ) .
But the questions that Kaba and other activists are asking about the efficacy of relying on the state rather than the community are becoming more and more relevant , because we need to do more than just run domestic violence through the criminal justice system after theyâ€ ™ ve been abused .
We need to end domestic violence entirely ."
"Lost in Showbiz likes to think of itself as a paragon of modesty and shy understatement .
It would never seek to self - aggrandise by claiming that it exerts a vast influence over the world of celebrity , that the famous hang on its every word , looking to it for guidance much as they would a guru or oracle , regarding its pronouncements as wisdom , spun from the purest gold , there to be acted upon with alacrity .
But sometimes , it does wonder .
Last week , Lost in Showbiz found itself forced to berate the worldâ€ ™ s celebrities for their woefully inadequate response to the Ebola outbreak .
It noted sorrowfully that , to date , hardly anyone from the glittering showbiz firmament had done or said anything idiotic .
Apparently forgetting themselves â€ “ and the vital role theyâ€ ™ re supposed to play in any crisis
â€ “ they had chosen to make a sober black and white fundraising video .
Clearly panicked and desperate , people had taken matters into their own hands and resorted to making idiotic things up , about R&amp;B singer Akon performing in a giant plastic anti - Ebola bubble etc .
Among the celebrities Lost in Showbiz called upon to act was R&amp;Bâ€ ™ s
best - loved domestic abuser Chris Brown , a man who suggested the 2011 riots might be quelled if people listened to his recent collaboration with pop - house DJ Benny Benassi , Beautiful People .
Itâ€ ™ s delighted to report that no sooner were its admonishing words published than a suitably chastened Chris Brown took to Twitter and informed his 13.7 million followers that , in his considered opinion , the Ebola epidemic was , in fact , â€œa form of population controlâ€ � .
No word , alas , as to whether he meant that it was the judgment of God upon an over - populated world or a crisis engineered by shadowy operatives of The Man â€ “ just the suggestion that â€œshit is getting crazyâ€ �
â€ “ but letâ€ ™ s not pick nits here .
Let us instead offer profound thanks that at least one celebrity has started doing their job properly , and hope that others follow his lead and buck their ideas up .
Indeed , the only drawback to the situation was that , 9,500 retweets later , Brown suggested he was going to â€œshut upâ€
� .
Lost in Showbiz can only clasp its head in its hands .
No , Chris Brown !
Donâ€ ™ t shut up !
At the moment , youâ€ ™ re our only hope !

"Neither Chris Brown nor his bodyguard will go to jail in connection with their assault of a man in October 2013 .
Although bodyguard Christopher Hollosy was convicted of misdemeanour assault and Brown pleaded guilty to misdemeanour assault and was sentenced to time served , a Washington , DC , superior court has ruled that they will not have to serve any more time behind bars .
On 16 December , Judge Patricia Wynn sentenced Christopher Hollosy to 90 days in jail for his misdemeanour assault of Parker Adams outside Washingtonâ€ ™ s W Hotel .
But Wynn also suspended the sentence , meaning that Hollosy remains free unless he violates his one - year probation .
Brown was also spared jail time : he pleaded guilty to the same charge in September , receiving a sentence of time served .
Brown and Hollosy both reportedly punched Adams when the fan tried to take a photo with the singer .
â€œIâ€ ™ m not down with that gay shit , â€ � Brown allegedly told Adams , according to a police report .
Adams was later treated for a fractured nose .
â€œThis all started over a photograph .
Something went wrong , â€ �
prosecutor Kendra Briggs told the Washington Post .
For Brown , the stakes were high : he is still on probation for his 2009 assault of Rihanna .
Hollosy asked for special dispensation from the judge , given that he had no prior criminal record and that he had recently been injured in a car crash .
â€œWe acknowledge what happened in this case , â€ � his lawyer said .
In addition to the criminal case , Adams also launched a civil suit against Brown and Hollosy , seeking $ 3 m ( Â£1.9 m ) in damages .
They settled for a reported $ 100,000 ( Â£64,000 ) in October ."

Brownâ€ ™ s caption on the photo - sharing website , beside the stark image of a woman wrapped in a towel , staring into the camera lens .
It has more than 204,000 likes .
Brown said that the woman had broken the hinges off the doors to his house while he was away , presumably in Las Vegas , where he spent his 26th birthday on Tuesday .
In March , Brown was released from felony probation for assaulting his then girlfriend Rihanna in 2009 .
It is unclear how long the woman was in Brownâ€ ™ s home for , though he said that she cooked several meals .
He said she also wrote â€œI love youâ€ � on the walls and wrote her name on his cars .
â€œShe threw out my daughterâ€ ™ s clothing as well as my dogsâ€ ™ stuff , â€ � Brown said .
â€œThen had all these crazy voodoo things around my crib.â€ �

"Maybachs , Bentleys and BMWs might be the four - wheeled vehicles of choice for most hip - hop stars , but now contemporary rappers are ditching walking all together in favour of two - wheeled transport and , in some cases , hoverboards .
On Sunday Wiz Khalifa was arrested after he refused to leave what he claimed was a â€œhoverboardâ€ � while at Los Angeles international airport , joining the long list of hip - hop and R&amp;B artists who have converted to two - wheeled rather than two - legged transport .
Justin Bieber was pictured rolling around on an IO Hawk ( theyâ€ ™ re described as â€œpersonal motorized transportersâ€ � by the company and donâ€ ™ t actually hover , unlike the Hendo hoverboard ) , as were Kylie Jenner , Chris Brown , Souljah Boy and Young Thug .
Rap group Migos were stopped from riding their IO Hawks through a shopping centre when they launched their own clothing line , and Khalifa has used a similar device ( the PhunkeeDuck ) while shopping .
Time magazine named the IO
Hawk one of the coolest pieces of tech from CES 2015 , alongside Mercedesâ€ ™ driverless car .
So why are rappers so attached to these small , seemingly daft devices ?
Retailing at $ 1,799.99 , the IO Hawk is essentially a Segway without a handlebar , with the user controlling motion with his or her body position ( tilting forward to move forward and backwards to slow down ) .
Itâ€ ™ s not surprising that rap stars â€
“ the majority of whom are in their 20s , male and have a huge amount of disposable income and time
â€ “ have found the IO Hawk , hoverboards and PhunkeeDuck appealing .
When I spent time on tour with 2 Chainz he went everywhere on a Segway .
The only time I saw him off it was on stage and when he was sat down .
For the first hour or so it was bizarre to see him float around surrounded by a gaggle of security guards trying to keep up , but after a while it made sense .
Why would you walk when you could roll instead ?
The issue seems to be now that rappers are refusing to leave their devices at all .
After being arrested for not leaving his board , Khalifa tweeted â€œI stand for our generation and our generation is gon na be riding hover
boardsâ€ � , a rallying cry for all millennials with the best part of two grand to chuck about on a glorified scooter that can get you arrested .
Will his arrest be a watershed moment in the â€œroll donâ€ ™ t walkâ€ � revolution ?

"Australian activist group GetUp has called on the immigration minister to bar US musician Chris Brown from entering the country due to his conviction for assault .
GetUp launched an online petition requesting immigration minister Peter Dutton refuse the Grammy - winning singer - songwriter entry when his One Hell of A Nite tour visits Australia in December .
Brown , 26 , was sentenced to five yearsâ€ ™ probation , one year of domestic violence counselling , and 180 days of community labour for assaulting his then - girlfriend Rihanna in 2009 .
Since then , he was implicated in an alleged assault during a basketball game in May , and narrowly escaped a prison sentence over another assault in Washington in 2014 .
Allowing the tour to go ahead would send the implicit message that â€œif you brutally beat a woman , in a short amount of time you will be forgiven , or even celebrated ,
â€ � the GetUp petition states .
â€œChris Brown is an extremely influential figure , particularly among young people .
Allowing his entry into Australia sends the message that the Turnbull government does not place significant weight and condemnation on menâ€ ™ s violence against women.â€ �
The group speculates that Brownâ€ ™ s conviction of felony assault means he is in breach of the Australian visa character test for having â€œa substantial criminal recordâ€ � .
But Brown has already performed to Australian audiences since his conviction , opening his 2011 concert tour F.A.M.E. with shows in Adelaide , Melbourne , Sydney and Brisbane .
Brownâ€ ™ s record label in Australia and Australian immigration has been contacted for comment .
Brown has also announced a concert in New Zealand , where he performed two sold - out shows in 2008 .
New Zealand immigration told the New Zealand Herald while they have not yet received any application from Brown , he would be ineligible to be granted a visa in light of his having been barred from the United Kingdom in 2010 , although exceptions to this rule are sometimes granted .
A poster promoting Brownâ€ ™ s concert bearing the sticker â€œI beat womenâ€

"The new minister for women , Michaelia Cash , has indicated that US singer Chris Brown may not be allowed into Australia due to assault convictions stemming from a domestic violence incident .
In 2009 , Brown pleaded guilty to assault charges after attacking his then girlfriend , pop star Rihanna .
Cash , who was appointed as the minister for women on Monday , intimated that Brown would be denied a visa for an upcoming tour of Australia on character grounds .
â€œI can assure you that the minister for immigration and border protection will be looking at this very , very seriously , â€ � Cash said .
â€œI am clearly not going to pre - empt a decision by the minister , however , I can assure you what my strong recommendation would be.â€ � Cash was in Melbourne with the prime minister , Malcolm Turnbull , heads of the Council of Australian Governments ( Coag ) advisory council , Australian of the year Rosie Batty , and former Victorian police chief Ken Lay , to announce $ 100 m worth of anti - domestic violence measures .
â€œPeople need to understand if you are going to commit domestic violence
and then you want to travel around the world , there are going to be countries that say to you â€˜You
can not come in because you are not of the character we expect in Australia , â€ ™ and certainly , without pre - empting the decision of the minister , I can assure you it is something that the minister is looking at , â€ �
Cash said , referring to the immigration minister , Peter Dutton , who has ultimate say in the decision to deny visas on character grounds .
On Friday , advocacy group GetUp created an online petition calling on Dutton to deny Brown a visa .
By Thursday morning , about 9,700 people had signed it .
â€œIf we stand by and do nothing while he performs around the country
â€
¦ we are implicitly sending the message that if you brutally beat a woman , in a short amount of time you will be forgiven , or even celebrated , â€ � the petition said .
Brownâ€ ™ s planned December tour would take in shows in New Zealand , but his past conviction means he will have to apply for a special visa to get into the country .
Brown , who was sentenced to five yearsâ€ ™ probation for assaulting Rihanna in 2009 , has visited Australia twice since the sentencing , in 2011 and 2012 .
In February , boxer Floyd Mayweather was denied a visa to enter Australia due to his criminal record .
He had been jailed in 2012 for assaulting his ex - partner in front of their children .

Neville Howse , the minister for homes and territories , was asked whether he thought â€œthat in the interests of the white Australia and moral decency , permits to such persons should be refused?â€
� As it happened , he did .
The Colored Idea were bundled out of the country , and it was not until 1954 that another band led by an African American would tour the country .
Itâ€ ™ s worth thinking about that history in the context of suggestions by Michaelia Cash , the new minister for women , that the immigration department should ban Chris Brown from entering Australia .
Thereâ€
™ s no doubt that Brown , convicted of punching and trying to strangle his then girlfriend Rihanna , is a nasty piece of work .
Nor can anyone dispute the seriousness of violence against women in Australia .
According to a much - quoted statistic , a woman is killed roughly once a week by a partner or former partner .
But the immigration department is not the solution .
Quite obviously , the perpetrators of domestic violence in Australia are everyday Australians , not foreign musicians .
Theyâ€ ™ re ordinary people â€ “ husbands , partners , boyfriends .
Theyâ€ ™ re steeped in Australian culture .
Theyâ€ ™ re not brainwashed by American R&amp;B or led astray by song lyrics .
â€œChris Brown is an extremely influential figure , â€ � explains a GetUp petition to the immigration minister , â€œparticularly among young people .
Allowing his entry into Australia sends the message that the Turnbull government does not place significant weight and condemnation on menâ€ ™ s violence against women.â€ �
Itâ€ ™ s difficult to imagine anyone seriously thinks a ban on Brown will diminish whatever influence he wields on young people who , by and large , donâ€ ™
t look to border patrol for affirmation of their musical tastes .
As for â€œsending a messageâ€ � , GetUp puts the situation entirely the wrong way around .
At best , a ban on Brown is a distraction , a cheap headline - grabbing stunt that takes the focus away from the real work â€ “ and the allocation of real resources â€ “ necessary to make women safe .
By emphasising the menace of a foreign entertainer , it obscures the real locus of violence : the nuclear family .
Itâ€ ™ s much easier for politicians to denounce musicians than to acknowledge that most women are hurt or killed within their family , a fundamental social institution .
Furthermore , the exteriorisation of the threat via an immigration ban plays to persistent racial stereotypes about African American men , ideas not so dissimilar to those expressed in the campaign against Sonny Clay and his band .
Everyone knows that rock music is full of misogynists , many of whom have been known to express their sexism in song .
Yet somehow itâ€ ™ s always black artists turned back at the borders .
â€œHe has a whole string of convictions , â€ � said Kevin Andrews back in 2007 , as he explained why Snoop Dogg wouldnâ€ ™ t get a visa .
â€œHe
doesnâ€ ™ t seem the sort of bloke we want in this country.â€ �
Could you imagine a similar conversation about , say , serial drug abuser Keith Richards ?
In 2015 itâ€ ™ s still far more palatable for politicians and moralists to denounce black artists working in black genres than it is to ban musicians who appeal to white baby boomers .
Over the past decade , border policing has become increasingly central to Australian politics .
Think of the publicity the Abbott government gave to its proposal to render terrorism suspects stateless , a concept that appalled civil libertarians .
Think of the asylum seekers held in permanent detention without trial , on the basis of Asio assessments that they can neither see nor challenge .
Think of Scott Parkin , the non - violence activist denied a visa in 2006 on â€ “ wait for it â€ “ character grounds .
Thatâ€ ™ s the context for this debate .
â€œWe urge you to refuse Chris Brown a visa to visit Australia ,
â€ � says GetUpâ€ ™ s petition .
â€œDue to his conviction of felony assault ( a criminal charge ) , we believe he is in breach of the Australian visa character test , for having â€˜a substantial criminal recordâ€ ™ ,â€ �
When a progressive organisation campaigns for the government to apply its â€œcharacter testâ€ � , it legitimises a mechanism that will invariably be used against asylum seekers , immigrants and progressive activists .
Yes , we must end domestic violence .
But thatâ€ ™ s not
â€ “ or shouldnâ€ ™ t
be â€ “ a fight to close the borders .
Itâ€ ™ s a fight to change Australia ."
"The US singer Chris Brown has had his visa application to tour in Australia formally denied on character grounds , the immigration minister , Peter Dutton , has confirmed .
Brown pleaded guilty to attacking his then girlfriend , the pop singer Rihanna , in 2009 .
The performer was issued with a formal notice that his visa application would be denied on Friday night , Dutton said .
He has 28 days to appeal .
â€œPeople to whom these notices are issued have 28 days to present material as to why they should be given a visa to enter Australia , â€ � the minister said .
â€œDecisions on whether a visa will or will not be issued are made after that timeframe and consideration of the material presented to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.â€ �
On Thursday the newly appointed womenâ€ ™ s minister , Michaelia Cash , indicated that Brown would not be let in .
â€œI can assure you that the minister for immigration and border protection will be looking at this very , very seriously , â€ �
she said .
â€œI am clearly not going to pre - empt a decision by the minister , however , I can assure you what my strong recommendation would be.â€ � The immigration minister has ultimate discretion on whether people who have had prior convictions can be granted a visa to enter Australia .
Cash said : â€œPeople need to understand if you are going to commit domestic violence and then you want to travel around the world , there are going to be countries that say to you , â€˜You can not come in because you are not of the character we expect in Australia , â€ ™ and certainly , without pre - empting the decision of the minister , I can assure you it is something that the minister is looking at.â€
� Brown was due to tour Sydney , Melbourne , Brisbane and Perth in December as part of his One Hell of a Nite tour .
Tickets for the shows go on sale on Monday .
A spokeswoman for Brownâ€ ™ s touring company would not answer any of Guardian Australiaâ€ ™ s questions on the matter , offering only :
â€œNo commentâ€ � .
The advocacy group GetUp created an online petition this month calling for Brown to be banned from entering the country , saying that allowing him to tour would send the message that Australia does not take domestic violence seriously .
â€œChris Brown is not the point of this campaign , â€ � a senior campaigner for GetUp , Kelsey Cooke , told Sky News on Sunday .
â€œIt is about domestic violence and taking that seriously , rather than turning a blind eye.â€ �
Cooke said the â€œhigh - profile exampleâ€ � of Brown having his visa denied was a â€œgood sign of the times changingâ€ � .
Brown has toured in Australia twice since his conviction , in 2011 and 2012 ."
"Representatives for Chris Brown remain hopeful the R&amp;B singer will be allowed to tour Australia , despite the immigration minister , Peter Dutton , saying the government intended to deny him a visa .
Dutton on Sunday released a statement saying Brown , who was convicted of a 2009 assault on his then girlfriend , Rihanna , had to prove why he should be allowed into the country .
â€œI can confirm that a notice of intention to consider refusal has been issued , â€ � the statement said .
â€œPeople to whom these notices are issued have 28 days to present material as to why they should be given a visa to enter Australia .
â€œDecisions on whether a visa will or will not be issued are made after that timeframe and consideration of the material presented to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection , â€ �
it said .
Brown was due to visit Sydney , Melbourne , Brisbane and Perth in December as part of the One Hell of a Nite tour .
Tickets for the gigs went on sale on Monday .
His Australian tour representatives , Castor and Ford tours , remained hopeful that the event would go on as planned .
â€œContrary to media reports , Chris Brownâ€ ™ s request to enter Australia on tour has not been denied .
This request is currently being considered by the office of the immigration minister , â€ � a spokeswoman said .
â€œWe respect their right to review this request and have faith that a decision will be made with the full consideration of his continued personal growth , ongoing philanthropic endeavours and desire to perform for his fans , â€ � she said .
â€œSince 2009 , Chris Brown has visited Australia on two separate occasions and is looking forward to returning in December.â€ �
It is unusual for visas to be granted in high - profile cases after a notice of intention has been issued .
The UK has recently denied him a visa , and the government of New Zealand has indicated he will not be allowed there , either .
Brown , who has a string of violent incidents behind him but has managed to avoid jail time , says he has reformed his bad boy ways .
A GetUp petition calling for Brown to be denied a visa in order to send the message that domestic violence will not be tolerated , had more than 14,100 signatures by Monday afternoon .
This story was amended on 29 September to remove a reference to posts on social media attributed to Chris Brown .
The posts were not on his official pages ."
"The American anti - abortion campaigner Troy Newman has been denied a visa to travel to Australia , just days after the government indicated it might block the American singer Chris Brown from touring the country .
Newman was due to speak on the topic â€œsave the babies down underâ€ � at events promoted by the group Right to Life Australia , but was branded an â€œanti - choice extremistâ€ � by the Labor MP Terri Butler , who said Newmanâ€ ™ s visa should be denied on character grounds .
Butler wrote to the immigration minister , Peter Dutton , on Monday arguing that the campaigner could â€œcause significant harm to our communityâ€ � because he had previously called for the execution of abortion doctors .
On Wednesday Dutton said the government was taking action .
â€œI can confirm that my department has cancelled the visa for Mr Troy Newman under Section 128 of the Migration Act , â€ � the minister said .
â€œMr Newman can appeal for a revocation of this decision and no further comment will be made during this appeal
period.â€ �
Newman is president of Operation Rescue , an anti - abortion group that denounced the visa cancellation .
The group blamed â€œviciously false accusations brought by Australian pro - abortion activists and news media that Newman supports violence against abortion providersâ€ � .
â€œNewman has never advocated violence and in fact , urges pro - life activists to work within the governmental and legal system to accomplish change , â€ �
Operation Rescue said in a statement .
â€œNewman boarded his flight in Wichita , Kansas , hoping that the situation would be resolved by the time he arrived in Los Angeles .
However , while boarding a connecting flight in Dehownver , Colorado , Newman was stopped and told he could not board his flight to LA because of an order by the Australian government.â€ �
Newmanâ€ ™ s allies posted footage of the scene at Denver as Newman argued with airport staff who told him he would have to contact the Australian government to contest their refusal to let him on the flight .
Operation Rescueâ€ ™ s senior policy adviser , Cheryl Sullenger , said Newman had been the victim of â€œpolitical persecution , plain and simple , as well as an attempt to silence the pro - life message in Australiaâ€ � .
In the same statement , Right to Life Australia said the group was â€œvery upset that this has happened and are working furiously to turn it aroundâ€
� .
The national president of the organisation , Margaret Tighe , told Guardian Australia that the group has been in touch with Duttonâ€ ™ s office to overturn the decision , which she calls a â€œgross denialâ€
� of Newmanâ€ ™ s rights .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re working as hard as we can to make sure his visa is reinstated , â€ � Tighe said .
â€œThe reason they want to stop him coming is because he had been very effective â€ ¦ the only reason they are doing this is to prevent freedom of speech.â€ �
Butler had focused on comments in the book Their Blood Cries Out , which was co - authored by Newman .
She pointed to this passage : â€œIn addition to our personal guilt in abortion , the United States government has abrogated its responsibility to properly deal with the blood - guilty .
This responsibility rightly involves executing convicted murderers , including abortionists , for their crimes in order to expunge bloodguilt from the land and people.â€ �
On Wednesday Butler welcomed the ministerâ€ ™ s decision to block the visa and rejected claims Newman had been subjected to false accusations .
Butler said her letter to Dutton had quoted Newmanâ€ ™ s own direct comments .
â€œRight to Life should concentrate on making sure there is responsible and respectful debate and not on importing people who advocated for doctors to be executed for doing things that are lawful , â€ � she said .
Laborâ€ ™ s Senate leader , Penny Wong , backed Butlerâ€
™ s request for the visa to be cancelled .
â€œMr
Newmanâ€ ™ s
public comments go well beyond what would be regarded as acceptable debate in this country , â€ �
Wong said .
â€œHis views are repugnant .
Mr Newmanâ€
™ s presence in Australia risks inciting intimidation and violence against vulnerable women.â€
�
The governmentâ€ ™ s decision to cancel Newmanâ€ ™ s visa is a different process from the one adopted in the case of Brown , whose travel was scheduled for December .
Brown was issued with a notice of intention to consider visa refusal , giving the artist 28 days to present material as to why he should be allowed into the country .
Brown pleaded guilty to attacking his then girlfriend , the pop singer Rihanna , in 2009 and was sentenced to five years of probation .
He was due to travel to Australia for shows in Perth , Melbourne , Sydney and Brisbane , but a petition by campaign group GetUp ! to deny him a visa has attracted more than 14,000 signatures .
In a series of comments posted on his official Twitter account on Tuesday , Brown argued that his â€œlife mistakes should be a wake up call for everyoneâ€ � and he should be allowed to proceed with his visit .
â€œI would be more than grateful to come to Australia to raise awareness about domestic violence , â€ � he wrote .
Brown said young people did not listen to parents or public service announcements , but entertainers had the power to change lives .
The minister for women , Michaelia Cash , indicated last week that Brown should not be allowed into Australia .
â€œPeople need to understand if you are going to commit domestic violence
and then you want to travel around the world , there are going to be countries that say to you â€˜You
can not come in because you are not of the character we expect in Australiaâ€ ™ ,â€
�
Cash said at a media event to launch the governmentâ€ ™ s new domestic violence initiatives ."
"Last night , Karrueche Tran hosted an event at Dstrkt London , a club in the West End .
The model , who rose to fame after dating the singer Chris Brown , is of mixed African American and Vietnamese heritage , which means she would probably pass the brown paper bag test .
At the same time , a group of people organised a peaceful protest to take place outside Dstrkt , who have said that they do not have a door policy that discriminates against black people .
Last weekend , Zalika Miller and her friends were turned away from the club despite the fact that their names were on the guest list .
After speaking to the manager , the promoter allegedly sent a message to Millerâ€ ™ s friend to say that the two of them were welcome but the other girls were overweight .
Screenshots of these messages soon surfaced on the internet .
They were accompanied by messages the promoter allegedly sent to another partygoer , where he specifically requests she brings her mixed - race friend .
â€œThe promoter asked for pictures of us before we even got there .
He told my friend Lin , if she was bringing black girls they had to be of a certain calibre , â€ � Miller said .
It is a claim that almost seems ridiculous .
You may think the ladies at the centre of the # DoILookDstrkt hashtag are pulling out the race card , but I can personally testify that something as simple as a night out can be extremely trying for a young black woman .
Unfortunately it is nothing new â€ “ young black ravers have always resorted to tricks in order to gain entry into clubs in central London .
â€œIf itâ€
™ s a guest list event we always change our names , â€ �
Miller tells me .
â€œMy friendâ€ ™ s
last name is Owusu , which is a Ghanaian surname , so we will change it to Smith because they will take one look at the list and know we are black .
They will refuse entry before weâ€ ™ ve even got there .
If youâ€ ™ re refused entry to a club , one trick is to reorganise your party among a group of white women half an hour later .
You are almost guaranteed to walk straight through .
I guess in this case the misconception that all black people look the same plays in our favour .
As Miller shares her story with me , I canâ€ ™ t help but draw similarities between her experience and my own .
The resemblance is uncanny , from the reject wall where she stood with her party while her friend tried to negotiate entry with the promoter , to the journey home , which feels longer than usual .
And itâ€ ™ s not just a central London problem .
A few months ago I was turned away from a club in south London , a venue notoriously known among black , Asian and minority ethnic ravers as racist .
Though they were not as candid about the reason we were not gaining entry , they were happy to let the white women that followed behind me through their doors , as I stared in astonishment across the road .
Many wrongly assume that because there are some minority ethnic people inside partying , a club can not be racist .
It is a reasonable theory on the surface , and I suppose it is easier to believe than to admit that a city which boasts so much diversity â€ “ in London alone we speak more than 300 different languages
â€ “ could be rife with issues that mirror life before the civil rights movement .
Let me assure you that tokenism is a thing .
Unfortunately for me , the club had filled their black quota that night .
Club managers have no problem letting black people in , but only if the ratio is right .
Had I spent less time trying to take the perfect selfie , maybe it would have been someone else standing outside .
Social media has increasingly become an important space for minority ethnic people who want to share their grievances about important issues .
Reporting race - related crimes to the police may result in little to nothing being done , but you can bet that tweeting about it will .
Earlier this year , when a group of students were turned away from a club in Leicester because they were black , they secretly filmed the saga and posted it on YouTube .
The doorman was suspended and the student , Kosi Orah , and his friends were issued an apology .
It is really empowering to see social platforms used in this way , and it is proof that black Twitter is more than â€œan aggressive social media groupâ€ � .
Not only does it raise awareness regarding important issues , but it can get you a quicker turnaround of justice than the police .
Hip - hop nights can not be applauded if they refuse to include those from the culture of which that genre originated .
A night out should not have to be such a painstaking mission of tricks and tactics to make sure you get given entry .
Itâ€ ™ s a shame
that , while genres like bashment are getting more airtime at these clubs , black people who do not look like Karrueche Tran are rarely welcome to join the party ."
"Rick Ross ft Chris Brown â€ “
Sorry You might expect Rick Ross to have slowed down recently .
He had a brush with the law that saw him renege on his own philosophy ( when I interviewed him in 2012 , he said of rapâ€ ™ s relationship with incarceration :
â€œIâ€ ™ m saying being successful is gangsta , being rich is gangsta .
Going to prison isnâ€ ™ t gangstaâ€ � ) .
He has had a busy month : his Black Dollar mixtape came out , with Ross making a typically ostentatious video to go with Geechi Liberace ( fur coats , white mansion , a diamond - encrusted signet ring that spells MOB ) , plus the Money Dance feat The - Dream , Buried in the Streets and an interview with the Breakfast Club .
Rossâ€ ™ s
new album , Black Market , is next and the lead single , Sorry , feat Chris Brown was released this week .
It screams â€œradio trackâ€ � , and is a departure from Rossâ€ ™ s recent penchant for soul - based samples and dusty beats that are more backward - looking than you might expect .
Lyrically , heâ€ ™ s still Ross ( sample lyric : â€œsend the bottles to her table , then make love in a jetâ€ � ) though , and you do wonder whether that shtick will wear thin this time around .
With hip - hop seeming to be in moment of stasis , the bawse will probably be fine .
Mr Muthafuckin eXquire â€ “
Ice Cups A rapper on the other end of the aesthetic spectrum is New York MC Mr Muthafuckin eXquire , who is more into rapping about a night out that ends in pools of vomit and bloody noses than thousand - dollar bar tabs .
On Ice Cups , he channels Raekwonâ€ ™ s gritty yarn - spinning approach and makes it contemporary by taking on gentrification ( â€œI
didnâ€
™ t even know the word until I got some white neighbours
â€ ¦ knock down the chicken spot , turn it into a bike
shopâ€
� ) .
For a subject thatâ€ ™ s been thinkpieced to death , it sounds remarkably fresh coming from eXquire .
Despite being hotly tipped for a couple of years now , he seems more than content to keep ploughing his own furrow regardless of what kind of sound ( trap ) is catnip to labels who might sign him .
Nihilistic , low - slung and idiosyncratic , eXquire is one of hip - hopâ€ ™ s genuine one - offs ( who has been ripped off by bigger artists ) , and his Live Forever EP is out on 8 October .

“
Can I Drake and OVO Sound are using their radio show on Beats 1 to premiere their seemingly endless stream of â€œcontentâ€ � .
The latest comes with added BeyoncÃ © , who doesnâ€ ™ t sing a note and essentially asks one question ( â€œCan I , baby?â€ � ) and says â€œbefore I turn the lights
onâ€
� .
An exercise in hip - hop minimalism ?
Perhaps .
Or a case of fans being hoodwinked into excitement about a â€œcollaborationâ€ � that barely qualifies .
Drake has arguably been the most important rapper of this year .
Battling with Meek Mill , releasing a steady stream of singles and completing a headline tour , unlike Kendrick Lamar whose opus To Pimp a Butterfly was released , impressed a lot of people and then slowly faded from view , Drakeâ€ ™ s been jumping up and down while dishing out tracks for his fans .
Run the Jewels â€
“
Oh My Darling ( Just Blaze remix ) and Rubble Kings Theme Run the Jewels are in a position where they can do whatever they want .
A cat - themed remix album for the hell of it ?
Yep .
A crushing soundtrack for a hip - hop documentary , Rubble Kings , which will probably increase the publicity around said film by 50 % ?
Why not ?
Theyâ€ ™ ve got the Beastie Boysâ€ ™ skill of balancing the absurd with the aurally impressive and even managed to steal the limelight from the supergroup featuring Flying Lotus , Thundercat , Kamasi Washington and George Clinton who guested on the Adult Swim Singles collection that Rubble Kings Theme comes from .
The track below has the duoâ€ ™ s now - to - be - expected muscular production and wordplay that mixes highbrow and lowbrow and treats both impostors the same way .
Boards of Doom â€ “ Deathhop Splicing together two artists for an unofficial release that has the potential to become a huge cult hit isnâ€ ™ t a new concept ( see Danger Mouseâ€ ™ s Grey Album ) .
But this 20-minute mix of Doomâ€ ™ s rap and Boards of Canadaâ€ ™ s ambient trip - hop - tinged productions is a brilliant fit .
Made by Deathhop â€ “ a DJ from north - east England with 50 followers on SoundCloud â€ “ it sees Boards of Canadaâ€ ™ s
Satellite Anthem Icarus melded with My Favourite Ladies by the masked moniker - hoarder .
Odd , and at times a little ill - fitting , it feels just right for these two ."
"Like Nate Dogg , Ashanti , T - Pain , Chris Brown and others previously , Ty Dolla $ ign is rapâ€ ™ s reigning hooksmith , the go - to singer bringing melody to hip - hop tracks .
He also raps , produces and plays instruments .
But heâ€ ™ s best known for his choruses and sung verses , often over beats supplied by fellow a Los Angeles musician : super - producer DJ Mustard .
Together , their minor - keyed , dystopian futurescapes have come to dominate mid - teens hip - hop .
Two weeks from now will see the release of Ty$â€ ™ s debut album , Free TC , on Atlantic .
It will feature all the major - label trimmings , including extensive live instrumentation and collaborations with big - hitters like Kanye West , Fetty Wap , and Kendrick Lamar .
Early tracks like Solid , with Babyface , and Saved , with E-40 , showcase an expansive sonic palette ranging from stripped - down songcraft to first - rate radio fare .
The albumâ€ ™ s title refers to Tyâ€ ™ s younger brother Gabriel â€œTCâ€
�
Griffin , whoâ€ ™ s serving a long bid on a murder conviction .
Ty isnâ€ ™ t very comfortable talking about the case , but says the albumâ€ ™ s proceeds will go towards an appeal .
TCâ€ ™ s plight clearly weighs on him ; as Tyâ€ ™ s star in the industry rises and he acquires the trappings of the good life , heâ€ ™ s unable to enjoy them as he would in an ideal world .
Everyone processes their pain differently , and Tyâ€ ™ s tracks often feel blasÃ
© , to quote the title of a Free TC single , also featuring Future and Rae Sremmurd .
â€œSmoking kush in public , motherfuck the police , I ainâ€ ™ t scared to die , â€ �
he half sings , half raps , adding : â€œStill with the shit , Iâ€

m young and Iâ€ ™ m rich.â€

He says these words almost without emotion , the hip - hop equivalent of a Less Than Zero character :
itâ€ ™ s unclear when the partying stops and the suffering begins .
Or Nah , a huge hit from last yearâ€ ™ s Beach House EP , featuring Wiz Khalifa and DJ Mustard , sounds even more detached .
â€œYou gon na run it for these hundreds girl , or nah?â€ � he begins , propositioning a stripper , before things take a more serious turn .
â€œWould you ride for a nigga , or
nah ?
/
Would you die for a nigga , or nah?â€ �
At their best , Tyâ€ ™ s songs bring to life a character
whoâ€ ™ s drowning in his own hedonism ; at their worst they descend into misogynist clichÃ
© .
Personally , I prefer Ty$ in get - hyped , full - nasty mode , such as on Saved , in which he pledges eternal bachelorhood , and on Up On the Wall , his admonishment against wannabe LA gangstas .
The latter comes from the rapper Gameâ€ ™ s underrated recent album The Documentary 2.5 , the second half of his sequel to his 2005 debut .
Having logged a full decade in the industry , Game has mastered his tone , that of a perpetually plagued street soldier trying to do greater things , narrating his tribulations as they happen in honest - feeling , often self - deprecating detail .
He and Ty$ make for a good pairing , and the latter should take a lesson .
His own songs arenâ€ ™ t yet so mature .
When he talks about his riches and his women he often aims to impress us with just how â€œover itâ€
� he is ; but such posturing tends to grate .
That said , he has just about every musical tool at his disposal .
The son of namesake Tyron Griffin , from venerated funk group Lakeside â€ “ who did the original Fantastic Voyage sampled by Coolio â€ “
he broke out in 2010 on
YGâ€ ™ s
Toot It and Boot It , which he co - wrote , produced and appeared on .
He released a series of well - received mixtapes , and received the shoulder tap of a lifetime when Kanye invited him to Mexico to work on his upcoming album Swish .
Free TC is shaping up as one of the biggest albums of the year , and itâ€ ™ s looking like Ty will be able to write his own ticket for the rest of the decade , or longer .
While in Mexico , Kanye taught Ty â€œto always do me , no matter what anyone saysâ€
�
, Ty told me .
The only issue is that â€œwho he really isâ€ � hasnâ€ ™ t quite yet emerged .
One suspects heâ€ ™ ll make the leap from popular hooksmith to venerated artist when , and only when , he lets his guard down and shows us whatâ€ ™ s inside .
No matter how difficult or painful that might be ."
"Chris Brown has cancelled his tour of Australia and New Zealand seven days before his first show was due to take place .
Ticketek released a statement on Wednesday morning announcing the American singerâ€ ™ s cancellation .
Brown was told by the immigration minister , Peter Dutton , in late September that his visa application would be denied unless he could show cause why it should not be within 28 days .
It is not known whether he did so â€ “ or even if he applied for a visa in the first instance .
A spokeswoman for the Department of Border Control and Immigration said it would not discuss any material provided to the minister by either Brown or his representative for reasons of privacy .
Brown had applied for a work visa to perform in New Zealand last week .
Tickets were still on sale for the Australian leg of the One Hell of a Nite tour , due to start at the Perth Arena on 9 December , as recently as Tuesday .
Brown was also due to perform at Melbourneâ€ ™ s Rod Laver Arena on 12 December , Allphones Arena in Sydney on 14 December and Brisbane Entertainment Centre on 16 December , before a show in Auckland on 18 December .
â€œMr
Brown and the promoters both remain positive that the tour will take place in the near future , â€ � the statement posted to Ticketekâ€ ™ s website said .
â€œMr Brown wishes to express his deepest gratitude to the fans for their support and looks forward to a successful tour in the near future.â€ �
Refunds were offered to those who had bought tickets .
Advance ticket sale numbers for the tour are not known .
The tourâ€ ™ s viability was thrown into doubt in September , when the advocacy group GetUp ! petitioned for Brown to be refused entry to Australia over his conviction for domestic violence .
Brown pleaded guilty to attacking his then - girlfriend Rihanna in 2009 .
But GetUp ! later retracted its campaign after it was criticised for hypocrisy in failing to target other artists convicted of similar offences .
GetUp ! acknowledged it had â€œsupported a racist narrative that sees men of colour unfairly targeted , and stereotyped as more violent than their white counterpartsâ€ � .
In late September Brown tweeted that he would be â€œmore than grateful to come to Australia to raise awareness about domestic violenceâ€ � .
The immigration minister has ultimate discretion on whether people with convictions can be granted a visa .
Brown has toured in Australia twice since his conviction , in 2011 and 2012 .
Ticketek and Brownâ€ ™ s promoter have been contacted for comment ."
"The trailer for Australiaâ€ ™ s second season of Iâ€ ™ m A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here !
features host Chris Brown dressed in a loincloth and co - host Julia Morris in leopard print swinging on a vine through a jungle .
Morris is adorned with what , at best , could be called an African - inspired headdress and jewellery â€ “ the kind of garb you might rent from a dingy Halloween costume shop .
The show is filmed in South Africaâ€ ™ s Kruger national park , but the trailer caption reads more generically â€œdeep in the African jungleâ€ � , a phrase that is constantly repeated in its marketing material .
From fashionâ€ ™ s long - running love affair with blackface to Band Aidâ€ ™ s patronising Christmas song , Africa is too often western pop cultureâ€ ™ s biggest blind spot .
One personâ€ ™ s troppo - safari chic is another personâ€ ™ s grotesque act of cultural appropriation , and a Change.org petition posted on Sunday has called for Channel Ten to retract this â€œoffensive marketing
campaignâ€ � that makes a â€œmockeryâ€ � of Africa .
The petition charges the showâ€ ™ s marketing team of choosing to â€œblatantly misrepresent and make a mockery of the complex , diverse and rich cultures of Africa by reducing it to a misinformed and offensive generalisationâ€
� .
â€œIs this
what we have to accept in 2016 ?
The ignorance and oversimplification of a beautiful multifaceted culture who only seems to be shown in a savage , barbaric light?â€
� wrote a petitioner , Amy Iheakanwa .
At time of writing the petition has ticked over only 500 signatures , but it raises an important issue of where the line is drawn between inspiration and exploitation , or appreciation and appropriation .
Iheakanwa , an Australian of Nigerian descent , told Guardian Australia the trailer left her â€œfumingâ€ � ; she believes it trades on long - held and incorrect views of Africa as â€œfull of savages and barbariansâ€ � with â€œanimals running wild and people dressed half - nakedâ€ � .
As she explained , perpetuating such stereotypes reduces Africa to â€œone country with a jungle running through itâ€ � rather than its reality as a â€œreally multifaceted , amazing continent with so many different cultures , each with its own tradition , tribes and languagesâ€ � .
There are tribes who still dress in traditional ware and are not always fully clothed , she conceded , but the trailer is hardly a respectful homage .
Rather it relies on tired western tropes of Africa and verges on parody .
â€œItâ€ ™ s like weâ€ ™ re still stuck in 1932 , with Tarzan beating on his chest , and Jane .
This doesnâ€ ™ t represent anything thatâ€ ™ s got to do with Africa.â€ �
Iheakanwa suggested promotion of the show should include genuine representations of South Africa , such as iconic landmarks like Table Mountain or Boulders Beach .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re filming in Kruger national park and you didnâ€ ™ t even see the different Zulu , Sotha and Nguni tribes.â€ � Supporter Jeanette Nkrumah wrote in the petitionâ€ ™ s comments there was an â€œonusâ€ � on the media to better inform Australian viewers , and by â€œplaying into trite and offensive stereotypesâ€ �
Channel Ten was perpetuating â€œinsensitive and ignorant pictures of many of the people who live , work in and call this country homeâ€ � .
( The network was contacted and did not provide comment . )
Television is far from the only culprit .
Examples of cultural faux pas are a dime a dozen in fashion and music : from Kylie Jennerâ€ ™
s
cornrows , Rihanna in chola fancy dress , to festival - goers who sport Native American feathered headdresses ( which have now been banned at Montrealâ€ ™ s Osheaga and British Columbiaâ€ ™ s Bass Coast festivals , with restricted sales at Glastonbury ) .
In an October interview , rapper Nicki Minaj reacted to twerk - aholic pop star Miley Cyrus , explaining the importance of listening to the community from which you are borrowing : The fact that you feel upset about me speaking on something that affects black women makes me feel like you have some big balls .
Youâ€ ™ re in videos with black men , and youâ€ ™ re bringing out black women on your stages , but you donâ€ ™ t want to know how black women feel about something thatâ€ ™ s so important ?
Come on , you canâ€
™ t want the good without the bad .
If you want to enjoy our culture and our lifestyle , bond with us , dance with us , have fun with us , twerk with us , rap with us , then you should also want to know what affects us , what is bothering us , what we feel is unfair to us .
You shouldnâ€ ™ t not want to know that .
The appropriation of African culture has particular consequences for Australian audiences , including the 337,823 people in Australia who , according to the 2011 census , were born in an African country .
Sunny - Rue Chivaura , a PhD researcher at Charles Sturt university investigating media representations of Africa in Australia , said Iâ€ ™ m
A Celebrity ...
Get Me Out Of Here!â€
™ s
campaign illustrates an ongoing â€œlack of knowledgeâ€ � around Africaâ€ ™ s diversity and
â€œhow offensive images such as these will impact someone who actually comes from Africaâ€ � .
Chivaura , who was born in Zimbabwe , said it is not uncommon for her to be asked by Australians if she lived in the jungle and if she used to ride elephants to school : â€œThe show just promotes that kind of ignorance.â€
�
The loincloth - meets - leopard - print stereotype taps into â€œcolonial idealism of the â€˜unknown Africaâ€ ™ â€ � , Chivaura said , and â€œexplorer fantasiesâ€ � also associated with other non - European regions such as South America and India .
â€œItâ€
™ s been a few hundred years since the colonial empires were exploring these regions , so why are we still promoting this â€˜idealised savageâ€ ™ version of Africa?â€ �
Chivaura said a comparative lack of African people working in Australian media has led to the perpetuation of these stereotypes .
She watched part of the showâ€ ™ s 2015 debut season and said producers opted for more familiar cultural touch points like cricket and KFC over traditional cuisine , or bringing local personalities on set .
There is a touch of irony in the fact that the long - running UK version of the show is filmed every year in the jungles ( technically , rainforests ) of Springbrook national park , near Murwillumbah , New South Wales .
As Chivaura points out , promotion of the UK show manages to evoke jungle fever without featuring â€œprimitive , semi - naked peopleâ€ � or crass caricatures of Australiaâ€ ™ s Indigenous people .
Flying the Australian cast members all the way to South Africa is a pointless exercise if the producers fall back on tired , retrograde western impressions of the country .
â€œWhy are they even going to Africa if theyâ€ ™ re not going include anything that typifies being in Africa ?
Because that jungle looks no different to the landscapes of far - north Queensland or Fiji.â€ �"
"Jordan Rhodes turned the second half of Blackburn Roversâ€ ™ FA Cup tie at Newport into a showcase for his attacking talents as he hauled his side out of the mire and into a fourth- round trip to Oxford United .
Rovers were in danger of being sunk in this third - round match , postponed from 9 January when the pitch was waterlogged , after Chris Brown was shown a red card in the 10th minute and Newportâ€ ™ s inspirational captain , Mark Byrne , had equalised the visitors opener from a penalty with a magnificent strike on the half - hour .
Newport , ranked 50 places below their Championship opponents , had all the momentum and most of the possession up until the interval when Paul Lambert decided to send on Rhodes .
No sooner had he stepped on to the field than the balance of the game changed .
The question for Blackburnâ€ ™ s manager now is can he keep the Scottish international at the club after January ?
With Championship rivals Middlesbrough and Sheffield Wednesday reputed to be willing to spend more than Â£10 m for Rhodes , the 25-year - old could not have picked a better time to display his striking credentials .
â€œI
havenâ€ ™ t
heard anything about Jordan leaving since Iâ€ ™ ve been here , â€ � said Lambert after the game .
â€œAs far as I am concerned he is our player
and we are delighted with his contribution .
Until a manager picks up the phone and asks the question then
I donâ€ ™ t have a problem but I havenâ€
™ t had any calls at all .
Heâ€
™ s a terrific professional , he gives it everything heâ€
™ s got in all the games and we are delighted with him.â€ �
Rhodes struck in the 75th minute as he ghosted away from his marker in the box to head home a wonderful cross from the left by Tom Lawrence .
It was his 10th goal of the season , and 83rd for the club , and he was delighted to have turned the match around .
â€œItâ€ ™ s great to come to a tough place like this and come away with a win .
It was hard after going ahead and then losing Chris Brown , and then what a goal from their midfielder Mark Byrne , â€ � he said .
â€œBut we said before the match , as long as we work hard , then weâ€ ™ ll be OK .
We scored one more goal than them and thatâ€ ™ s all that matters .
Weâ€ ™ ll take it.â€
�
The treacherous surface seemed tailor made for an upset and County , coming into the game on a high after their first league victory since the end of November at York City two days earlier , gave the big crowd plenty to shout about in the frantic opening exchanges .
Aaron Collins , whose goal had secured the win on Saturday , threatened with his first touch in the Rovers penalty area and there was no sign of nerves from the home players as they attempted to give their new manager , Warren Feeney , another win on his first home game in charge .
But Rovers , who had scored only one goal in their previous six matches , took the lead after eight minutes .
Ben Marshall drew a foul from Scott Barrow after running on to a return ball in the box from Chris Taylor and the referee , Charles Breakspear , had no hesitation in pointing to the penalty spot .
Marshall stepped up and placed the ball beyond the left hand of Joe Day .
If that was the perfect start for Lambertâ€ ™ s side , their joy was brief because Brown raised his studs in a clumsy tackle on the Newport midfielder Medy Elito and was given an instant red card .
It took five minutes to get Elito off the field on the stretcher and he had to have 18 stitches put into a deep gash in his left leg .
County pressed high up the pitch to keep Rovers contained in their own half for long periods and Byrne fired in a fierce half - volley from just outside the box to force a great flying save from Jason Steele .
That may have denied County a quick equaliser but there was no stopping Byrneâ€ ™ s next effort .
Lambertâ€ ™ s response was to turn to Rhodes earlier than expected and almost immediately everything revolved around the substitute .
When Connor Dymond clattered into Tommy Spurr on the right - hand touchline to concede a free - kick , it provided an excellent opportunity to exploit Rhodesâ€ ™ aerial power .
The initial delivery did not find its intended target
but , when Lawrence got a second chance to float the ball into the box , he picked out Rhodes , who headed home .
â€œIâ€
™ m not going to be too hard on the lads because they gave it everything
but we are all a little disappointed
we couldnâ€
™ t keep that momentum going in the second half , â€ � Feeney said .
â€œFor where we are in the league and the small squad weâ€ ™ ve got Iâ€ ™ ve told the lads they can be proud.â€ �"
"Nigeria makes headlines all too often these days â€ “ for the wrong reasons .
Indeed , for the past 18 months whenever I have been outside Nigeria , people always want to know :
â€œWhat happened to those girls?â€ �
They are talking about the 276 girls taken from Chibok government secondary school in April 2014 .
They form part of a total of at least 2,000 women and girls kidnapped between January 2014 and April 2015 , who have sparked protests around the world and the intervention of high - profile figures and celebrities ranging from Michelle Obama to Chris Brown .
But almost two years on the political statements and media reports have yet to translate into meaningful help for the women and girls who come back .
Report after report has documented the brutal realities of their existences under the control of Jamaâ€ ™ at Ahlus - Sunnah Lidaâ€ ™ awati wal - Jihad ( JAS ) , commonly known as Boko Haram : they are forcibly married to fighters and subjected to rape and other sexual violence .
But it is important to not only see the women and girls involved with Boko Haram as victims .
Many try to escape .
Others choose to ferry weapons , indoctrinate and recruit or will take part in attacks .
While the focus on womenâ€ ™ s involvement with Boko Haram has been within the context of abductions , it is important to remember that many women and girls choose to join for reasons ranging from economic to ideological in motive , just as men and boys do .
There is a spectrum between force and choice , victimhood and agency that belies simplistic assumptions based on gender stereotypes .
Not much is known about the situation once the women who were abducted , and their children , are back in their communities .
A report by International Alert and Unicef published today is the first to examine what happens next .
I was part of analysing the key findings with researchers and believe they have much to say about what needs to happen .
In general , survivors of violence usually want and need healthcare , counselling and help reintegrating into their families and communities .
The report found it was no different in Maiduguri .
However , although assistance was reaching survivors , researchers found this was far from adequate given the breadth and depth of the women and girlsâ€ ™ needs and the trauma they had experienced .
It was also uneven .
People spoke of those who arrived at internally displaced camps first or were in older camps having better access and quality of services and goods .
Women and girls living in host communities reported not receiving any services at all .
Importantly , abortion is only permitted to save the life of the mother , leaving women and girls who have become pregnant with few choices .
Although a majority of women interviewed wanted to continue their pregnancy , not all were willing or able to care for the children while some had tried to abort the pregnancy using local methods .
These women and girls are stigmatised and feared by many .
Referred to as â€œBoko Haram wivesâ€ � or annoba ( epidemics ) , people are afraid they have been indoctrinated â€ “ and will spread these views .
Some husbands divorced wives on their return .
Given the lack of economic opportunities , this leaves them facing destitution .
The children they have given birth to , whose biological fathers are Boko Haram fighters , are also viewed with fear and suspicion .
They are considered â€œhyenas among dogsâ€ � , to have bad blood and are assumed likely to be the next generation of fighters .
After all , â€œa child of a snake is a snakeâ€ � .
As a result , children , including babies , and their mothers are being ostracised and left at risk of further violence .
However , many family members have shown acceptance .
Much depends on whether the woman or girl left willingly or was abducted , how long they had been married to their husbands and whether they had children together .
Many cited Quâ€ ™ ranic verses that men should take back their wives if they are in captivity for less than five and a half years and accept any child born as their own .
Most people viewed the women and girls as victims â€ “ but felt they needed to go through a deradicalisation and rehabilitation programme before reintegrating back into the community .
It is easy to know what to think about â€œinnocentâ€ � women and girls who are abducted and in captivity .
There is less certainty when they return when there has been some element of choice or when they have played some part in attacks .
Community reactions are understandable if women and girls have played active roles and given the trauma communities themselves have experienced .
These fears have been exacerbated by stories circulating of women and girls returned from captivity murdering their parents .
Understanding and nuance is needed in response .
The concerns of communities need to be addressed , but the solution is not to view all women and girls with suspicion , stigmatise and marginalise them further and infringe on their human rights .
They need high - quality , long - term , ongoing care as well as conscious efforts to address and respond to community fears .
The current insufficient and partial nature of services available needs to be redressed .
This includes the right to choose whether to continue pregnancies .
At minimum , alternative care systems for children that are monitored and regulated should be established .
Concerted efforts are needed to address the biological determinism that affects how these children are viewed , not just now but at various stages over the next few decades as they grow up .
So far , the scale of needs has outstripped response .
If urgent action is not taken then this trend is only set to increase as more women and girls return .
In 2014 , abductions in Nigeria captured the attention of the worldâ€ ™ s media , politicians and public .
Itâ€ ™ s now time to translate some of that into meaningful and long - term support for the women and girls â€ “ and their children â€ “ who have come back ."
"Best Coast singer Bethany Cosentino has criticised singer Chris Brown for â€œperpetuating rape cultureâ€ � with his recent single Back to Sleep .
Cosentino objected to the lyrics of the track , which is also known as Fuck You Back to Sleep and contains lines such as â€œJust let me rock , fuck you back to sleep girl / Donâ€ ™ t say a word no , girl donâ€ ™ t you talk /
Just hold on tight to me girl
/ Fuck you back to sleep girl , and rock you back.â€
�
The track reached the US Billboard top 20 in March .
The Best Coast star tweeted : â€œYou already know how I feel about Chris Brown â€
“ but
WHY / HOW are those lyrics OK ?
Cool , a song that perpetuates rape culture being a hit.â€
�
She also took aim at the industry , criticising the A&amp;R team who approved the song and publications such as Billboard who gave the track a glowing review .
Responding to criticism of her position , Cosentino wrote : â€œ4 those of you that donâ€ ™ t understand the definition of â€œconsensual sexâ€ � â€ “ itâ€ ™ s not TELLING a woman yr gon na wake her up 2 fuck her .

Brown has been no stranger to controversy since , in 2009 , he pleaded guilty to a felony assault on his then - girlfriend Rihanna .
Chris Brown or his representatives are yet to respond to Beth Cosentinoâ€

"Bill Shorten has said he accepts a recommendation to dump Laborâ€ ™ s candidate for Fremantle , unionist Chris Brown , because he was â€œnot forthcoming with the truthâ€ � about prior convictions .
According to the West Australian , Brown failed to disclose convictions from the 1980s , including pleading guilty to assaulting a police officer during an altercation and drink - driving .
The assault conviction was later expunged but Brown received a 12-month good behaviour bond , it said .
Guardian Australia has confirmed Labor will disendorse Brown .
On Thursday , Brown said he had been charged with assault but not assault of a police officer .
He said he had been king - hit at a festival in Clermont .
â€œI was the victim in the incident and fortunately there was a police officer that had contact made with him , â€ � he said .
Brown also claimed â€œthe only reason the ALP is aware of is is because Iâ€ ™ ve been open and honourable about this processâ€ � .
But Shorten said : â€œIt is on clear that serious matters the candidate wasnâ€ ™ t forthcoming with the truth to the Labor Party.â€
�
Shorten said he â€œagreed 100%â€ � with the national secretaryâ€ ™
s recommendation to dump Brown as the candidate .
Brown is a freight and logistics worker who has spent the past 12 months as a campaign coordinator for the Maritime Union of Australia .
He won the preselection battle for Fremantle , beating Josh Wilson , a former staffer for the current Fremantle MP , Melissa Parke .
Wilson , who is Fremantleâ€ ™ s deputy mayor , beat Brown in a local ballot in March but the MUA candidate won endorsement at the ALP state council .
Shorten said the party would make a decision on disendorsement today .
â€œThey will do so and I believe that Josh Wilson , the deputy mayor of Fremantle , will be a very good candidate in Fremantle , â€ � he said .
Fremantle is held by Labor on a 4.8 % margin .
Is is one of just three seats Labor holds in Western Australia , compared with the Coalitionâ€ ™ s 12 .
It is being targeted by the Greens , whose candidate , Kate Davis , was a lawyer for the UN and an outspoken critic of Laborâ€ ™ s support of the offshore detention model .
Brownâ€ ™ s preselection had been a cause for some consternation for some Labor members , who felt he was an unnatural successor to Parke , a former human rights lawyer .
Davis has attempted to exploit the view she is Parkeâ€ ™ s more natural successor .
â€œI think Melissa Parke is known in the electorate for her advocacy in relation to human rights , particularly with regard to refugees , â€ �
she told Guardian Australia for an earlier feature on the electoral contest .
â€œHer justified anger was outspoken regardless of whether that was in contravention of Labor party policy .
I think people saw her as an advocate with integrity.â€ �
On Monday , Brown brushed aside concerns about his preselection .
Brown said he believed he was fit to represent Fremantle because he had a â€œvery good understandingâ€ � of the suburb , where his family first settled in 1851 .
â€œI am not someone who has come in from outside , â€ � he said .
Brown was contacted for further comment about the disendorsement .
After discovering news of the disendorsement , Davis said : â€œIt doesnâ€ ™ t matter who the Labor party chooses as its candidate in Fremantle , that candidate is still bound by the partyâ€ ™ s policies , including offshore detention of asylum seekers and a weak climate policy.â€ �"
"Sherry Sufi has resigned as Liberal candidate for the West Australian seat of Fremantle to stop his controversial comments from the past causing â€œfurther distraction from the good work being done by the prime ministerâ€ � .
A week ago , Chris Brown , the former Labor candidate , was disendorsed after it was revealed he had failed to disclose criminal convictions from the 1980s .
Brown was swiftly replaced by Josh Wilson , an aide to the outgoing Labor MP Melissa Parke .
Sufi , 33 , was absent from Malcolm Turnbullâ€ ™ s flying visit to Perth on Monday , after reports he had misdescribed his work history on his application for preselection , warned that same - sex marriage could lead to polygamy , said the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people could lead to division , and criticised the 2008 apology to the stolen generations .
Turnbull had waved aside questions about Sufiâ€ ™ s absence at his Perth news conference , saying he hoped he was â€œdoing a good door - knockingâ€ � in Fremantle , which he said was â€œvery character - buildingâ€ � .
He had also distanced himself from Sufiâ€ ™ s comments .
In a statement released on Friday , Sufi said he had resigned as a candidate and also from his position as head of the Liberal party of WAâ€ ™ s policy committee .
â€œI am doing this in light of continued focus on events from my history , â€ � he said .
â€œI apologise if my words and actions have caused offence to anyone .
This was never my intent .
â€œI am disappointed that I will not be seeing this campaign through , but I am putting the interests of the Liberal party first .
I want to avoid further distraction from the good work being done by the prime minister and his Liberal team.â€ �
It is believed a 2013 incident , in which he was reported to have been caught on camera mocking the South African accent of the Liberal state MP and his then boss Michael Sutherland , might have contributed to Sufiâ€ ™ s resignation .
The details of his actions were reported in the Fremantle Herald on Friday .
A replacement candidate has not been announced , but Pierrette Kelly , an aide to the WA Liberal senator Chris Back , had received the second - highest number of votes in preselection .
The Liberal party has taken a hammering in Fremantle â€ “ held by Labor on a margin of 4.8 % â€ “ because of its handling of the proposed Perth Freight Link , the final route of which is yet to be resolved .
It is Laborâ€ ™ s safest seat in WA but is under threat from the Greens .
The Greens candidate Kate Davis , who took a sabbatical from her role as head of Tenancy WA to campaign , told Guardian Australia on the first day of the campaign that the electorate was looking for â€œan advocate with integrityâ€ � .
Davis is now the only original candidate of the three major parties still standing .
The Labor candidate for the seat of Moore , David Leith , also resigned this week over a 2015 Facebook post referring to Australiaâ€ ™ s offshore immigration detention camps as â€œgulagsâ€ � .
The post said refugees were held in detention for â€œessentially political reasonsâ€ � , meaning Australia was â€œpossibly the only state to hold civilians , including children , as political hostagesâ€ � .
Moore , which covers Perthâ€ ™ s outer northern suburbs , is held by the Liberal MP Ian Goodenough on a margin of 11.8 % ."
"The cobbled streets of old Baku , the capital of Azerbaijan , have been tarmacked in preparation for the European Grand Prix , the latest ploy the countryâ€ ™ s rulers hope will distract from their corruption .
As symbolism goes , the Formula One race through Baku is pretty blunt : the Aliyevs , made rich from oil and gas , flatten the city in preparation for an influx of petrolheads and celebrities , including Pharrell Williams , Enrique Iglesias and Chris Brown , who will sing for the race crowds .
The Sport for Rights campaign , of which I am a member , believes superstars such as Lewis Hamilton and Williams should speak out , not be complicit in the propaganda that attempts to gloss over human - rights abuses .
In spite of the recent release of renowned journalist Khadija Ismayilova , Azerbaijanâ€ ™ s prisons are populated by dissenters and activists , awkward - shaped cobbles that could upset the smooth running of the autocratsâ€ ™ propaganda machine .
Opposition politician Ilgar Mammadov has been in jail for more than three years , imprisoned because President Aliyev saw him as a political threat .
Mammadov had the temerity to want to stand against Aliyev in 2013â€ ™ s presidential election .
He found himself convicted on a ludicrous charge of inciting riots .
The Council of Europe has demanded that Azerbaijan comply with the European Court of Human Rights judgment in Mammadovâ€ ™ s case by releasing him immediately .
Youth activist Ilkin Rustemzade has also been jailed for more than three years , in connection with a series of pro - democracy protests held in 2013 .
Journalist Seymur Hezi has been in prison for a year and a half , on the old Soviet catch - all charge of â€œhooliganismâ€ � .
The list goes on .
Meanwhile , criminal investigations have been launched against Meydan TV , which provides rare critical news coverage of Azerbaijan , with 15 journalists specifically named .
No one believes the case is anything but political .
In the past year , the manat , the local currency , has been devalued twice .
As oil and gas prices collapse worldwide , Azerbaijanis find themselves twice as poor as they were .
Protests have erupted across 12 regions in the country .
People struggle to keep up with repayments to the bank , or even to eat .
No matter : on to the next spectacle .
After the abysmal failure of the inaugural European Games held in Baku in 2015 ( so poorly received that not a single country has stepped forward to host the next tournament ) , Ilham Aliyev continues his attempts to â€œsportswashâ€ � his corruption , most recently revealed in the Panama papers , with a grand prix .
It was as a response to this â€œsportswashingâ€ � tactic that we Azerbaijani human - rights defenders set up the Sport for Rights campaign .
If Aliyev wants to use international sporting events to polish his image , then weâ€ ™ ll use the same events to draw attention to the many who are jailed for speaking out .
Just last month , two young activists found themselves imprisoned on absurd charges .
On 10 May , Bayram Mammadov and Giyas Ibrahim were arrested after they decided to mark Flowers Day , a national celebration , by graffiting a statue of former president Heydar Aliyev , Ilhamâ€ ™ s father , with the words â€œFuck the systemâ€ � and
â€œHappy Slave Day!â€ � .
( A pun .
In Azeri , â€œgulâ€ � means â€œflowerâ€ � ,
â€œqulâ€ � means â€œslaveâ€ � ) .
As so often happens with Azerbaijani activists , they were arrested not for their dissent , but on fake criminal charges , in this case drug possession .
Laughably , the authorities claimed that a search of their homes revealed two kilograms of heroin .
In custody , the two were whipped on the soles of their feet and tortured â€œSaddam Hussein styleâ€ � , as one fellow activist put it .
Their injuries were confirmed by the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention .
Mammadov and Ibrahim will , of course , be locked up for the duration of the grand prix .
But even in prison , they , and dozens like them , will appreciate the irony after the race , when Pharrell Williams takes the stage to sing his hit Freedom : â€œWho cares what they see ?
Who cares what they know?â€
�
Indeed .
And who cares for the Azerbaijanis languishing in prison for daring to sing for democracy ?

"Kanye Westâ€ ™ s art world aspirations are not new but his execution of them â€ “ as evidenced by the new video to his song Famous â€ “ are becoming more sophisticated .
Based on a 2008 work by American realist painter Vincent Desiderio , the video features the rapper and wife Kim Kardashian lying naked on an extremely wide bed in a sweaty , post - coital sleep .
They are in the middle of 10 more nude celebrities â€ “ Taylor Swift ( who is dissed in the lyrics ) , Rihanna , Chris Brown , Ray J , Westâ€ ™ s former girlfriend Amber Rose , his in - law Caitlyn Jenner , Donald Trump , Bill Cosby , George W Bush and Anna Wintour .
Some , or perhaps all , are waxworks â€
“
the camera passes across their bodies , the quality of the film grainy , the soundtrack culminating in two minutes of cheering and heavy breathing .
Whether Famous makes West an artist is as contentious as whether making a line of clothes means he should be regarded as a fashion designer .
West has claimed that as well as Desiderio , the video was inspired by Matthew Barney â€
“ â€œmy
Jesusâ€ � .
Barney is renowned for his sprawling , mythology - packed films , which also often make use of famous people â€ “ though those are willing participants , unlike the ones in depicted in Famous .
Two years ago , West attended the New York premiere of Barneyâ€ ™ s six - hour River of Fundament , a work inspired by Norman Mailerâ€ ™ s Ancient Evenings , and which includes several controversial set pieces , including the insertion of an eye into the anus of a pregnant woman .
Famous does not include anything so transgressive , but its depiction of women like Swift naked , presumably without their consent ( West defied them to sue , in a now - deleted tweet ) , has caused disquiet , though West claims that he took any overtly sexual shots out of the video .
Unconvinced , Lena Dunham said the video brought to mind Stanford University rapist Brock Turner , writing : â€œNow I have to see the prone , unconscious , waxy bodies of famous women , twisted like theyâ€ ™ ve been drugged and chucked aside at a rager ? ...
Seeing a woman I love like Taylor Swift ( f--- that one hurt to look at , I couldnâ€ ™ t look ) , a woman I admire like Rihanna or Anna , reduced to a pair of waxy breasts made by some special effects guy in the Valley , it makes me feel sad and unsafe and worried.â€
�
A curator with a New York gallery , who contacted the Guardian and was reluctant to be named , agrees with Dunham .
â€œKanye is using the body of Taylor Swift without asking her and putting her in this submissive position .
Sure , heâ€ ™ s making a comment on television culture and appropriation , and heâ€ ™ s calling it art , but I donâ€
™ t know if you can call something art just because it stirs up controversy.â€ �
Whether or not it works as art , Famous has reinforced Westâ€ ™ s reputation as a skillful appropriator with a flare for controversy .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a comment on fame , â€ �
he told Vanity Fair .
He also claimed his life is â€œwalking performance artâ€ � .
Desiderio , the artist who inspired the video , gave the video his seal of approval .
He told W magazine after being invited to see the video at its premiere in Los Angeles , that what Famous â€œdemonstrated was the power of the artistic imagination to transcend categorical expectationsâ€ � .
While that clears the threshold of certain kind of artistic criticism , Desiderio went further , offering that the video demonstrates â€œthe fluidity of the transfer of codes deeply embedded within the apparatus of our preferred mediumsâ€ � .
Meanwhile , cultural commentator Bob Lefsetz wrote over the weekend that Famous , â€œcut from the same cloth as Madonnaâ€ ™ s Sex bookâ€
� , just proves that video is bigger than ever .
â€œThatâ€
™ s the appeal , itâ€ ™ ll bring so many looky - loos , but in this case you donâ€ ™ t have to buy it to see it , thatâ€ ™ s so last century , itâ€ ™ s free for the taking on the internet .
Because in todayâ€ ™ s world you donâ€
™ t charge for everything , you garner your audience and monetize later , like the tech companies.â€
�
But does that make it art ?
â€œThis is a stunt .
We wonâ€ ™ t be talking about it next month , if weâ€ ™ re even discussing it next week .
But thatâ€ ™ s OK , Kanye will come up with something else.â€ �
As for content , Lefsetz adds , â€œwhen you marry boobies and fame youâ€ ™ ve hit the jackpot .
All but the asexual want to see this clip at least onceâ€ � .
The last time a pop star of similar standing , Jay Z , aspired to create a performance art piece it ended in acrimony .
In 2013 , the rapper performed at New York Cityâ€ ™ s Pace gallery with artist Marina AbramoviÄ‡ , playing his song Picasso Baby for six continuous hours .
Years later , AbramoviÄ‡ claimed the rapper didnâ€ ™ t live up to promises that were made in exchange for her involvement and said participants were â€œtotally usedâ€ � , and â€œcame out with nothingâ€ � .
She also described it as a one - way transaction .
The Marina AbramoviÄ‡ Institute later issued an apology to Jay Z. A curator involved with the Picasso Baby performance told the Guardian that Kanye and Jay Zâ€ ™ s art - music pieces have little in common .
â€œDoing things just for the sake of shocking people doesnâ€ ™ t make it art .
Heâ€
™ s trying very hard to create a controversy so people will talk about it.â€ �
Or perhaps as West and Jay Z put it in their own single , Niggas in Paris , using a sample from Will Farrellâ€ ™ s Blades of Glory :
â€œI donâ€ ™ t even know what that means .
No one knows what it means , but itâ€ ™ s provocative .
No itâ€ ™ s not , itâ€ ™ s gross .
Gets the people going.â€ �"
"The R&amp;B singer Chris Brown was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon following an hours - long standoff on Tuesday at his Los Angeles home , police said .
Police had been called to Brownâ€ ™ s home at 3 am local time on Tuesday morning after a woman called police for assistance .
The woman told the Los Angeles Times that Brown had pointed a gun at her before she ran away , and that later one of his associates asked her to sign a nondisclosure agreement .
Baylee Curran told the newspaper that she and two acquaintances were at Brownâ€ ™ s home to discuss future projects .
A man Curran did not know was showcasing jewelry in the home , and Curran said the conflict started when she stopped to look at the jewelry .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know if it was Chrisâ€ ™ friend or how he was related , but thatâ€ ™ s when he told me to back away from the diamond necklace and started cussing me out and calling me names , â€ � she told the Times .
â€œThatâ€
™ s when Chris pulled his gun and told me to â€˜Get out , â€ ™ he said .
â€˜Iâ€ ™ m sick of you girls , get the â€ ¦ out!â€ ™ â€ � Curran and a friend ran from the home and waited by the propertyâ€ ™ s gate while an associate of Brownâ€ ™ s retrieved her phone , she said .
The associate reportedly said heâ€ ™ d only give her the phone if she agreed to sign a nondisclosure agreement .
Curran said she refused , grabbed her phone and ran to a neighborâ€ ™ s property while the man gave chase .
The neighbor called police , according to the Los Angeles Times .
A search warrant was served on the property just before 1 pm on Tuesday , nearly nine hours after the 911 call was made .
Throughout the hours - long standoff , Brown posted online videos declaring his innocence .
In one Instagram video Brown , waving a cigarette and looking at the camera , said if and when police obtained the search warrant , they would find nothing at the home .
He dismissed TV reports that he was barricaded inside .
According to the celebrity news site TMZ , police retrieved a duffel bag Brown threw out of the window of his home .
Brown was released on $ 250,000 bail and is scheduled to appear in court on 20 September , according to jail records .
He awaits formal charges and will be arraigned in September , the Los Angeles Times reported .
Calls to representatives for Brown were not immediately returned on Tuesday .
Brown has denied any wrongdoing through his longtime attorney Mark Geragos , who wrote on Twitter that the accusations against Brown were â€œdemonstrably falseâ€ � .
The Grammy - winning singer has had multiple run - ins with law enforcement .
He spent six years on probation after pleading guilty to attacking his girlfriend at the time , Rihanna , in 2009 ."
"What started as an Instagram row has escalated to such an extent that the greatest pound - for - pound boxer of his generation has become involved in the beef between R&amp;B stars Chris Brown and Soulja Boy .
Floyd Mayweather , who was undefeated in his 49 fights , winning world titles at super featherweight , lightweight , light welterweight , welterweight and light middleweight , is to train Soulja Boy for a three - round bout with Brown , to take place in Las Vegas in March .
The dispute began on Tuesday , when Brown took exception to Soulja Boy liking an Instagram photo posted by Brownâ€ ™ s former girlfriend , Karrueche Tran .
The two stars began posting threatening Instagram videos directed at each other , as well as mocking tweets .
Soon , Brown challenged Soulja Boy to a fight , and his offer was accepted .
Though Soulja Boy posted a remorseful video in which he said he hoped to work with Brown , he also tweeted a message involving Brownâ€ ™ s infant daughter , to which Brown responded furiously in a video , saying : â€œWe gon na set up this fight , itâ€ ™ s gon na be professional , you can do all of that .
But one thing you got ta stop doing my nigga , Iâ€ ™ m gon na be real with you : stop bringing my daughter into this my nigga .
Stop saying shit about my fucking daughter.â€ �
The fight became a reality on Thursday , when Mayweather â€ “ who is now a boxing promoter
â€ “ posted an image on his Instagram plugging the fight as â€œMayweather Promotions Presents â€ ¦ celebrity boxing live on pay - per - viewâ€ � .
Soulja Boy reposted the image , adding : â€œSigned my contract Iâ€ ™ m leaving the fight with $ 1,000,000 I got the best ever my big bro @floydmayweather training me damn â€ ¦ March in Vegas ! !
On TV.â€ �
He followed that with a video of him and Mayweather , with the former boxer saying , â€œWe got ta get the moneyâ€ � and Soulja Boy responding : â€œThe biggest fight of the century.â€ �"
"As if the prospect of Soulja Boy fighting Chris Brown on pay - per - view television were not enough , Meek Mill has now suggested he and Drake should join the ranks of R&amp;B stars and rappers settling their beefs in the boxing ring .
During a livestream , the rapper said : â€œIâ€ ™ d beat Drizzy the fuck up for five mil .
Of course I would .
We gon na let Nicki [ Minaj ] be the ring girl .
Yâ€ ™ all would come to see that fight , wouldnâ€ ™ t yâ€ ™ all ?
Yâ€ ™ allâ€ ™
d spend $ 100 a ticket for that.â€ �
The bad blood between the pair stems from July 2015 , when Meek Mill suggested Drake used ghostwriters , notably on the track R.I.C.O. , a collaboration between the pair .
Drake responded with two diss tracks aimed at his rival .
The feud rumbled on , with producer Quentin Miller claiming he was attacked by Mill and his associates after denying he had ghostwritten for Drake , an allegation denied by Mill .
However , any fight is unlikely to happen .
For one thing , Drake would be crazy to accept the challenge .
Mill is 6ft2ins , while Drake is 5ft11 in , suggesting the former would have a significant advantage in weight and reach .
As the boxing adage goes : a good big â€ ™ un will always beat a good little â€ ™ un .
More to the point , as Soulja Boy and Chris Brown look likely to find out , it may simply be logistically impossible to stage such a fight .
As the New York Post points out of the Boy - Brown bout , plans to host the showdown in Las Vegas would almost certainly be scuppered by the regulations insisted upon by the Nevada Boxing Board of Control .
Even suggestions to move the fight to Dubai , or elsewhere in the United Arab Emirates , seem unlikely to help it come to pass .
â€œThe Money Teamâ€ ™ s
[ Mayweather Promotions ] accountants will realise that this is an event that no one â€ “ including their fans â€ “ will pay to watch on PPV , and that itâ€ ™ s just a money - losing proposition ,
â€ �
Jim Murphy of sportsbettingexperts.com told the Post .
â€œDonâ€
™ t be surprised if talk of this fight quietly disappears over the next few weeks .
Itâ€ ™ s significantly more likely that the principals will record an album or go on tour together than it is theyâ€ ™ ll ever meet in a boxing ring.â€ �"

"Governments must stop exporting so much plastic waste to countries such as China and keep more in - country to be recycled into bottles to tackle the waste crisis , industry insiders say .
A day after the Guardian revealed that a million plastic bottles are bought every minute across the world , experts aiming to provide a closed loop in which each bottle is used to make a new one , say their industry faces multiple hurdles .
Chris Brown of Clean Tech , based in Lincolnshire â€ “ the only site in the UK which produces food grade recycled polyethylene terephthalate ( Pet ) from plastic bottles to turn them into new bottles
â€ “ said : â€œIt has been
a very challenging environment.â€ �
â€œThe recycling of Pet back into rPet ( recycled plastic ) is a relatively new industry and it has proven very difficult for any businesses to survive in recycled plastics .
The margins are such that they struggle to be successful , particularly when the processes require large capital investment and present a significant technological challenge.â€ �
He called for the UK government to end the incentives for export of post consumer plastic to China and other countries â€ “ more than two - thirds of plastic collected for recycling in the UK was sold abroad in 2016 , where it may be incinerated or buried rather than recycled according to industry experts quoted by Greenpeace .
â€œBeing able to keep more of that material in this country would be better for the bottle manufacturers and their customers , â€ �
he said .
â€œIt is important that the feedstock is available for rPet producers , so what we would like to see is an end to the incentivising of its export .
Having an incentive to export the bales instead of keeping them in the country to be used to make more plastic bottles does not seem like what we should be doing at the moment.â€ � Clean Tech buys bales of post consumer plastic ( Pet ) bottles that have been collected in kerbside recycling .
At its site in Lincolnshire , Clean Tech granulises the bales , sorts out the Pet from other plastic which might have contaminated the bale , turns it into new plastic pellets of recycled Pet and puts it through a process to make it safe to be used for drinks .
Bales are then sold to companies â€ “ including Coca - Cola â€ “ who use it to make new bottles .
Its parent company , Plastipak is the biggest producer of recycled plastic for bottles in Europe .
A spokesperson for Plastipak said its three plants in Europe â€ “ in the UK , in Bearne in France and in Luxemburg â€ “ faced challenges .
Urgent reform was needed to keep the recycled plastic bales in - country , the spokesperson said .
â€œThis should be a growth industry .
Everyone wants to recycle and everyone , in theory , wants to include recycled material in products .
But this is a process that costs money , it is a commercial venture and one of the big hindrances is the cost of virgin material has been lower than the cost of recycled plastic partly because of the low oil price ,
â€ � they said .
In the UK particularly there is a shortage of post consumer plastic to turn into recycled plastic for bottles because the collection systems are so poor .
But the lack of stocks for creating recycled plastic is a global problem .
â€œThere is also competition for this stock â€ “ it is used for other things like the plastic tape around packages , â€ � said the spokesperson .
Industry experts say the UK should follow the example of countries that impose a deposit return scheme on plastic bottles , which encourages higher recycling rates .
Caroline Lucas , the UK Green MP said Guardian figures which show by 2021 more than half a trillion plastic bottles will be bought across the globe , were shocking .
â€œGlobal plastic bottle use is spiralling out of control .
The environmental consequences of a million plastic bottles being used every minute are absolutely devastating , â€ � said Lucas .
â€œAs consumers we can all make choices which limit our plastic bottle use , but the key to solving this crisis is action from governments .
Thatâ€ ™ s why Iâ€ ™ m calling for a bottle deposit scheme to be implemented urgently .
Currently Britain uses 38.5 m plastic bottles every day â€ “ and we should be leading the world in reusing bottles and rapidly reducing our plastic waste.â€ �
Greenpeace is pressing for the major brands to do more to increase the recycled content of their bottles .
The top six drinks companies in the world use a combined average of just 6.6 % of recycled Pet in their products , according to Greenpeace .
Many believe Coca - Cola and other brands are not ready to increase the amount of recycled plastic because it would compromise the appearance of their bottles .
Across the UK
Coca - Cola says it uses 25 % of recycled plastic in its bottles .
It aims to increase this to 40 % by 2020 .
But Coca - Cola said the 40 % target would stretch with the current volumes of recycled plastic of the right quality available .
â€œCoca - Cola buys approximately 20 % of the global food grade rPet supply available in the marketplace ,
â€ � the company said .
â€œWe continue to increase the use of recycled plastic in countries where it is feasible and permitted.â€ � â€¢ This article was amended on 30 June to add a link to a Greenpeace article in which industry experts said waste may be incinerated or buried rather than recycled .
The subheading has also been amended ."
"R&amp;B star Chris Brown has talked about his past abuse of ex - girlfriend Rihanna , who was left bruised and bleeding after Brown attacked her in February 2009 .
Brown was arrested following the incident , and was sentenced to community service and domestic violence counselling , plus a restraining order .
In a new film documentary , Chris Brown :
Welcome to My Life , he goes into detail about the abusive relationship , saying he â€œfelt like a fucking monsterâ€ � .
He said that he had intended to marry Rihanna , but that he lost her trust after he lied about a sexual encounter with someone who worked with him , that happened prior to their relationship .
â€œShe hated me after that .
I tried everything , she didnâ€ ™ t care .
She just didnâ€ ™ t trust me after that , â€ � he said .
â€œFrom there , it just went downhill because there were too many verbal fights , physical fights as well .
Mutual sides ...
We would fight each other .
She would hit me , I would hit her and it never was OK .
â€œThere was always a point
where weâ€ ™ d talk about it like , â€˜What the fuck are we doing?â€ ™ â€ � he continued .
â€œLike , â€˜I donâ€ ™ t like you slapping me.â€
™
If I go on stage I got a scratch on my face
and I got ta explain it like , â€˜Oh , no
I fell.â€ ™
If you got a scar or a bruise you got ta put makeup on .
Iâ€ ™ m not ever trying to put my hands on any female.â€ �
Discussing the specific incident he was arrested over , he said it came about after Rihanna became suspicious of texts he had received from another woman .
â€œSheâ€ ™ s fighting me , and Iâ€ ™ m like : Iâ€ ™ m telling you the truth , I swear to God , stop it .
She hits me a couple more times , and it doesnâ€ ™ t go from translation : sit down , Iâ€ ™ m trying to tell you the truth .
It goes to : now Iâ€ ™ m finna be me , and be evil ...
She tried to kick me ... and I really hit her , with a closed fist , I punched her .
When I saw it , I was in shock , I was like , fuck , why did I hit her .
She spit blood in my face â€ “ and it raised me even more ...
She grabbed my nuts , and I bit her arm.â€ � Referring to the picture of her injuries that circulated the media afterwards , he said : â€œI look back at that picture and Iâ€ ™ m just like : thatâ€ ™ s not me .
I hate it to this day â€ “
thatâ€ ™ s going to haunt me forever.â€ �
In a 2009 interview following the attack , Rihanna said she â€œfended him off with my feetâ€ � .
She added that Brown allegedly threatened to kill her , â€œto scare meâ€ � , and that â€œall I kept thinking was , â€˜When is it going to stop?â€ ™ â€ �
She characterised their relationship as â€œdangerousâ€ � :
â€œThe more in love we became , the more dangerous we became for each other , equally as dangerous.â€ �
In the documentary , Brown also recalls how they kept their â€œfairytaleâ€ � relationship secret for eight months before going public at an awards ceremony .
â€œOur power that we had at that age , it was dangerous ...
real life rock stars , at 16 , 17 years old ,
thatâ€ ™ s dangerous , because you can do whatever you want.â€
�
He also asserts : â€œI still love Rihannaâ€ � .
Brownâ€ ™ s career was briefly derailed by the assault incident , with radio stations refusing to play his songs , but he has since had a string of hits including Loyal , Yeah 3x , and Donâ€ ™ t
Wake Me Up .
Brown and Rihanna have since reconciled and recorded together ."
