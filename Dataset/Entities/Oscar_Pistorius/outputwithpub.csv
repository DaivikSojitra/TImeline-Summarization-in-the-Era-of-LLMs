2005-05-15,"Oscar Pistorius took up athletics only 16 months ago .
Already , the 18-year - old South African can run 400 metres in 47.34 seconds .
It takes him a little over 21 seconds to cover 200 m and he has a realistic chance of running the 100 m in under 11 seconds this evening in Manchester .
He has no shins , no ankles and no feet .
He is a double amputee , running on carbon - fibre blades , and is one of the stars of the Paralympic World Cup , the biggest international disability sports event held outside the Paralympic Games .
His rapid improvement in such a short space of time suggests that he could make an impact not just in the Paralympics in Beijing but in the Olympics as well .
He competed against able - bodied competitors in the 400 m at the recent South African championships , finishing sixth , and he has been invited to run in a junior or a B - list 400 m at the IAAF Grand Prix in Helsinki in July . '
The IAAF [ athletics ' world governing body ] started questioning whether a disabled athlete can run able - bodied times and now that 's changed to whether disabled athletes should compete , ' he says .
There is nothing in the IAAF rules to say that Pistorius can or can not compete , but rest assured there will be if he starts performing too well .
The technical committee will ' consider the situation ' after Pistorius runs in Helsinki .
The issue opens a fascinating debate as to what is fair , what is a ' level playing field ' and what is ' open ' competition .
Is it fair that Ian Thorpe was born with size-17 feet that act as flippers in the pool , that Michael Phelps has an unnaturally large arm span of 200 cm ( compared with his height of 193 cm ) ?
Neither of these physical advantages could be achieved by training .
Is it fair that men over 7 ft have such an advantage in basketball because they do n't have to look up to see the net ?
Or that Willie Carson barely had to diet to keep his weight down as a jockey ?
Some people are naturally more flexible than others , some are stronger than others and some have sharper vision and faster reflexes .
The genetic lottery means that Thorpe was ideally suited to swimming but would have struggled as a dancer , while Carson was the perfect shape to be a jockey , but if basketball had been his passion , he would have endured a lifetime of disappointment .
In Pistorius 's case , fate meant that he was born with no fibula in either of his legs .
When he was 11 months old , his parents decided that his legs should be amputated below the knee .
Not an ideal start .
In fact , he started off as a rugby player with an additional passion for tennis and water polo .
After a broken knee stopped him playing rugby in the summer of 2003 , Pistorius decided to take up athletics .
Now he has proved that he can run and has mastered the difficulties of being on artificial limbs , how should his case be viewed ?
Does he have an advantage over runners with two normal legs because the spring in his carbon - fibre limbs gives him more elevation ?
Or is that cancelled out by the fact that he has no ankle flexion and no feet to propel him off the starting blocks ?
Put simply , is it a fair contest , or does he have an unnatural advantage ?
Far from being a case of disabled equals disadvantaged and inferior , Pistorius 's condition raises the fascinating concept that disabled equals unfair advantage .
His case could change the perception of disability sport forever .
There are those who would argue that if Pistorius is allowed to compete , what is to stop athletes putting springs in their shoes to create the same upsurge he enjoys ?
In truth , the only way they could duplicate the sensation and the effect is if they chopped off their lower limbs .
That might make a few think twice , although , given the propensity of some elite athletes to chance their health in favour of enhanced performance , it is not out of the question .
The strange element to this case is that Pistorius will be allowed to compete and then a decision will be made .
So , if he is too good , will he be banned ?
If he is allowed to continue , the IAAF will have to come up with guidelines that control the development of carbon - fibre blades .
In the same way that golf has tried to limit the advance of technology , so the IAAF will have to draw up strict rules on the materials used and the design of artificial limbs .
It is no coincidence that , over 100 m , Pistorius finds it tough against single amputees , whose one able foot helps them at the start .
It takes him a while to get into his stride and even over 200 m he spends the first 75 m trailing the field .
When he gets going , he flies .
In the Athens Paralympics final , he beat Marlon Shirley ( a single amputee ) by 0.7sec , the equivalent of winning by 10 lengths in horse racing .
Over 400 m , with a whole lap of the track to make up for a slow start , he should be even more dominant .
The 400 m has not moved on since Michael Johnson set a world record of 43.18sec at the 1999 world championships in Seville .
That mark still stands and the Olympic gold medal in Athens was won by Jeremy Wariner in an unexceptional time of 44.0sec .
The event might welcome a bit of fresh interest .
Pistorius has three seconds to lose before he can challenge that mark , but he has no doubt that he can do it and fully expects to be in Beijing twice in 2008 .
Whether the IAAF and , ultimately , the International Olympic Committee will let him is another matter .
There will be no such controversy over Natalie du Toit - another South African whose times make her compare favourably with able - bodied athletes - because in swimming no artificial limbs are allowed .
Du Toit lost the lower part of her left leg when she was knocked off her scooter in early 2001 .
She was 17 and had represented her country at the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur as a 14-year - old .
She saw no reason why she should not do so again and as soon as she could after the accident , she was back in the pool .
She was selected for the Commonwealth Games in Manchester and made the final of the 800 m .
She aims to compete at both the Paralympics and the Olympics in 2008 .
There is no doubt that disability sport is progressing at a remarkable rate and the authorities will have to think ahead and move fast to keep up with the competitors .
It would be a shame if Pistorius were given the chance to compete against able - bodied competitors and then had that right taken away after he had achieved a time fast enough to qualify for the Olympics .
Either way , the IAAF and the IOC need to address the issue before , rather than after , the runner has bolted ."
2007-06-28,"Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius will run against Olympic and world champion Jeremy Wariner over 400 metres at next month 's Norwich Union British grand prix in Sheffield .
Pistorius is the double amputee world - record holder for the 100 m , 200 m and 400 m and recently finished runner - up in the 400 m at the South African able - bodied national championships .
"" I 'm delighted to get the opportunity to compete in the Norwich Union British grand prix in Sheffield , "" said Pistorius .
"" I 've always enjoyed competing in Paralympic competitions in Britain and finally I have the chance to compete in a major able - bodied meeting here .
With the likes of Jeremy Wariner in the field I could n't ask for a stronger test , but these are the sort of challenges I want . ""
The 20-year - old sprinter , nicknamed ' Blade Runner ' because of the carbon fibre blades he uses on both legs below the knees , has ambitions to compete in the Beijing Olympics next year .
A head - to - head meeting with Wariner - expected to be one of the top performers at this year 's world championships in Osaka - will be one of the highlights of the July 15 meeting in Sheffield .
Other big names in the race will include Britain 's No1 Tim Benjamin and the Commonwealth champion John Steffensen from Australia .
It had been thought that such a match - up would not be possible after the IAAF passed a rule in March , banning any runner deemed to benefit from artificial help .
However , the IAAF has since clarified its stance and want to use the Sheffield event as a part of its research into whether or not Pistorius gains such an advantage from his blades .
Although his best of 46.34 seconds is outside the qualifying standard for the world championships this year , he would be a likely pick for his country 's 4x400 m relay squad should he be cleared to compete ."
2007-07-10,"Questions , questions , questions .
Oscar Pistorius is going to have to get used to all the questions .
Not just the ones directed at him , but the ones being asked about him .
The ones that his life makes unavoidable .
Is it possible for a double amputee to compete with , and beat , the world 's best able - bodied athletes ?
Do the carbon - fibre running blades ( known as Cheetahs ) that he runs on constitute an unfair advantage ?
Do they only enable him to attain the levels of performance that his body would be capable of anyway ?
Or do they take him beyond what his own natural limits would be ?
It 's a good thing that Pistorius knows his answers well then .
He should do , having been on prosthetic limbs since he was 13 months old .
He was born without either fibula - the long thin bone that runs down the front of the shin and anchors the calf muscle .
A keen rugby player in his youth , he took up sprinting as means of recuperating from a severe injury .
Eight months later , he was a Paralympic gold medallist .
Now he is a triple Paralympic sprint champion , and is some 110 m ahead of his nearest rival over 400 m .
His personal best over that distance , 46.24 , is good enough for him to be a member of South Africa 's 4x400 m relay team in the 2008 Olympics .
If the Olympics will have him .
The first major step in that quest for acceptance begins comes this Sunday , when , for the first time , he will compete with the world 's best 400 m runners in the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Sheffield .
World champion Jeremy Wariner and Britain 's Tim Benjamin will be there , but all eyes will be on the 20-year - old with the journeyman times and the long , sculpted blades strapped to his knees .
"" I 've always wanted to run in a major event , "" he says , "" but before , the opportunity has always been closed to me .
This is awesome .
I 'm being thrown straight in at the deep end . ""
What then , does he want to achieve by running in this race ?
"" My target is clear : a personal best .
If I run 45.99 I 'll be happy . ""
Like most young athletes , he is slightly awestruck by the competition .
"" The top three guys will be too quick .
I 'm not running the times they are .
For me , it 'll be about learning .
I 'll look at the areas of the race where I lose ground - whether that 's on the straight or the bends . ""
So much for the questions directed at him then , brushed off with smooth - cheeked and slightly hyperactive charm , but what of the much harder questions , of the unavoidable issues his disability raises ?
"" There is absolutely no reason why the IAAF should n't let me run , "" he begins .
Many disagree with him , claiming that the design of the Cheetahs gives him an unnaturally long stride , and count as artificial enhancement .
"" I can understand the negativity , but I should be judged on an innocent until proven guilty basis .
Right now the leading experts and scientists in the world have said that I should be allowed to run .
If they find evidence against me I 'd be prepared to stop running .
The debate has been resolved .
It 's old news . ""
He says the key point is that the Cheetahs do not create more energy than the wearer puts in .
They are vastly more inefficient than a human leg .
But they may not be by the time of , say .
the 2012 Olympics .
Pistorius has had 20 years to get used to both his talent and prosthetic limbs .
It may be old news for him , but it 's not for the rest of the world .
The potential that ( and it should be stressed that Pistorius is a long way off this mark ) a double amputee could become world champion just raises too many issues .
"" I 'm not a guinea pig , "" he says , "" my job is to run races "" .
Much as he says it , his life just is n't going to be that easy ."
2007-07-11,"Oscar Pistorius asks if we can spare a moment so that he can retrieve from the back of the room one of the two most controversial limbs in athletics .
He returns carrying his left running leg .
He places on a table a 1.8 kg ( 4 lb ) carbon - fibre prosthetic : it is worth £ 2,000 , and the bottom part is shaped like a curved blade .
As a pair they have helped turn this South African sprinter into one of the best Paralympians of his generation .
Now the athlete known as Blade Runner , or The Fastest Man
On No Legs , is going a step further , while at the same time having a run - in with officialdom and not finding unanimous approval for his presence in the Norwich Union British Grand Prix in Sheffield on Sunday .
At the Don Valley Stadium the 20-year - old Pistorius will run the biggest race of his career , over 400 metres , against the American Olympic champion Jeremy Wariner and six other able - bodied athletes including Britain 's Tim Benjamin .
"" There have been exhibitions in the past but this race is not one , "" he says .
"" I have a dream of competing at the Olympic Games in Beijing next year .
I need to go quicker and to do that I need to run against faster people so their speed can pull me along .
In four to five years ' time I want to be running under 45 seconds .
Why should n't it be possible ? ""
However the International Association of Athletics Federations has started an investigation into whether Pistorius is taking an unfair advantage by wearing the prosthetic legs , ironically called Cheetahs , manufactured by an Icelandic company , Ossur .
IAAF rules forbid competitors from using equipment which might give them an advantage , but Pistorius insists that this is not the case with the artificial legs .
"" I can understand the negativity but it should be innocent until proven guilty , "" says Pistorius , who uses street prosthetics - without the blade - for everyday life .
"" I would like to see what tests they do and comply with them .
At a big meeting like this one , I am not a guinea pig . ""
Another top sprinter in South Africa was running 10.2sec [ for 100 m ] , but because of an accident he is now using the legs and he is running 11.3 .
The legs are not bionic .
They do not give out more energy .
"" If they ever found evidence that I was gaining an advantage , then I would stop running because I would not want to compete at a top level if I knew I had an unfair advantage . ""
Pistorius holds Paralympic world records in the 100 m , 200 m and 400 m , where his time of 46.34 would put him eighth on this year 's able - bodied British rankings , but will need to run at least 45.95 to qualify for Beijing .
On arriving in Europe , he first runs in a B race on Friday evening in Rome where the IAAF will be monitoring his performance , paying particular attention to his increased speed at the finish , which is not normal in a 400 m runner .
The IAAF then has to decide whether Pistorius 's artificial limbs constitute an unfair advantage .
He has never known any different .
He was born with no fibula in either leg and before his first birthday his parents made the decision to have the lower part amputated .
Otherwise , he would have been consigned to a wheelchair .
Despite his disability , sport became his life , though not in track and field .
"" I used to forge sick notes for athletics at school because I did not enjoy it , "" he says .
"" I played tennis , football and water polo and I got into athletics when I had a rugby injury and needed to be fit for the next season .
I started running and it took off from there . ""
He has been competing for only four years and along with his world records , he won a Paralympic gold medal in the 200 m in Athens in 2004 .
In South Africa he regularly runs against able - bodied athletes , but he has been longing to test himself against the world 's best - and none come much faster than Wariner , whose best time is 43.62 .
Benjamin , who ran a personal best of 44.56 when he became Europe 's No1 in 2005 , does not think Pistorius should deprive others of a place in Sheffield , but remains full of admiration .
"" If you have done the standard , you have done the standard .
And the standards are so tough for all of us , "" says Benjamin .
"" But then , with his personal best , he should not be in the race in Sheffield because he is not fast enough .
There are flip sides to it .
It is a good message and I really do hope he does well .
I can not believe the times he is running .
It is amazing . ""
The appearance of Pistorius on Sunday should be a sideshow in the race itself as he should not be able match the times of the able - bodied sprinters .
He does not mind that .
"" I am pretty nervous about it , "" he says .
"" My target is a personal best and if I can run 45.99 , I would be very happy .
I will just go out there and experience what it 's like and hopefully learn a lot . """
2007-07-15,"As signs were put up outside the Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield last night to warn spectators of fresh flooding , one had to wonder what all the fuss had been about inside at the Norwich Union British Grand Prix .
Oscar Pistorius for the Olympic Games ?
It is time to take a rain check on that one .
At the end of an evening of performances affected by awful conditions , and on a track with puddles dotted across it , the grand finale to the night became the big let down .
What we learned from the appearance of the world 's most high - profiled Paraolympian was that maybe he should concentrate a little bit longer on securing his reputation in the event where he has made his name .
Pistorius would not want us to feel that he is brave for putting himself on the line against some of the world 's best able- bodied 400 metre runners , and let us not forget the Olympic message of it being ' not the winning but the taking part ' .
But does athletics really have room for what proved nothing more than a sideshow ?
The fact that Olympic 400 m champion , America 's Jeremy Wariner , hardly made it out of his blocks before stopping was the beginning of the end for a race which saw Pistorius disqualified for running out of his lane .
Even if the result had stood , Pistorius 's time of 47.65 showed that he would need a miracle to qualify for an Olympics where speed , for him , would need to be of the essence just to make the South African team .
From the opening 20 metres Pistorius , running in the outside lane , was trailing .
The main worries of the International Association of Athletics Federations is that his prosthetic legs might give him an unfair advantage , and the fact he ran the second half of the race quicker than the first showed he can achieve split times many able - bodied athletes can not .
But will Pistorius ever be allowed to be in the position to improve his time ?
He says he needs to run against able - bodied competitors to go quicker .
But it is always likely that he will be given the outside lane in such big events and definitely , on times alone and , as speculation had it , just in case he slipped and caused damage to his fellow athletes .
Now , that remains highly unlikely though in those awful conditions last night , he never looked like picking up speed .
At times during the race , it seemed he was doing his best to stay on his artificial limbs .
His decision to bid for the Olympics and show that disabled athletes had as much right to compete at the Games as able - bodied runners , is something he can be proud of .
In his life he has never shirked a challenge and the fact he made it to Sheffield last night was proof that he deserves the chance .
"" I 've really learned a lot from this , "" he said .
"" Things like the way they train and the way they compete .
I have a long , long way to go before I get to that level , "" he added before withdrawing a protest he lodged about his disqualification .
Yet , how can the sport or even Pistorius himself gain by him finishing last ?
He says he would like to make a name for himself at the Olympic Games and that London in 2012 or 2016 would be a realistic target to create any sort of impression in terms of challenging fellow 400 metre runners .
But , after last night 's non - event you can not imagine the world promoters will find slots for him in their main races too often ."
2007-07-16,"Oscar Pistorius last night called the International Association Of Athletics Federations "" unprofessional "" as the biggest night of his career ended in a shambles at the Norwich Union British Grand Prix .
The South African Paralympian was disqualified for running out of his lane after finishing last in the pouring rain in a 400 metres race with able - bodied athletes which fell flat from the moment the gun was fired .
The Olympic champion Jeremy Wariner , of the United States , stumbled out of his blocks and stopped , taking no part in an event in which from the first 10 m it became clear that Pistorius was never going to make an impression .
With the possibility that his carbon fibre prosthetic legs could cause him to slip over on a surface full of puddles following constant rain , Pistorius , running in the outside lane , was quickly passed by Britain 's Martyn Rooney .
Pistorius is determined to show that by competing with able - bodied athletes he can bring his times down towards the 45.95 he would need to qualify for the Olympic Games in Beijing next year , but he gained no mark last night after he was later disqualified .
The 21-year - old was left angry with the sport 's governing body , the IAAF , who used cameras when he ran in Rome on Friday night to monitor whether his artificial legs give him an advantage after saying they will investigate the legality of him running in such races . ""
No one from the IAAF has even talked to me about it , "" he said .
"" It is their duty to do what they think necessary but the comments they have made have been unacceptable and unprofessional .
If I was doing anything wrong , I would not be running .
I would like to work with the IAAF to sort this out . ""
What could be gleaned from last night was that he will need to run a great deal more often against able - bodied athletes to achieve that .
As Angelo Taylor , of the US , won in 45.25 , Pistorius clocked 47.65 before his time was wiped out .
He has a best of 46.34 , but significantly last night he ran quicker in the second half of the race than the first , with hand - timed splits of 24.4 and 23.3 .
One of the IAAF 's main concerns is improvements in the latter stages , which would be out of character with normal 400 m runners .
Pistorius , 20 , known as Blade Runner because of his J - shaped prosthetic limbs , had his legs amputated just below the knee when he was 11 months old because he was born with no fibula bones ."
2007-07-16,"Oscar Pistorius may have to apologise to the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations , Lamine Diack , to ensure the governing body carries on its research into his bid to compete regularly against able - bodied athletes .
The South African double amputee has annoyed the IAAF by calling them "" amateurs "" and "" unprofessional "" and allegedly comparing them to the FBI for the manner of their investigations into his races .
The IAAF has been considering financing further studies into whether Pistorius 's prosthetic legs give him an unfair advantage and they want to take him to their research laboratories in Cologne .
But the athlete 's comments and his performance in Sheffield on Sunday , when he was last in the 400 metres before being disqualified for running out of his lane , have caused some in the IAAF to believe the money could be better spent .
The IAAF 's communications director , Nick Davies , told the athlete 's manager , Peet van Zyl , he was "" outraged by some of the statements "" , particularly Pistorius 's claim that they had not been in touch with him after Davies had contacted Van Zyl last month .
Davies said Van Zyl had apologised yesterday and given an assurance "" that they want to work with us "" .
The IAAF filmed Pistorius running in Rome on Friday night and early indications showed that he had an aerodynamic advantage over the runner beside him , although the studies will continue ."
2007-07-17,"It has been the week of the miracle athlete .
Oscar Pistorius , a 20-year - old amputee sprinter , better known as the Blade Runner , competed in the 400 metres at the Norwich Union British Grand Prix , though he was ultimately disqualified for running out of lane .
Pistorius is undoubtedly a great story of triumph - he was born with both fibulae missing - and controversy .
But perhaps we have concentrated on the wrong miracle athlete .
In last weekend 's English Schools ' Championships an 18-year - old , Ryan Farrington , finished fourth in the senior boys ' 100 m and won a gold medal with the West Midlands sprint relay team .
At seven Ryan started shaking and developed problems with his speech .
He was diagnosed with dystonia , a neurological condition similar to Parkinson 's disease .
There is no known cure and it is extremely rare for children to suffer from it .
By nine Ryan was having terrible spasms and could no longer walk properly .
By 11 he was confined to a wheelchair , which he was forced to use for the next two years . ""
The pain was unbearable , "" he says .
"" I ca n't really describe it . ""
His mother Lisa can : "" He used to scream constantly .
The spasms down his back were so bad that it looked as if his skin was rippling .
"" When things were at their worst , Ryan would be admitted to hospital and put on methadone .
He was told that the only permanent pain relief ( diazepam injected into the spine ) would leave him unable to walk - and that even without such relief he might not walk again .
"" I said straightaway , ' No chance ' , "" he says , "" went back to physio and practised walking using hand rails .
After they told me I might not walk again I was so determined .
"" Whenever he felt down , his physio , Samantha Butts , told him not to give up .
Things improved .
When he regained movement in his back he decided he wanted to learn taekwondo - he is now a black belt .
Next he decided he wanted to play football .
Then he decided he wanted to run fast . ""
Ryan 's always been in a rush to get everything done because he does n't know what tomorrow holds , "" says Lisa .
At 15 he joined Birchfield Harriers , the celebrated athletics club that nurtured Denise Lewis , Ashia Hansen and Mark Lewis - Francis .
Amazingly Ryan is now Staffordshire champion at 100 m ( 10.86 sec ) , 200 m ( 22.19 ) and 400 m ( 51.9 ) .
He is coached by Steve Platt , who guided Lewis - Francis to gold in the Olympic 100 m relay .
"" I wish all my athletes were like him , "" Platt says .
"" Rather than tell him to do more , sometimes you 've got to stop him .
It 's incredible how he can run like this when he ca n't even walk properly .
I think it 's the momentum that carries him along . ""
Those who never saw Ryan in a wheelchair can not believe he was ever in one and those who did can not believe he is now running .
One consultant told him to quit athletics because it could aggravate his condition .
He ignored him .
"" I thought it was stupid , "" he says .
"" In my opinion it 's making me stronger and it ca n't be making me any worse . ""
When he runs he feels pain free .
Ryan , who is still looking for a sponsor , refuses to think of himself as disabled .
He recently applied to university .
When he received a form for disabled applicants he told his mum : "" I ai n't disabled .
I 'm just a little bit dodgy . ""
Lisa finds it hard to believe the progress her son has made .
"" You ca n't describe how you feel .
You cry at any point .
In my heart just to see him get on the line and run is fantastic .
You could n't wish for any more than for him just to be there . ""
But Ryan does .
He wants to represent his country .
"" My main priority is to get a GB vest - for anything . ""
He knows it will be hard .
There are days when the pain is so bad he can not get out of bed and has to cosh himself with codeine .
At the end of races he often holds his back with his hands and limps away like an old man . ""
He could wake up and not be able to walk tomorrow , "" Lisa says .
"" We try not to think about that .
It 's something we do n't talk about .
Ryan says , ' It 's not going to happen to me . ' ""
Could Ryan be a contender in 2012 ?
Platt thinks it is too early to say but he is not ruling it out .
"" Ryan 's got to go considerably faster , "" he says , "" but the potential is there . ""
What a story that would be - the boy who was told he might not walk again , sprinting for Britain at the London Olympics .
It is a dream scenario , of course .
But if anybody can make the impossible possible , it has to be Ryan Farrington ."
2008-01-10,"Oscar Pistorius , the South African Paralympic sprinter , is likely to learn today that he will not be given the go - ahead to run in the Olympic Games in Beijing .
The International Association of Athletics Federations will make public its findings after spending € 50,000 ( £ 38,000 ) on research into whether his J - shaped prosthetic limbs give him an advantage over able - bodied competitors .
A 30-page document has been produced by Gert - Peter Brüggemann , a professor of biomechanics at the German Sport University in Cologne , after Pistorius spent two days with him during November .
Brüggemann has concluded that the artificial limbs give Pistorius a "" considerable advantage "" .
Pistorius , 21 , whose legs were amputated below the knee when he was only 11 months old because he had been born without fibulas , is the Paralympic 200 m champion and holds three world records .
He has been campaigning to run at the major able ...
#8209;bodied championships , arguing that he is not given an advantage .
He competed in a B race in the Golden League in Rome in July and was second in the 400 m before , two days later , finishing last in the rain in Sheffield and then being disqualified for running out of his lane .
IAAF rule 144.2 prohibits the use of any technical device that can aid performance and the world ruling body will base its decision on Brüggemann 's report .
It is happy that its findings have come from what it considers the best laboratory in the world and it has no plans to carry out further research .
Pistorius received a copy of the report before Christmas but had not responded to the IAAF by last night .
He will plan to fight on in his battle for acceptance but , because the Olympic athletics events are run under IAAF rules , he will have nowhere to turn if the ruling body does not allow him to compete .
He was tested on November 12 and 13 in Cologne along with six able - bodied athletes whose 400 m personal bests were comparable to the South African 's 46.56sec .
They were put through a series of tests over 400 m on an outdoor track , having body scans to match data and running indoors at the laboratory , where they were monitored by 16 cameras .
When Pistorius ran in Rome , IAAF analysis showed an unorthodox strategy to his pacing .
It is believed that , whereas able - bodied 400 m runners slow down in the 200 - 300 m stage of the one - lap event , Pistorius increases speed .
Significantly , in Sheffield , his time of 47.65 showed a quicker second half to the race than the first , with hand - timed splits of 24.4 and 23.3 .
He was determined to make the qualifying standard of 45.95 for this year 's Olympic Games in Beijing , but even if he were accepted into the major championships he would be unlikely to make an impression .
His time in Rome was 46.90 ; the American Jeremy Wariner won Olympic gold in Athens in 2004 in 44.00 .
Pistorius 's limbs , made out of carbon fibre by the Icelandic company Ossur , are called "" Cheetahs "" and the argument revolves around whether the blades provide him with greater bounce and length with each stride .
There also remains concern within the sport that not enough is known about the blades and that they could be further modified , and that if Pistorius were allowed to compete in the major championships it would open the way for other disabled athletes to do the same .
The IAAF brought in a rule in March last year banning any runner who might be gaining from artificial help , before allowing Pistorius to compete in Rome and Sheffield .
The South African has had support from the Ossur chief executive , Jon Sigurdsson , who last month wrote to the IAAF president , Lamine Diack .
Sigurdsson said : "" Based on the biomechanics alone , it is simply not possible for him [ Pistorius ] or any amputee to have an advantage over the able - bodied . ""
Brüggemann 's case , on which the IAAF council based its decision , was that the limbs provided the leg with greater recovery power .
He said they "" give back 90 % of the impact energy , compared with the human foot which can only return 60 % "" .
The professor saw a clear advantage for Pistorius .
"" We 're talking more than just a few percentage points .
I had n't expected it to be so clear - cut .
You have to draw the line somewhere .
A racing bike without gears is not put into competition against a road bike that has gears . ""
Last month Pistorius was honoured at the BBC Sports Personality Of The Year awards when he received the Helen Rollason Award for an athlete showing courage in the face of adversity .
He could not be contacted for comment last night ."
2008-01-11,"The proposed announcement by the International Association of Athletics Federations on whether Oscar Pistorius can compete in the Olympics was delayed after the South African Paralympian failed to respond to the report commissioned into his prosthetic limbs .
The IAAF is poised to reveal its findings tomorrow , when the sprinter is likely to be told he will not be allowed to run in Beijing this summer .
Pistorius , 21 , has been determined to prove that his carbon - fibre legs do not give him an advantage but tests carried out by Professor Gert - Peter Brueggemann , a scientist specialising in biomechanics at the German sports university in Cologne , have indicated they do .
The 200 m Paralympic champion , who ran in able - bodied races in Rome and Sheffield last year , was expected to respond to the document which Brueggemann produced after Pistorius spent two days with him at his laboratory in November .
He was sent the report before Christmas .
Pistorius has not had the greatest of relationships with the IAAF but it was expected he would have replied by yesterday after it had revealed the dates it wanted to make the report public .
His representatives were unavailable for comment .
Before the body decided to investigate his case last summer , he said : "" The least they could do is give me the chance to fight my fight and work with me and not against me .
There has been a breakdown in communications between myself and the IAAF . ""
Born without fibulae , Pistorius had both legs amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old but wearing his J - shaped limbs , he has broken three world records .
The downfall of Marion Jones will be completed in a Winchester County court in White Plains , New York , today .
Just over seven years since she won 100 m gold at the Olympic Games in Sydney , the American is expected to be handed a six - month jail sentence for lying to federal investigators about using steroids and cheque fraud - a remarkable end to the career of a sprinter once deemed the greatest woman athlete of her generation .
Jones , 32 , lied about using anabolic steroids and fraud in a cheque scam involving her one - time partner Tim Montgomery , the former 100 m world record holder .
She has returned the five medals she won in Sydney but the International Olympic Committee has yet to decide whether to upgrade the 100 m runner - up , Katerina Thanou - the Greek who was banned in 2004 for missing drugs tests ."
2008-01-14,"Oscar Pistorius , the double amputee athlete , has been ruled ineligible to compete at the Olympic Games by the International Association of Athletics Federations .
The findings of a two - day independent investigation into whether Pistorius 's prosthetic running limbs constituted an unfair advantage over other athletes were announced this morning .
An IAAF statement said that the South African 's "" cheetah "" running blades were technical aids and as such were in clear contravention of IAAF rules .
This means effectively that he is banned from competing against able - bodied athletes .
"" It is evident that an athlete using the "" Cheetah "" prosthetic is able to run at the same speed as able - bodied athletes with lower energy consumption , "" continued the statement .
"" Running with prosthetic blades leads to less vertical motion combined with less mechanical work for lifting the body .
As well as this , the energy loss in the blade is significantly lower than in the human ankle joints in sprinting at maximum speed .
""
An athlete using this prosthetic blade has a demonstrable mechanical advantage ( more than 30 % ) when compared to someone not using the blade .
"" Pistorius 's manager Peet van Zyl confirmed that the athlete would appeal , most likely at the Court of Arbitration for Sport .
"" We are obviously very disappointed with the IAAF decision and we need to talk with them and our legal advisors about how we progress , what we need to do to appeal in terms of the IAAF regulations , "" said Van Zyl .
The IAAF announcement confirmed the opinion expressed last month by Professor Peter Bruggemann who conducted the investigation at the German Sport university in Cologne last November .
Pistorius underwent tests over two days with five able - bodied athletes who were capable of similar levels of performance at 400 m .
Pistorius , along with his coaches and advisors as well as the company that manufactures his blades , Ossur , has always maintained that the limbs do not give him an unnatural advantage over other competitors ."
2008-01-15,"Oscar Pistorius says he will look at every legal loophole to find a way into the Olympic Games after the International Association of Athletics Federations confirmed yesterday that his prosthetic limbs are a technical aid and he can not run in their events .
The IAAF said the South African double amputee has too great an advantage over able - bodied competitors when he competes on J - Shaped Cheetah limbs .
Pistorius , 21 , the paralympic 200 m champion and triple world record - holder , spent two days in Cologne undergoing tests paid for by the IAAF with Gert - Peter Brueggemann , a bio - mechanics professor .
One of the key findings announced by the IAAF from the report was that the prosthetic blade used 25 % less energy than able - bodied runners to run at the same speed .
But Pistorius 's agent , Peet van Zyl , said : "" We would have to sit down with our legal team in terms of the way forward .
The natural feeling from our side would be to appeal the verdict and see what avenues we can take forward .
Oscar wants to prove that he is n't getting an advantage . ""
The IAAF said it was clear that an athlete using the Cheetah prosthetic was able to run at the same speed as able - bodied athletes with lower energy consumption . ""
Running with prosthetic blades leads to less vertical motion combined with less mechanical work for lifting the body , "" said the body .
Pistorius will not be allowed to compete at any IAAF competition such as the Olympics and World Championships but he might find a way of appealing to the European court of appeal .
"" Based on the feedback that we got , "" said Van Zyl , "" the general feeling was that there were a lot of variables that were n't taken into consideration and that all avenues had not been explored in terms of coming to a final conclusion on whether Oscar was getting some advantage or not . """
2008-04-28,"Oscar Pistorius , the 400 m Paralympic sprinter dubbed "" the fastest man on no legs "" , will tomorrow bid to prove that his prosthetic limbs do not give him an advantage .
The South African remains determined he will be competing at this summer 's Olympic Games in Beijing as he begins his appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) in Lausanne .
"" If the blades give an advantage , "" insisted Pistorius , "" why are the other Paralympic athletes not running the times I am achieving ? ""
The Paralympic world record - holder at 100 m , 200 m and 400 m refused to give in after the International Association of Athletics Federations ruled against him in January following their official study into the use of his prosthetic j - shaped legs .
The IAAF had sent Pistorius for a series of tests to Cologne with Gert - Peter Brueggemann , a bio - mechanics professor .
His findings revealed that the prosthetic blade used 25 % less energy than able - bodied runners at the same speed .
Since then , Pistorius , 21 , has called in expert help from France and the USA and insisted he has evidence to show that he should be allowed to compete alongside able - bodied athletes .
He said : "" I do n't know what the motives are for the IAAF making the decisions they did , but ... things are going to unravel and I hope for a better outcome .
There is a lot of discrimination against disabled people and I do n't think all the variables were considered .
"" I feel that it is my responsibility on behalf of myself and all other disabled athletes to stand firmly and not allow one organization to inhibit our ability to compete using the very tools without which we simply can not walk , let alone run .
I will not stand down .
"" This case is important not just to me , but to all disabled persons who just ask for the chance to compete fairly on the sporting field with able - bodied athletes . "" Pistorius made high - profile appearances in able - bodied 400 m races last year , finishing second in Rome and then last - before being disqualified for running out of his lane - in Sheffield .
The CAS hearing is scheduled to last two days , and Pistorius is likely to know the outcome within a month .
But even if he is allowed to compete in Beijing , then he will be faced with the tough problem of actually qualifying for the Games .
The Olympics in Beijing are only 101 days away and he stills needs to achieve a 400 m qualifying time of 45.95 secs .
His best , the Paralympic world record , is 46.56 .
He knows he needs to find as many able - bodied races to help him improve his times .
Pistorius had his legs amputated below the knee when he was only 11 months old after being born with no fibula bones and in Athens four years ago , he won the 200 m at the Paralympic Games .
He is also known as Blade Runner because of the shape of his prosthetics and his dream of competing at the Olympics took on a greater relevance in 2005 when , at the South African Championships , he finished sixth in an able - bodied 400 m ."
2008-05-16,"Oscar Pistorius was yesterday cleared to run at this summer 's Olympic Games , and immediately received the backing of the International Amateur Athletics Federation to achieve his Beijing dream .
The South African double amputee , who runs wearing J - shape prosthetics , won his appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport after the IAAF decided that his artificial legs gave him an advantage .
"" I am ecstatic , "" said the so - called "" Blade Runner "" .
"" When I found out I cried .
It is a battle that has been going on for far too long .
It 's a great day for sport .
This day is going to go down in history for the equality of disabled people .
I can definitely say the truth has come out .
We have the opportunity to chase my dream of participating in an Olympics , if not in 2008 then in 2012 .
""
The IAAF president , Lamine Diack , said : "" The IAAF accepts the decision of CAS and Oscar will be welcomed wherever he competes this summer .
He is an inspirational man and we look forward to admiring his achievements in the future . ""
Pistorius , the Paralympic 200 m champion , runs in 400 m races in able - bodied events .
Now his task will begin .
He has a personal best at the distance of 46.56sec but still needs to run the "" A "" standard of 45.55 to ensure definite qualification for Beijing for the individual event .
He could still make the South African relay team because qualifying times are not needed .
Pistorius , 21 , who was born without fibula bones and had the lower part of his legs amputated when he was 11 months old , never gave up after the IAAF investigations into his prosthetics .
He had further tests at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where the findings showed his "" Cheetah "" legs did not give him an extra edge against able - bodied runners .
"" I am thrilled with the panel 's findings and hope that it silences many of the crazy theories that have been circulating in recent months about my having an unfair advantage , "" added Pistorius .
It is a huge breakthrough for disabled athletes .
But Britain 's greatest Paralympian , Dame Tanni Grey - Thompson , hoped it would not have the wrong type of knock - on effect for Pistorius 's event in the Paralympics themselves .
She said : "" For Oscar , it is huge and I can understand why he is doing it .
He will be the first Paralympian who is truly known worldwide and the movement will benefit from it . ""
But the argument goes much deeper than Oscar .
What happens is that , if he runs at the Olympics , they have to take his event out of the Paralympics because I would not want the Paralympics race becoming the "" B "" event or the "" B "" final .
It is never going to happen in wheelchair racing because there is no way we could ever drop into the women 's 800 m . ""
If Oscar is seen to be making the jump from Paralympics to Olympics , then the Paralympics is immediately B finals .
I do n't ever want it to be that .
He has always said he wants to run both but there is something about that which does not feel quite right .
It is a much wider debate about whether he runs or not .
It is the whole future of his event at the Paralympics Games which is under discussion . ""
Pistorius will now seek races across Europe and is likely to return to Rome , where he finished second in an able - bodied event last summer , and possibly back to Britain .
Last July he competed at the Norwich Union British Grand Prix in Sheffield where he was disqualified for running out of his lane .
Giselle Davies , communications director of the International Olympic Committee , said last night :
"" The IOC respects the decision of CAS .
Oscar is a determined and gutsy athlete who will now no doubt put all his energy into reaching the qualification standards for the Olympic Games .
If he makes it we would be delighted to welcome him .

2008-05-16,"The double - amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius today won his appeal to compete for a spot in this year 's Beijing Olympics .
The decision , taken by the Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) , overturns a ban on Pistorius competing against able - bodied athletes , and thus allows him to run in all International Association of Athletics Federation ( IAAF ) sanctioned events .
The IAAF had ruled in January that the 21-year - old Pistorius could not compete with able - bodied athletes because the carbon - fibre blades attached to both legs gave him an advantage .
However , after a two - day meeting of CAS , world sports highest tribunal , disagreed .
"" I am thrilled with the panel 's findings and hope that it silences many of the crazy theories that have been circulating in recent months about my having an unfair advantage , "" said Pistorius .
"" My focus throughout this appeal has been to ensure that disabled athletes be given the chance to compete and compete fairly with able - bodied athletes .
I look forward to continuing my quest to qualify for the Olympics . ""
Pistorius ' lawyers countered with independent tests conducted by a team led by MIT professor Hugh M Herr which claimed to show he does n't gain any advantage over able - bodied runners .
CAS said the IAAF failed to prove that Pistorius ' running blades gave him an advantage . ""
The panel was not persuaded that there was sufficient evidence of any metabolic advantage in favour of a double - amputee using the Cheetah Flex - Foot , "" CAS said . ""
Furthermore , the CAS panel has considered that the IAAF did not prove that the biomechanical effects of using this particular prosthetic device gives Oscar Pistorius an advantage over other athletes not using the device . ""
Pistorius , who was born without fibulas and was 11 months old when his legs were amputated below the knee , must still reach a qualifying time to run in the individual 400 m in Beijing .
However , he can be picked for the South African relay squad without qualifying ."
2008-05-18,"Lamine Diack , the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations , is cautious about the implications of the successful appeal by ' blade runner ' Oscar Pistorius .
Speaking at the grand prix in Dakar , in his native Senegal , Diack said that it was important to monitor any changes to the prostheses that the South African uses , but accepted Friday 's decision by the Court of Arbitration for Sport to allow him to try to qualify for the Beijing Olympics . '
We came to the conclusion that the Cheetah [ prostheses ] gave an advantage , ' Diack said , ' and given that advantage , it would help him win - so we decided that it was not possible for him to compete .
But he was right to go to CAS , which he did , and they said that it was not fully established that there was an advantage .
So I am happy for that , because he is a special case . '
He is a boy born into this situation - having had an operation after 11 months , not an accident at 11 years - and after the operation , he used to consider himself like a normal boy - running , playing football and rugby and so on .
We understand that he wants to compete in able - bodied competition , which he used to do in South Africa .
But we have to be careful what can happen using these kinds of devices , which is why we made our original rule .
Now it 's OK , because he is going to run . '
Asked if he was happy that CAS said that they will reconsider their decision if there are changes to the advice , Diack said : ' The decision is not definitive .
We have to be careful about any kind of people using a special device . '
But asked if was now backing Pistorius ' bid to qualify , he added : ' If he manages to make it , that 's OK . '
Pistorius will try to achieve the time he needs to compete in the Olympic 400 metres in Beijing at a meeting in Milan on 2 July .
The 21-year - old must run 45.55sec to qualify for the Games , which , significantly , is more than a second quicker than his Paralympic world record of 46.56 . '
A lot of the time this year we 've devoted to the court case , ' Pistorius said . '
Now when I get home my time can be dedicated to training .
I am going to have to start getting my body in shape in order to run those qualifying times .
I am hopeful there will be enough time
but it is going to be very difficult . '"
2008-07-02,"Oscar Pistorius was left frustrated after failing in his first attempt to qualify for the Olympics since being given the all - clear to pursue a place in Beijing .
The South African paralympian was fourth in the able - bodied B race at the Notturna International in Milan in 47.78sec last night , slowing in the home straight as he chased the qualifying time of 45.55 .
"" I am a bit disappointed , "" he said .
"" I did n't expect to be wonderful
but I did n't expect to be this bad .
But I have to be realistic .
I have n't run in about a year . ""
Pistorius , 21 , a double amputee who competes wearing J - shaped prosthetic limbs , will now have another crack at the time during the Golden League meeting in Rome tomorrow week before racing in Lucerne the week after .
Last night he was also outside his personal best of 46.36 .
In May the Court of Arbitration for Sport found that his carbon - fibre limbs did not give him an advantage against able - bodied runners , but in a slow race he was not quick enough to beat the Italian Fiorenzo Moscatelli , who won in 47.26 .
Pistorius is concerned that he may not have enough time to qualify for the individual event in Beijing and is hoping to be selected for South Africa 's 4x400 m squad , which does not require a qualifying mark . ""
London 2012 is a more realistic target , "" he said before last night 's race .
"" Sprinters usually reach their peak between 26 and 29 .
I will be 25 in London and I 'll also have two , three years ' preparation . ""
Nicola Sanders , who finished second in the 400 m at last year 's world championships in Osaka , ran the fastest time by a Briton this season when she won in Milan in 50.88 , beating Cuba 's Libania Grenot , second in 51.16 , with Amantle Montsho of Botswana third in 51.23 .
It was good night for Britain as Jemma Simpson broke her personal best in the 800 m by 0.82 , winning in 1min 59.17sec .
Martyn Rooney maintained his fine form to win the 400 m in 45.44 , Simeon Williamson triumphed in the 100 m in 10.27 , Michael Rimmer was first in the 800 m in 1:46.11 and Andy Turner won the 110 m hurdles in 13.68 ."
2008-07-18,"The double - amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius has seen his last hope of making South Africa 's Olympic team for Beijing 2008 disappear , after the country 's track and field body confirmed he had not made their 400 m relay team .
Pistorius had hoped his personal best qualifying time of 46.25sec would be good enough to win him a place in the relay , despite the fact it was outside the Olympic requirement of 45.55sec .
But Athletics South Africa president Leonard Chuene stated this morning that four other hopefuls had posted faster times .
The decision will disappoint Pistorius , though it was not entirely unexpected .
He has spent much of the past year mounting a successful legal challenge to the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) 's ruling that his prosthetic legs served as technical aids , and acknowledged that the process has taken a toll on his training .
"" I have to be realistic .
I have n't run in about a year , "" he said at an athletics meeting in Milan a fortnight ago . ""
London 2012 is a more realistic target .
Sprinters usually reach their peak between 26 and 29 .
I will be 25 in London and I 'll also have two , three years ' preparation . ""
Nevertheless Pistorius remains wary of the IAAF , and accused them of trying to undermine his bid despite the CAS verdict , after officials raised concerns over other competitors ' safety should he run in the relay , and said the need to keep checking his prosthetics before every race would be a major strain .
The IAAF responded yesterday by with a statement insisting it supported Pistorius ' bid to run at the Games , but today 's announcement has rendered it a moot point ."
2008-07-18,"The South African double - amputee sprinter , Oscar Pistorius , has failed to meet the qualifying standard for the Olympics and has no chance of competing in the 400 m in Beijing , it was confirmed last night .
Pistorius , nicknamed "" Blade Runner "" for his use of specially designed prosthetic limbs , won a legal fight in May to run alongside able - bodied athletes .
Although he achieved a personal best of 46.25sec over 400 metres when finishing third at an international meeting in Lucerne on Wednesday night , he still fell short of the 45.55sec Olympic A qualifying mark and will therefore not join the South Africa team .
The president of Athletics South Africa , Leonard Chuene , defended the 21-year - old 's exclusion from both the individual event and the relay , saying : "" He did not qualify in any way because the athletes that have been selected have all run faster than him . ""
Chuene also confirmed that Pistorius would not be considered as a potential stand - by should injuries hit the squad .
"" There is no chance that he will make it even if someone pulls out .
We allowed him to run on the 16th for the final time , where he did not qualify and that was the end . ""
The team was selected on merit and nothing else .
The ones with the fastest times are in the team .
It was not selected under special terms or treatment .
The standards are obviously IAAF and Olympic standards so it 's not us that determines these standards . ""
"" From the beginning we knew that he had to qualify , "" Pistorius 's manager , Peet van Zyl , said before the decision was announced yesterday .
"" We did n't expect him to be granted any special opportunity or anything .
The rules are the rules . ""
The International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) insisted this week that it fully supported Pistorius 's campaign to run at the Olympics , despite its general secretary , Pierre Weiss , expressing concerns that Pistorius might pose a danger to other athletes because of the blade - like prosthetics he uses to run .
The New York legal firm of Dewey and Leboeuf , which represented Pistorius , threatened legal action against the IAAF , demanding that it withdraw a statement that it did not have the resources to check the legality of his blades before each race .
"" That kind of implies that I would cheat , "" he said .
"" It is sad that they think that . ""
He has always maintained that his Cheetah prosthetics do not give him an unnatural advantage over other competitors .
The IAAF ruled in January that they were "" technical aids "" in violation of regulations but the Court of Arbitration for Sport overturned that decision in May.
Pistorius was born without fibulas in both legs .
He has set records in the 100 m , 200 m and 400 m sprints at Paralympic events .
Yesterday 's announcement means he is now likely to compete in the Paralympic Games in September , also in Beijing ."
2009-02-22,"Double - amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius has sustained head and facial injuries in a boat accident but his manager said today that the 22-year - old South African runner intended to get back on the track soon .
Pistorius had surgery today and was in a stable condition in the intensive care unit of a Johannesburg hospital where he was airlifted after Saturday night 's accident .
"" Everything can be repaired surgically , "" said Anchen Laubscher , the principal medical officer of the emergency service that evacuated Pistorius .
"" He is fine .
His brain is functioning normally .
He will soon be discharged and taken home to make a full recovery . ""
His manager , Peet van Zyl , said Pistorius still hoped to compete in the 100- and 400-metre races at the Paralympic World Championships in Manchester in May subject to medical clearance .
Pistorius is the Paralympic gold medalist in the two disciplines , as well as the 200 m . ""
Oscar will be back on the track sooner rather than later , "" Van Zyl said .
"" He has sustained no leg , arm or rib damage . ""
Pistorius was boating with a friend on the Vaal river near Johannesburg on Saturday when the vessel apparently hit something , Laubscher said .
Paramedics stabilised him at the scene before airlifting him to the hospital .
Pistorius had his legs were amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old because he had no fibulas , but he became one of the world 's top disabled athletes .
Last year , he won a legal battle to be able to compete against able - bodied athletes after an appeals court overturned objections by the International Association of Athletics Federations that his carbon - fibre prosthetic racing blades could give him an unfair advantage .
The IAAF ban that kept him off the track was overturned in time for the Beijing Olympics , but Pistorius missed the 400 m qualifying time of 45.55secs .
He still managed to run a personal best 46.25secs while enmeshed in the legal struggles ."
2009-02-22,"Oscar Pistorius is expected to make a full recovery from the injuries he sustained in a weekend boating accident , despite ­initial fears that the man who became one of the most successful Paralympians in Beijing last summer might not be able to ­compete again .
There had even been fears that his life was under threat .
Pistorius , the winner of three Paralympic gold medals and the holder of world records in the 100 , 200 and 400 metres , was flung from a speedboat he was steering on the Vaal River , south of Johannesburg .
There were obvious concerns that his injuries could prove fatal when he was ­airlifted to a Johannesburg hospital known to deal with head injuries and was placed on a ventilator upon arrival .
The 22-year - old , who first came to prominence by winning the 200 m at the 2004 Athens Paralympics , was ­operated on by surgeons for most of this afternoon , providing an anxious wait for his family and friends and a South African public who hailed him as a hero after the almost complete failure of their able - bodied athletes in the Beijing ­Olympics last summer .
The doctors at the Millpark Hospital were busy mending a number of facial ­fractures , especially around Pistorius 's jaw and nose .
According to Pistorius 's ­manager , Peet van Zyl , they were pleased with the results . ""
The doctors are quite happy with how the operation went and they expect Oscar to make a full recovery , "" Van Zyl said tonight .
"" With all the damage to his face and swelling around his airways , the use of a ventilator was purely a safety measure .
But still , it is a tremendous relief that he is conscious again now in ICU [ the intensive care unit ] .
"" The Millpark principal medical officer , Anchen Laubscher , said of Pistorius : "" He is fine .
Everything can be repaired ­surgically .
His brain is functioning normally .
He will soon be discharged and taken home to make a full recovery . ""
Pistorius was transferred to the ICU for normal post - operative observation and is not expected to miss the key events of the European athletics season , ­particularly the world championships in Berlin in August .
However , the accident is another major training disruption for the "" Blade ­Runner "" and his hopes of taking on the best able‑bodied athletes over 400 m .
In January last year the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) ruled that his ­prosthetic legs were ­giving him an unfair advantage and banned him from competing against able - bodied athletes .
Pistorius appealed the ban and took his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport , which cleared him to compete .
These legal wrangles took up the first five months of 2008 , however , and he was unable to qualify for South Africa 's Olympic team , although he showed what he was capable of with his superb ­performances in the Paralympics .
Pistorius is an immensely popular man who has never considered himself disabled , but rather "" differently abled "" .
News of his accident shocked South Africans , who are unaccustomed to major international success in track and field events .
His family expected him to be ­discharged from hospital in a few days and are confident that he will rebound from yet another disappointment .
The former rugby player was expected to compete in a meeting for able - bodied athletes in Port Elizabeth on Friday night but then injured his knee in the gym .
He decided to join family and friends at the Vaal River , a popular leisure destination about 75 km south of Johannesburg .
Pistorius suffered a serious knee injury playing rugby at school and took up ­running in 2004 .
He had both legs amputated in the middle of the shin in 1987 because of the congenital absence of the fibulas or calf bones ."
2009-03-17,"The double - amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius will compete at the Paralympic World Cup in Manchester after recovering from injuries sustained in a boating accident in South Africa last month .
Pistorius will run the 100 m and 400 m at the event on 24 May.
The 22-year - old sustained head and facial injuries in a boating accident near Johannesburg on 21 February and underwent surgery .
His recovery has gone better than expected and he says he will be at full strength at the World Cup .
Pistorius had his legs amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old because he had no calf bones and has become one of the world 's top disabled athletes , winning three gold medals at the Paralympics in Beijing last year ."
2009-05-18,"Oscar Pistorius is not one to sit still .
The double amputee triple world record holder skips about , fetching chairs and coffees , looking after others as he talks about competing in the Paralympic World Cup in Manchester this week .
Watching him move is fascinating .
He challenges every stereotypical notion about what it means – and how it must feel - to be disabled .
Pistorius has had prosthetic legs since he was 11 months old but in sports - mad South Africa his parents raised him like any other child , even playing rugby at school .
"" I think mentally it probably built me up .
It made me strong in the sense that I do n't see difference , a competition is a competition , it 's not disabled or abled . ""
At boarding school in Pretoria the other kids treated him as an equal , playing pranks on him as mercilessly as anyone else .
"" My mates used to hide my legs in the morning .
I 'm not a morning person anyway
so I was always late having to look for my legs which would be hidden on top of a locker or something .
"" Learning about disabled sport came much later in his life .
"" I only started competing in disabled sport four years ago .
At first it was really weird , I had this stereotype
a lot of people have about disabled sport being a second grade version of able - bodied sport , then I got into it
and I realised how wrong I was . ""
But as Pistorius blew the paralympic world away – setting world records in the 100 , 200 and 400 metres –
the-22 year - old quickly realised that to run even faster he would also have to compete against able - bodied athletes at the highest international level .
It was not an easy concept for people to get their head round . ""
When people say , ' Why do you want to run in the Olympics ? '
they 're like , '
You 're not going to win . '
People who ask that question are people that do n't understand the theory of running to run your best time , they are people who run to win .
But it 's not just about winning .
If I run in the Olympics , my chances of running a personal best are very good because I 'm running against guys way stronger than me . ""
His attitude has not been welcomed by everyone .
When Pistorius announced his intention to compete in the 400 m at the Olympic Games in Beijing – against able - bodied runners – he was viewed with suspicion by the International Association of Athletics Federations .
The accusation was that his prosthetic legs – Cheetah Flex - Foot carbon fibre limbs – gave him an unfair advantage .
A ban was promptly put in place and the IAAF probably thought that would be the end of it .
It thought wrong .
Pistorius gathered together 12 of the best biomechanical scientists in the world – "" we got the leading scientist in artificial intelligence , guys who have been testing hopping patterns of kangaroos for the last 30 years and breathing patterns in elephants , it was incredible "" –
together they took the case to the court of arbitration for sport , and won .
Ultimately Pistorius failed to make the 400 m qualifying time of 45.55 seconds , missing out by 0.3sec , but it was a landmark decision that made him an international hero . ""
Afterwards I received emails from around the world from athletes saying they had not been able to compete at their state or club meet because of the IAAF decision but now they could .
The court case was horrendous for me but the verdict made it worthwhile . ""
A look at those prosthetics makes the whole episode seem farcical .
From a distance they look space - age but in close - up they are crudely cut pieces of carbon fibre bolted onto wooden boards , the leg joints softened with bits of old grey foam .
Pistorius groans describing how they feel to wear .
"" They 're so uncomfortable !
I hate them , "" he says , "" they 're so tight because they ca n't be loose because of loss of energy .
I wear them an hour - and - a - half a day and when I take them off
I 'm ripping them off .
They 're very low tech .
The carbon fibre is a great invention but there 's nothing really to them . ""
You get some scientists or professors with doctorates and some of these okes [ guys ] , you read their stuff
and you think , this guy 's never had experience of artificial limbs .
Gert - Peter Brüggemann [ the scientist employed by the IAAF in their case ] was set up so badly by the IAAF .
The tests they made him do were completely misdirected .
They asked him to do a VO2 max test – for a sprinter that 's like the stupidest shit ever .
They lost their case so badly it was a joke .
They just made such stupid comments .
I do n't think they ever thought I 'd take it up further , they thought I 'd just roll over . ""
After losing so much time fighting court cases last season Pistorius had hoped to crack the 400 m qualifying time for the world championships this summer .
But the daredevil athlete , known for riding motorbikes and driving fast cars , had a wake - up call when he crashed his boat in February , breaking ribs and smashing his face .
Pistorius admits he was lucky to survive .
"" My friend and I just wanted to have a chilled weekend
so we took the boat for a ride down the river .
The water level was high because of all the rain in January and there was a pier that was hidden under the water .
We were riding on the river at dusk and we were riding into the sun .
I just did n't see the pier .
When we hit it I went straight into the steering wheel .
I broke my ribs and my jaw and smashed my eye socket .
I still have n't got much feeling in my nose , my cheek or my lip
and the doctors say that whatever sensation does n't come back in nine months wo n't come back at all . ""
Soon South African newspaper reports surfaced claiming that there were empty bottles found in the back of the boat .
"" They wrote I was intoxicated at the time .
It was really tough for my family .
As a sportsman you are used to the ups and downs of the media but your family is not . ""
But Pistorius had more pressing concerns on his mind . ""
After worrying about whether I was going to live or not my next thought was my athletics career .
The accident has changed me .
You go through an experience like that and you can not stay the same . ""
"" I 'll slow down , "" he promises .
"" I 've sold my car that was too fast
and I have n't ridden superbikes since my accident .
I wo n't stop riding completely
but I have to look at my life
, the boat accident was n't doing anything reckless but you have to say there are aspects of my life that I can minimise taking chances on .
I have to re - evaluate . ""
After six weeks unable to train his schedule has been badly disrupted . ""
The first week I was running I had a gumguard in my mouth because my jaw was still wired .
But I 'm very lucky to still be able to make something of this year .
It has n't changed my goals , it 's going to be hard to obtain
but I 'm still going for it . ""
Finding an extra half a second in a sprint is no easy task , especially after such a serious accident ; does he really think it is possible ?
Pistorius laughs .
"" As you 've seen I 'm not bad under pressure . ""
Pistorius says he is not a natural spokesperson , that it is not his primary intention to change the way the world sees disability , but he slips easily into the role .
In terms of changing people 's perception of disability the next generation are his biggest hope .
"" Kids are really honest .
When my godson was three years old he went into a shop with his dad and saw the plastic mannequins with no feet .
He said , ' Look !
He 's got feet like Oscar 's ! '
I think that 's great .
I wish parents would be more open with their kids about disability .
Often when I 'm in shops and kids are staring I 'll go up and explain why I have prosthetic legs .
Parents are always like , ' Do n't stare ! '
but they 're stupid because they should n't make it a taboo .
If they did n't , then kids would just be like , ' Oh , there 's a guy with prosthetic legs '
or ' a guy in a wheelchair ' .
It would n't be a big deal . ""

Oscar Pistorius will compete in the BT Paralympic World Cup , for which he is an ambassador , on 24 May in Manchester ."
2009-11-04,"Prosthetics worn by disabled sprinters confer no speed advantage , scientists have found .
If anything , they may reduce the top speed a runner can achieve .
The research supports the case made by the South African Paralympic runner Oscar Pistorius , who uses flexible carbon - fibre blades in races .
Pistorius has long argued that he should be allowed to compete alongside able - bodied athletes in races , but athletics authorities banned him from doing so in last year 's Olympic games , claiming that his blades gave him an unfair advantage over able - bodied athletes .
But the new study by Alena Grabowski at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggests the authorities may have come to the wrong conclusion .
Grabowski and her colleagues examined how six elite sprinters , each with one amputated leg , ran with their prostheses .
The researchers chose sprinters with one amputation because it allowed them to compare the action of a prosthetic limb directly against a real leg .
They found that the limiting factor determining an athlete 's top speed was how hard the foot or prosthesis hit the ground .
Their study showed this "" ground force "" was around 9 % lower in the prosthetic limb versus the unaffected leg .
The results are published today in the journal Biology Letters .
Simon Choppin , a sports engineer at Sheffield Hallam University , said the Pistorius controversy rested on whether his prosthetics increased the efficiency of his limbs , allowing him to achieve higher speeds for less effort . ""
So , simply , you can move the prosthetic quicker and you 're ready for the next step faster than someone who has a leg , "" said Choppin .
Another possible advantage was that the prosthetics might allow the athlete to get back more of the energy they put into the track compared with able - bodied athletes . ""
But this [ Grabowski ] paper suggests you 're at a disadvantage if you 've got one of these blades . ""
Choppin suggested that the lower ground force was probably due to the relative lack of muscle in an amputee 's leg .
Even so , this did not mean it was inevitable that amputee sprinters would be slower runners .
To compensate for the lower ground force , Grabowski found that amputees typically moved their legs more quickly to generate the same amount of power .
The research may allow athletes such as Pistorius to take their place in elite races , said Choppin .
"" It 's hopefully good evidence that able - boded athletes will be able to compete alongside amputees such as Oscar Pistorius without that stigma that amputees are at an advantage somehow .
This evidence suggests in fact they 're not – they 're having to compensate for the lower force by running in a different way . """
2011-03-23,"As the interest around 2012 grows , I can not help but wonder how much of the build - up will take in the Paralympic Games alongside its able bodied cousin ?
Anecdotally , the main gripe about Paralympic sport seems to be a lack of understanding surrounding the complex categorisations in many events .
Or as one friend put it to me : "" I do n't get how that bloke with no legs [ Oscar Pistorius ] gets to run against a bloke with one leg . ""
Throw in a few T46 , F13 and LC2 's and the general public , along with more than a few inexpert journalists , are pretty confused .
Most of us are aware of the inspirational stories around the Paralympics , but for those who doubt the entertainment value of the sport itself you 've only to watch the men 's 100 m final at the IPC world championships this year – a thrilling race between the favourite , Pistorius , and Jerome Singleton – for a great example of how brilliant it can be .
But though demand for tickets to watch the athletics at the Olympic Games is likely to be through the roof , will it be the same story just a few weeks later at the Paralympic Games ?
Probably not .
I would suggest that a large part of that may simply be down to 2012 fatigue .
How long will it be before organisers seriously consider staging the Paralympic Games ahead of the Olympic Games ?
For a first peek inside the venues , surely a much larger crowd would be drawn to watch Paralympic sport – and many may find themselves enlightened and converted .
Meanwhile , with the British Olympic Association currently wrangling over how much profit it can cream out of 2012 – more if it extracts profits post Olympic Games , before the start of the Paralympic Games – what kind of message is being sent out , albeit inadvertently , to disabled sport and disabled people in the UK ?
While we debate the profile of the Paralympics , let 's not forget the wider issues around disability and sport that are in danger of being overlooked .
We 've been bombarded with information on the "" legacy "" of 2012 , but what kind of legacy will there be for the disabled population of this country ?
Already severely under represented on TV , in government and industry , the Paralympics provide the biggest opportunity for increasing disability awareness in history , but will it have a chance to make a difference ?
Interactive , a London - based organisation that works to improve disability equality in sport in the capital , claim the shocking statistic that of 1.5million disabled Londoners , a whopping 78 % are inactive .
Inclusive Fitness London is working towards achieving a disabled user - friendly kitemark standard for gyms and leisure facilities in all of the London boroughs – currently 52 are accredited , with 34 pending .
But with over 1,000 fitness and sports facilities in London available to 6.2million able - bodied Londoners , the numbers just do n't square if you 're disabled .
And it 's not just those wanting to take part in the action who are facing barriers .
Disabled football fans have been fighting for years for better access to grounds .
While areas for wheelchair supporters are a familiar sight at most Premier League grounds these days , scratch the surface and a myriad of problems can be found .
At Old Trafford – a 2012 venue - access for wheelchair fans operates on a rota system during the season , with demand outweighing availability by 4:1 for some fixtures , while at Stamford Bridge there is room for only three away fans in the wheelchair section .
Disabled supporters want to be treated like any other and yet at many clubs home and away fans suffer the indignity of being sat together as though they are one group .
While there are positive examples – Arsenal 's Emirates Stadium and Wembley boast 0.34 % wheelchair seating – football is badly lagging behind national recommendations for disabled facilities .
One bright piece of news is that the newly built 2012 sporting venues are leading the way for disabled access , providing almost three times the Wembley model of access with 1 % seating for wheelchair spectators .
But that a large part of the discussion – and statistics available – remains centred on wheelchair accessibility merely underlines yet another problem in the disability debate as only 3 - 5 % of disabled Londoners are wheelchair users , a tiny proportion .
There is such a long road to be travelled before disability sport and disabled people wanting to lead active lifestyles are treated like their able - bodied counterparts .
If 2012 is to have a legacy , this should be the most precious of all ."
2011-07-20,"Oscar Pistorius is fast turning out to be one of those iconic figures who , in generations to come , may be read about in school textbooks and revered as a pioneer of the 21st century .
The double amputee athlete has repeatedly refused to be categorised – disabled , able - bodied , Olympic , Paralympic – always insisting that he is simply an athlete .
For anyone who was unsure , the 24-year - old South African has proved it .
On Tuesday night in Lignano , Italy , Pistorius finally ran the A - standard qualifying time for this year 's world championships and next year 's Olympic Games , leaving the field trailing as he won the 400 metres in a new personal best of 45.07sec .
The time is remarkable – good enough for fifth at the Beijing Games and fourth at the Berlin world championships in 2009 – it is 0.18 inside the A - standard time .
No able - bodied British runner has posted a time anywhere near that this season .
Running on blades , having undergone a double amputation as a six - month - old baby , Pistorius is unique .
Not because he runs as a double leg amputee but because of his has a refreshing outlook on the world .
As a child he played rugby and water polo against able - bodied kids , and as an adult he could not see why things should be any different .
Pistorius breezily blurs the line between disabled and able - bodied .
He has a reputation as something of a wildchild ; with a penchant for driving fast cars and dirtbikes he defies conventional ideas about disability .
The first time I ever interviewed Pistorius , back in 2009 , his 400 m personal best was two seconds slower than it is today .
He seemed a long way off achieving his Olympic goal , and yet there was something compelling about him that urged you not to bet against him .
That afternoon I was struck by the way he nimbly gambolled about , fetching coffees and rearranging furniture .
Perhaps that says much about my own limited experiences of disability , but there was – and is – something undeniably powerful about having such a figure in the spotlight .
Not everyone , though , has warmed to his cause .
In March 2007 the International Association of Athletics Federations amended its rule book to state that prosthetic legs gave amputee athletes an unfair advantage over able - bodied runners .
The governing body claimed that this amendment was not targeted specifically at Pistorius , but he was not convinced and not impressed .
Gathering together a weird and wonderful mix of 12 biomechanists from around the world – specialising in topics as diverse as hopping patterns in kangaroos and breathing patterns in elephants –
Pistorius took his case to the court of arbitration for sport which , in May 2008 , ruled in his favour .
Despite their high - tech sounding name – Cheetah Flex - Foot carbon fibre limbs – themselves it is hard to imagine how they would perform better than a pair of fibulas .
The prosthetics are clunky , heavy , and appear almost homemade – crudely cut pieces of carbon fibre bolted on to wooden boards , the leg joints softened with bits of old grey foam .
Pistorius groans at how uncomfortable they are to wear .
Despite the victory over the IAAF ruling the years that followed have not been plain sailing .
The governing body leant on the South African Olympic Committee not to select Pistorius for the Beijing Games for "" reasons of safety "" , and , in any case , Pistorius did not make the qualifying times .
He competed in the Paralympic Games that year , winning gold medals in the 100 m , 200 m and 400 m , and setting new records .
Now he has finally achieved his ambition of running fast enough to compete at the world championships in Daegu this summer , and London 2012 – should the South African Athletics Association choose to select him .
For some Pistorius 's Olympic dreams may still seem a little pointless .
His personal best of 45.07sec ranks him only joint 15th in the world this year .
But Pistorius is under no illusions about his ambitions .
"" When people say : ' Why do you want to run in the Olympics ? ' they 're like : ' You 're not going to win , ' "" he says .
"" People who ask that question are people that do n't understand the theory of running to run your best time , they are people who run to win .
But it 's not just about winning .
If I run in the Olympics , my chances of running a personal best are very good because I 'm running against guys way stronger than me . ""
Pistoriuswants to be the best that he can .
Despite the obstacles he has forged a pathway to do so .
Along the way he has challenged how the world thinks about disability ."
2011-07-22,
2011-07-30,"Oscar Pistorius rose slowly from the starting blocks , like a middle - aged man with a dodgy back getting out of an armchair .
As the athletes rounded the first bend in the 400 m event at Lignano in Italy earlier this month , he was last .
But down the back straight his powerful arms began to pump , his legs appeared to slice through the air and he maintained his speed through the final bend .
Now he was leading the race and bombing down the finishing straight .
He crossed the line and sneaked a look at the clock – 45.04 seconds , eventually rounded up to 45.07 – before bear - hugging one of the other runners and falling to the track laughing .
Pistorius , 24 , who is South African , had not broken the world record –
he was almost two seconds off Michael Johnson 's 1999 mark – but he achieved something almost as significant on that balmy evening of 19 July .
He had passed the qualifying standard that will allow him , if selected by his country , to race alongside the best able - bodied athletes at next month 's world championships and at the 2012 Olympic Games in London .
And he did n't just scrape through .
If he had run that time in the 400 m final in Beijing in 2008 , he would have finished fifth ; he would have done even better at the 2009 world championships , placing fourth .
It had been coming , but no one expected it so soon .
In January 2008 , the International Association of Athletics Federations deemed that Pistorius – who was born without either fibula , the bone that runs from behind the knee to the ankle , and whose legs were amputated mid - calf when he was 11 months old – was ineligible to compete in its events , notably the Olympics .
The concern was that his carbon - fibre prosthetics gave him a competitive advantage : made by the Icelandic company Össur , the Flex - Foot Cheetah weighs approximately half of a typical sprinter 's lower leg .
Pistorius appealed , more professors and biomechanists were engaged , and in May 2008 the Swiss - based court of arbitration for sport overturned the decision .
The "" Blade Runner "" ( alias "" the fastest man on no legs "" ) was free to compete in the Olympics after all .
The only problem was that Pistorius was running mid-47 seconds for the 400 m , a significant chunk of daylight behind the world 's best .
He consoled himself by winning three golds at the Paralympics ( 100 m , 200 m and 400 m ) , all in record time .
So while Pistorius was rolling around deliriously on a track in Italy , everyone else had a couple of minutes to make up their minds on one of the most intractable ethical conundrums in recent sporting history .
The reliably erudite Roger Black , our greatest 400 m runner , was one of the first to speak out .
No scientific consensus , he pointed out , had been reached on whether the blades provided Pistorius with a benefit and until that was clear we did not have the faintest idea whether he was "" an amazing athlete or a very good athlete with an advantage "" .
Black also placed himself in the spikes of an athlete beaten – maybe even to a medal – by Pistorius .
Would they think , perhaps even justifiably , that it was unfair ?
There was concern , too , from the Paralympic community .
Pistorius has always contended that he would like to compete at both the Olympics and the Paralympics , but some viewed the actions of the world 's most famous disabled athlete as a defection .
Tanni Grey - Thompson , who won 11 gold medals at five Paralympics , had already made her position clear .
"" I just do n't think it is about whether he has an advantage or disadvantage ; he 's just too different , "" she said .
"" I can see why he wants to go to the Olympics , for the competition , fame and the money , but I 'd like to see him get that at the Paralympics
and I think London will be able to deliver that .
"" I put Black 's concern to Great Britain 's current king of the quarter - mile , Martyn Rooney , who finished sixth in the 400 m final in Beijing .
How would he feel if he were beaten by Pistorius in London ?
"" I would n't be too bothered , "" he says .
"" I 'd be a lot angrier if , say , someone who had failed a drugs test beat me .
Oscar has not gone out of his way to cheat .
This is his situation : he needs to run with those blades .
He can modify things in ways that we ca n't , but there 's things we can do that he ca n't , so it balances out quite well .
The athletes who complain are the ones who are n't running fast enough . ""
Ade Adepitan , who competed in wheelchair basketball and now presents Channel 4 's That Paralympic Show , has more conflicted views , but feels that Pistorius could be a radical role model for disabled athletes .
"" If he gets into the final it 's going to send shock waves round the world , and if he wins a medal , wow , "" he says , with a mischievous laugh . ""
Picture a double - leg amputee on the podium at the Olympics .
What doors would it open up ?
What implications does it have ?
None of us will know until it happens , but that 's the great thing about what Oscar is doing : he 's asking questions .
"" What everyone does agree on is that you would be hard pushed to find a nicer guy or better ambassador for his sport .
Pistorius is known for telling children that his legs were bitten off by a big shark , or that they fell off because he did n't eat his greens – depending on whether their parents are around – and he believes it is his responsibility to educate people positively about disability .
He is heavily involved in the Mineseeker Foundation , which supplies prosthetic limbs to the victims of landmines in Mozambique .
Pistorius was born in 1986 in Johannesburg to Sheila and Henke , who works in dolomite mining .
After the amputation , Oscar was given a set of fibreglass legs and within six months he was taking his first faltering steps .
He was a natural sportsman , playing rugby , tennis and water polo to a high level , but life away from games was less happy .
His parents split when he was six and , when he was 15 , his mother , to whom he was particularly close , died .
He only started running in 2004 , aged 17 , but within a few months , using a set of prosthetics from Össur , he was narrowly defeated in the 100 m and won the 200 m at the Athens Paralympics .
His progress has never been exactly straightforward though .
There remains considerable scientific doubt over whether his crescent - shaped legs give him an unfair advantage ; one report , in the Journal of Applied Physiology in 2009 , claimed that the Cheetahs might provide him with as much as a 10-second boost over 400 m .
The legs have also caused him to be detained and handcuffed at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam in 2008 , when police suspected him of being a terrorist .
Worst of all , he was involved in a boat accident on the Vaal river in South Africa in 2009 that left him with a broken jaw , crushed cheekbone and 170 stitches patching his face together .
It was this last incident , however , that may be responsible for Pistorius 's recent dramatic upturn in form .
Having been convinced he was going to die , he now decided to lose weight , spend less time on his Yamaha superbike and not be "" that crazy kid
I was when I was growing up "" ( though he has kept the pair of pet white tigers named after underworld gods ) .
He focused more than ever on his preparation .
"" I train harder than other guys , eat better , sleep better and wake up thinking about athletics , "" he has said .
"" That 's probably why I 'm a bit of an exception . ""
Rooney , who has raced and beaten Pistorius twice , most recently this month , agrees that there has been a dramatic change .
"" I was taking the mick out of him the other day .
A picture came up on his computer from Beijing
and I said , ' You were a fat git back then ' , "" Rooney says .
"" He was a big lad , he did n't look like an athlete and that 's when people got annoyed with the blades because they just saw this fat guy who was running fast .
But now he 's lean , he 's built like an athlete .
He 's come a long way
and he 's coming to his peak . ""
Last week a billboard went up in Times Square , New York .
It is for a new fragrance called A*Men from Thierry Mugler and shows a kind of Robo - Pistorius , his blades cast in chrome , looking like a superhero running to answer an emergency call – obviously someone needs a quick slap of aftershave , fast .
The tagline reads : "" A modern hero , an exceptional athlete .
"" It is hard to argue with either of those statements .
Whatever you think about the ethics of Pistorius racing against able - bodied athletes , it sends out a stunning message of hope for people with disabilities .
"" If you asked any sporting expert 15 years ago if Paralympians would be competing against Olympians , they would have laughed you out of the room , "" says Adepitan .
"" Oscar is inspiring amputees all over the world to say : ' Look , you can compete on an even level with anyone if you work hard enough . '
And , for any sports fan , it 's something you would want to see . """
2011-08-24,"People call Oscar Pistorius all kinds of things : disabled , differently abled , an inspiration , an egotist , even a cheat .
One label they never give him is the one he wants most of all : a runner , just like any other .
At the World Athletics Championships in Daegu , Pistorius will take his place on the blocks for the heats of the 400 m .
There will be 45 men in the field , some tall , some short , some squat , some slender , some from the first world , some from the third .
And yet Pistorius is the one who will be singled out as "" different "" , physically and athletically .
Whatever transpires when he takes to the track Pistorius must hope that this event scotches some of the myths that surround him .
He is sick of restating his case , particularly since the night of 19 July when he ran 45.07sec over 400 m , making him the 18th fastest man over one lap of track this year .
It gave him the "" A "" qualifying standard for the world championships and meant that , all of a sudden , some people saw him not as "" disabled "" but "" too - abled "" because of the blades he wears .
As Roger Black has said : "" The faster he runs , the more people are going to say that he has an advantage and we are not on a level playing field .
"" It is worth stepping back and reconsidering the role technology plays in enabling athletes .
Since Mo Farah began training with Alberto Salazar at the start of this year , he has had access to , among other things , an anti - gravity treadmill , an underwater treadmill and a cryosauna .
Farah is in the best form of his life .
Try telling Farah 's rivals from , for instance , Eritrea and Uganda , that they are on "" a level playing field "" when they toe the start - line .
Pistorius is not the first athlete to face these issues .
Aimee Mullins , a double - amputee below the knee , was competing as a sprinter at national college level in the USA as long ago as 1995 .
She wore an early version of the Cheetah flex - foot which Pistorius uses today .
In 2012 she will be the chef de mission for the US Paralympic team .
She believes the criticism of Pistorius stems from a deeply ingrained prejudice : "" If we allow a person , one who we view as our inferior , in whatever way , to play with us , and then that person beats us , what does that say about us ? ""
The British 400 m runner Martyn Rooney has a simpler way of expressing a similar view : "" It is the people who are worried about being beaten by him who are the ones who complain .
If they 're not running quick enough they 're worried .
If you 're running quick enough you should n't have to worry .
"" There are two major misconceptions about Pistorius that need to be corrected .
First , the Cheetah flex - foot blades he is running on have not changed in seven years .
The 0.54sec improvement he recorded in his personal best in Rome this July owed everything to the changes he made above the knee , and nothing to changes below it , because there were none .
Since he was involved in a serious boating accident in 2009 , Pistorius has lived , trained and prepared like an elite athlete .
The second misconception is the idea that it is now open - season for the use of prosthetic technology in "" able - bodied "" athletics .
The court of arbitration for sport ruling that overturned the International Association of Athletics Federations ' original ban on Pistorius in 2007 was specific on this point : "" This ruling does not grant a blanket licence …
[ it ] has no application to the eligibility of any other amputee athletes , or to any other model of prosthetic limb ; and it is the IAAF 's responsibility to review the circumstances on a case - by - case basis . ""
According to the ruling Pistorius would not even be able to use "" any further development "" of the Cheetah without undergoing more testing by the IAAF .
Those tests would have to examine whether future prosthetics contravened the same rule that the IAAF originally decided prevented Pistorius from competing .
It was introduced at the exact time when Pistorius was first being invited to run in meetings against non - amputee athletes , and forbids the "" use of any technical device that incorporates springs , wheels , or any other element that provides the user with an advantage over another athlete not using such a device "" .
As Pistorius 's lawyers showed , unravelling the implications of this rule is not easy .
CAS described it as "" a masterpiece of ambiguity "" .
What constitutes a "" technical device "" ?
Is n't every non - brittle object a form of spring in the sense that it has elasticity ?
And , most crucially of all , what is the specific meaning of "" advantage "" ?
In 2008 , CAS decided that the IAAF had prejudged Pistorius 's case , and was actively looking for evidence that he should be banned from IAAF - sanctioned events .
In the words of one IAAF mandarin at the time , "" we are looking for advantages , not disadvantages "" .
So the IAAF commissioned scientific tests on Pistorius 's performance when he was running in a straight line and after he had reached full acceleration .
It was already known that , unlike the majority of 400 m runners , Pistorius is slower over the first 200 m and gets faster over the second 200 m .
He has a strong finish .
But does that constitute a net advantage over the entire race ?
The obvious flip side is that Pistorius is slower than many competitors getting out of the blocks and accelerating around the first bend .
As Rooney says : "" The pros and cons weigh each other out .
There are things that Oscar can do that I could never do , and things I can do that he could never do .
Some people say he does n't get cramp in his calf or his achilles but there is so much extra strain on the upper part of his leg that I think it balances out .
"" Pistorius certainly uses less vertical force than most runners .
His stride is flatter and his hip - swing is faster .
This is not necessarily an advantage .
Many runners work on increasing their vertical force to improve their overall speed .
And while it is fast , Pistorius 's stride frequency is not out of the realms of that of other competitors .
But this debate has still not been settled .
Two of the scientists who worked on Pistorius 's case , Peter Weyand and Matthew Bundle , have since decided that the relative lightness of the Cheetahs is what gives him a faster hip - swing , and calculated that it amounts to a 12-second improvement in his time over 400 m .
By that logic if Pistorius 's closest contenders were on Cheetah blades they would be running 400 m in 32 seconds .
The world record stands at 43.18sec .
But that has not stopped them making headlines , not least when the South African sports scientist Dr Ross Tucker called the CAS ruling "" a farce "" .
Tucker is wrong when he suggests Pistorius 's team could tinker with the technology , but he may be right to question whether Pistorius 's blades affect his oxygen consumption , which has been calculated as 17 % lower than is typical for a 400 m runner .
Measuring oxygen consumption is the one key way of assessing how much energy an athlete has to use during a race .
If there is one clear advantage to the blades , it may lie here .
Yet this is a debate that is taking place on the fringes of our knowledge and understanding , and the burden of proof lies with the IAAF .
It has been unable to satisfy the CAS that Pistorius does have a metabolic advantage so significant that it outweighs all other considerations .
It may be more surprising to find criticism of Pistorius from within the Paralympic community .
Dame Tanni - Grey Thompson has argued that : "" If Oscar makes the Olympics then his event , the 400 m , should n't be run at the Paralympics because the Paralympics should never be a ' B ' final . ""
By running here , Grey - Thompson says , Pistorius risks undermining the equality that the Paralympic movement has worked to gain .
But others , Mullins among them , would argue that the world championships will mark the point when the barriers that exist in the public imagination between what it means to be "" able "" and "" disabled "" , Olympian and Paralympian , begin to be broken down for good .
Pistorius , a natural - born athlete , also happens to be at the vanguard of evolution of amputee athletics .
In the nine years between 2001 and 2010 , 967 American servicemen and women lost at least one limb in the line of duty .
Research into prosthetic limb technology has never been so well - resourced , or so advanced .
Within his lifetime prosthetic limbs will improve until they surpass the athletic performance of their natural equivalents , then the "" disabled "" may be faster than the "" abled "" .
For the IAAF and the athletics community that , as the CAS has said , is "" one of the challenges of 21st century life "" .

This article was amended on 25 August 2011 .
The original said that Peter Weyand and Matthew Bundle 's paper has not yet been peer reviewed .
That is not the case , and the reference has been removed ."
2011-08-26,"The forecast for tomorrow in the South Korean city of Daegu is for a fine and dry day , which will please Oscar Pistorius more than any of the other athletes competing in the first weekend of the world athletics championships .
An average August in Daegu sees nine inches ( 23 cm ) of rainfall , which would not suit the South African 400 m runner as he becomes the first athlete to compete for a world title on the track using artificial legs .
The curved carbon - fibre blades on which the 24-year - old runs do not take kindly to a wet track .
Pistorius learned on Friday that he will be allowed to represent his country in the 4x400 m relay as long as he and his blades are restricted to the first of the four legs , when the competitors are still running in separate lanes before converging to fight it out for track space . ""
This person is a special case , "" Lamine Diack , the president of the IAAF , the sport 's world governing body , said .
"" If he wants to run in the relay , he must run the first leg in order to avoid danger to other athletes . ""
Pistorius , who was born without a fibula in either leg and had both limbs amputated just before his first birthday , has been giving the IAAF headaches since 2008 .
That was the year in which , after extensive biomechanical tests , they banned him from competing against able - bodied athletes , only for the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne to overturn the ruling a few months later .
Pistorius failed to qualify for the Beijing Olympics , but in Italy last month , needing a time of 45.25sec to qualify for this year 's world championships , he ran 45.07sec .
It was the 18th best time of the season , more than half a second faster than his personal best , and he will line up in Sunday 's heats .
The 100 m world record - holder Usain Bolt and Britain 's world heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis will be among those in South Korea over the next week , but Pistorius is one of two South African athletes who will make the Daegu stadium the focal point of debates that go far beyond assessments of mere athletic prowess and into questions of human potential and gender differentiation .
The other is Caster Semenya , the 800 m runner who turned up in Berlin two years ago and , aged 18 , destroyed her rivals in a final that took place a few hours after the media got wind of the IAAF 's decision to subject her to a gender test .
The next thing to be destroyed was a year of Semenya 's career .
Both athletes have forced the IAAF to modify their regulations .
Pistorius 's appearance led them to prohibit the use of "" any technical device that incorporates springs , wheels , or any other element that provides a user with an advantage over another athlete not using such a device "" .
Earlier this year , six months after lifting Semenya 's suspension , they approved new regulations concerning hyperandrogenism , the condition in which women experience an overproduction of male sex hormones .
As a result , a woman athlete is now eligible to compete if her level of the hormone controlling the development of male sexual characteristics is below the "" male range "" .
The two South Africans run in the same colours and were born during the final years of apartheid , but their backgrounds could hardly be more different .
Pistorius was born in Sandton , then one of Johannesburg 's most exclusive white suburbs .
Semenya was born in Ga - Masehlong , a village in the northern province of Limpopo , where she grew up barefoot running on dirt roads .
Semenya 's appearance brought sharp remarks from her beaten rivals in Berlin .
"" She is a man , "" said Elisa Cusma , the Italian who finished sixth , prompting a response from the winner 's father :
"" She 's my little girl .
"" The controversy evoked a particular set of memories : of Stella Walsh , who won the 100 m at the 1932 Olympics and was proved at an 1980 autopsy to have been a man all along ; of Irina and Tamara Press , the heavy - duty Ukrainian sisters who mopped up gold medals in shot putt , discus , hurdles and pentathlon in 1960 and 1964 , only to vanish when chromosome testing was instituted ; and of Jarmila Kratochvilova , the burly Bohemian whose 400 m world record still stands , after 28 years .
The results of the tests on Semenya in 2009 have never been released , and her relatively modest performances since returning to competition a year ago gave birth to rumours that she has been undergoing treatment to rebalance her hormones and bring her within the IAAF 's new parameters .
The case of Pistorius is more clear - cut but just as complicated , and there are no precedents .
Is there a trade - off between the handicap of a slower rise from the starting blocks and the tireless nature of carbon - fibre , which does not experience fatigue like human muscles and means that he will be the only runner not slowing down as he nears the finish ?
And what about technological progress ?
The company that makes the blades says that they have not been modified since he started using them – but another company , working on behalf of another athlete , might one day produce devices offering a greater advantage . ""
Having Oscar Pistorius excelling is a very good thing for the kids to be watching , "" Sebastian Coe said yesterday .
But many able - bodied athletes who would normally applaud Pistorius 's courage and ability might not feel quite so generous were he to deprive them of a medal , just as another success for Semenya would reawaken a sense of injustice among some of her rivals .
Those without such a vested interest might feel that just as sport was an agent of social change when it played a role in ending apartheid , so this pair of athletes , by placing question marks against previously accepted boundaries , are pointing the way to a less prescriptive future for the human race ."

2011-08-28,"There were two men with a point to prove in the heats of the 400 m , and each , in their own way , did it in style .
Oscar Pistorius and LaShawn Merritt both qualified for the semi - finals .
After all the hype and hoopla of the buildup , Pistorius ran well to finish third in his heat , in a time of 45.39sec .
That made him the 14th fastest qualifier for Monday 's semi - finals .
As is his style , Pistorius , running in the outside lane , started slowly and kicked on strongly around the second bend .
Coming into the home straight he had a share of the lead .
He was passed by his great friend , the British runner Martyn Rooney , and the Bahamian Chris Brown in the final 50 metres , but held off everyone else .
Merritt , the world and Olympic champion , was competing in only his second race after finishing a 21-month doping suspension for inadvertently ingesting steroids contained in a penis - enlargement product .
He finished in an astonishing time of 44.35sec .
It was the quickest 400 m in the world this year , and the fastest anyone has ever run a 400 m heat in the history of both the Olympics and the World Championships . ""
Remember me ? ""
Merritt seemed to be saying to the world .
"" I 'm back . ""
No one in the field has ever run as fast as Merritt just has , so if he can replicate that kind of performance in the next two rounds , the gold will be his .
Pistorius on the other hand , will do well to make the final . ""
He has a great heart , "" Merritt said of Pistorius after his race .
"" I wish all the best to him . ""
After he crossed the line , Pistorius high - fived Rooney , hugged a few of his fellow runners and gave an appreciative bow to the crowd .
"" I have worked extremely hard to be here , "" Pistorius said .
"" It has been phenomenal to run .
It has been a lot of pressure in the race , and there is a lot of work for tomorrow . ""
He is not wrong about the pressure .
Only Usain Bolt has been in more demand from the press and public in the last few days .
The track must seem like something of a sanctuary for him ."
2011-08-29,"It took Oscar Pistorius over an hour and a half to walk from the finish line back to the changing rooms .
He has made many firsts this week and here was another .
It is surely safe to say that never before has there been so much media attention on a man who finished last in his semi - final .
Pistorius , being the person he is – some would say it was his ego , others simply that he is gracious – stopped to speak to every single TV crew and journalist along the way .
He even shook hands with most of them .
Pistorius never expected to get beyond the semi - finals .
"" I 'm a realist , for me to make the final I was n't running close to those times
and I never have , "" he said .
"" I think even if I had run faster tonight I would n't have made the final , it would have taken a miracle for that to happen . ""
But it would be patronising in the extreme to say , as he did , that the time he ran was anything other than a disappointment .
He finished in 46.19sec , more than a second outside his best .
But then he was under unique pressures .
Other than Usain Bolt , nobody in Daegu has been more in demand or subjected to greater scrutiny .
There are still people who believe the 24-year - old should not have been competing here at all , that his Cheetah flex - foot blades give him an unfair advantage .
He said , rightly , that his performance was about more than proving them wrong . ""
I believe I will always have my critics .
My job is not to silence them .
I havedone all the tests that I need to do .
The critics will always be there , unfortunately ; there are a lot of ill - informed people out there .
My job is just to train as hard as I can . ""
But Pistorius did take the opportunity to try to put a few of those "" ill - informed people "" right .
"" There have been no advances to the technology I use .
I have n't even changed a bolt on my leg in the last seven years .
This exact prosthetic foot has been out since 1996 and there is no other Paralympic athlete even running close to the times I am running , without sounding arrogant . ""
He did not need to worry about that .
Pistorius came across as being very humble – as he should be , given the time he ran .
He also knows that he risks alienating the Paralympic community , some of whom feel his presence here devalues their competition .
He sidestepped a trap laid by one journalist , who wanted to know if this was the biggest moment of his career .
"" I am a proud Paralympic athlete .
In the Beijing Games I walked away with three gold medals and a world record and that for me is still my biggest career highlight to date .
I am only one Paralympian , there are many others who deserve better than I do .
"" The South African coach will decide today whether Pistorius will run in the 4x400 m relay .
Seeing as he is their fastest runner around one - lap he will surely make the team .
But things may be complicated by the curious comment Lamine Diack , president of the International Association of Athletics Federations , made last week .
Diack said the body would insist that Pistorius runs the opening leg for South Africa in the relay , presumably to avoid the possibility of an accident in the change - over .
Pistorius has praised the IAAF
but this is exactly the kind of thinking he is trying to counter .
If he competes , he must be treated as an athlete like any other .
"" I have challenged a lot of people in the way they think about disability , "" he said after his semi .
Diack 's comment suggests Pistorius needs to challenge the IAAF 's thinking even more than healready has ."
2012-02-08,"It 's a big year for Oscar Pistorius , who is aiming to become the first amputee sprinter to compete in an Olympic Games this summer .
Last year he won an IAAF World Championships track medal thanks to his role in the South African silver - medal winning 4×400-metre relay team in South Korea , and is now attempting to qualify for the South African Olympic team for 2012 , as well as participating in this summer 's Paralympic Games .
Known for his carbon - fibre blades that have earned him the nickname "" Blade Runner "" , Pistorius was cleared by the Court of Arbitration for Sport to run in International Association of Athletics Federations events - including the Olympics - in May 2008 .
Having fought his way back from a boat accident in 2009 that left him with serious injuries , he is a keen ambassador for his sport and seen widely as a role model for disabled athletes .
He 'll be joining us between 12 pm and 1 pm GMT on Thursday 9th February .

2012-02-09,"Oscar Pistorius will be joining us here at Guardian sport for a webchat this lunchtime .
Famous for his carbon - fibre blades , Oscar is aiming to become the first amputee sprinter to compete in an Olympic Games at London 2012 this summer .
Last year he won an IAAF World Championships track medal thanks to his role in the South African silver - medal winning 4×400-metre relay team in South Korea , and is now attempting to qualify for the South African Olympic team for 2012 , as well as participating in this summer 's Paralympic Games .
He 'll be appearing below the line to answer your questions from 12 pm GMT .
Here is a selection of some of the questions that you have already asked on yesterday 's preview blog : jameswilliamjacobs2 asked :
Hi Oscar - i think your a real inspiration to folks .
You 're perhaps the most famous person with a disability in sport .
Do you feel that you are an ' ambassador ' for disabled people ( like me - I have asperger 's syndrome ) , or do you believe that your disability should n't define who you are ?
llamapaca asked : Is the composition of the track material significant for you , i.e. do you perform better on a grippy / less - grippy track ?
JessicaCop asked : What would your alternative career be , if you were n't a runner ?
What would be your dream prosthesis
and/or do your ever feel frustrations with regards to the progress in their development ?
Does London2012 somehow feel different to previous competitions ?
Do you ever get frustrated by the focus on your blades ?
Gutted to be missing you at the Games !
Rob30 asked : First of all , I 'd just like to say that I admire the uncompromising approach that guys like you and Richard Whitehead bring to your disciplines .
What you do is undoubtedly worth shouting about .
Just interested to know ... again , with regard to Richard ... he 's shown it 's possible to move from endurance running to sprint .
Has it ever appealed to you to do the same ( or , rather , the reverse ) ?
How did it feel to be told by the IAAF that your prosthetics were "" an advantage "" ?
Does something like anger you ?
Sadden you ?
Inspire you to push harder ?
RalfyJ asked : Do you fear that , if you were to start winning medals or breaking records , you would be judged ineligible to compete at the Olympics ?
That is , do you think that you are only allowed to compete on the unstated understanding from your competitors and the sport 's administrators that you wo n't win ?
holidayswithPoirot
asked : I reckon that yourself and Usain Bolt are the two most famous athletes in the world .
What are the best and worst consequences of this ?
peregrine25 asked : Hi Oscar , 2 questions : will you continue after London 2012 and aim for Rio ?
Also , have you learned any Italian whilst basing yourself there ? !
JHouse18 asked :
Hi Oscar .
I read that you 're into cars and horse racing .
Is it important that you have interests away from your running , and your general career as an athlete , so that you can zone out and take any pressure off yourself ?
Ross22 asked : Do you feel the effects of lactic acid in your hamstrings , glutes ?
If so do you do anything to try and lessen this effect , ph neutral diet etc ?
Your core must be very strong , any insight into how you 've achieved this please ?
philwest asked :
My question is this : Your 100 m and 200 m times are ordinary compared to able - bodied athletes because you can not explode out of the blocks .
Your 400 m times are excellent thanks to ( as mentioned by someone earlier ) your running the second 200 m faster than the first .
Have you ever competed over 800 m ( Difficult , I know , as the IAAF only wants you to race in lanes ) or ever experimented to see what times you could do at this distance ?
Surely this would shed some light on the scientific arguments about the blades giving an advantage or not .
All the best !
MZedda asked : I ask to the London 2012 advertisers : "" Why does Oscar 's impairment or disability have to be separated from his record in order for people to admire him "" ?
I feel that it 's important not to separate disability from ability and that you have achieved fantastic records because you are who you are : tenacious , hardworking , competitive and happen to have a double leg amputation .
I think it 's important for others with an impairment to see that they should not be ashamed of their disability and that they should be praised or admired as whole persons - impairment included .
Oscar : what do you think ?
Looking forward to see you at the Paralympic games !
definitelynotashark asked : Ok , my question .
Top 5 tunes to run to ?
thomas84 asked : I 've noticed on Twitter that you 've tweeted rugby players and seem to follow the sport .
As the six nations is on i d like to know who do you think stands the best chance of winning .
Also , have you ever played rugby ?

2012-05-09,
2012-05-24,"It was an awkward moment .
Oscar Pistorius sat at a press conference table next to his fellow 400 m runner LaShawn Merritt who – just days ago – had urged the International Association of Athletics Federations to keep a close eye on the issue of prosthetic limbs in able - bodied competition .
While the South African double amputee , who looks set to become the first Paralympic athlete to compete at the Olympic Games this summer , defended his position for the umpteenth time since winning his court case against the IAAF in 2008 , Merritt squirmed .
The American insisted he has the "" utmost respect "" for Pistorius , but in truth the defending Olympic champion has been vehemently outspoken about the Paralympian whom he will be lining up against at the Golden Spike meeting in Ostrava on Friday night .
Merritt , who served a 21‑month ban after testing positive for steroids in 2009 , had told reporters that he was concerned about the use of technology as a performance - enhancing aid in his sport – an issue that continues to be debated among sports scientists . ""
The prosthetic legs I 'm using , the cheetah , have been around since 1996 and I 've had the exact same model , same shape since 2004 and nothing 's changed on it , "" said Pistorius .
"" I 'm not looking to increase my times or performances from any application or apparatus , it 's all in my training and my recovery , my diet and sacrifices
I make on and off the track that make my performances better .
So the exact same leg I use now is the one I used before and there are very strict rules to implement [ any changes ] and anyway , I 'm not looking to obtain any advantages through it . ""
Asked if he ever worried that fellow athletes may have some reservations over his inclusion at able - bodied competitions , Pistorius seemed oblivious to Merritt 's recent comments , insisting that he has the respect of his peers .
"" I have a lot of respect for the guys I 'm running against and I have a good relationship with them , some of the guys have come to my house in South Africa for off - season training .
"" Part of the testing was a good thing because I think there would have been questions that were asked [ by athletes ] , but by me doing the tests any athletes who were worried before we did the tests , most of the critics were put to rest after that .
That 's probably one of the biggest things for me if my competitors were to have had a problem with me –
but after we 'd done the tests I guess it was comforting for myself and it was comforting for them as well . """
2012-06-29,"The Olympic Games has lost one of its biggest names .
Oscar Pistorius , the double amputee from South Africa , has failed to make the South African 400 m team .
Pistorius has spent the past few weeks travelling the world , across Europe , the USA and Africa , trying to run an "" A "" standard of 45.30sec .
He had his last chance at the African championships in Benin on Friday , but he could only clock 45.52sec .
That was good enough to win him a silver medal , but not to fulfil the selectors ' stringent criteria .
Pistorius could still make the South African 4x400 m relay team , but even that can not be taken for granted .
He was controversially dropped from the quartet after he helped them to set a national record in the heats of the 2011 world championships , and he has suggested that certain figures within the administration hold a grudge against him .
Pistorius holds one "" A "" standard , set in a domestic competition , but the selectors stipulated that he would need to add another to make the grade .
The Games will be poorer for his absence .
He was gracious about his failure to qualify , saying : "" I had felt very strong coming into this competition as my fitness and speed has been continually improving .
I was in good shape to set the time and believe my speed will only increase over the next few weeks . ""
He still has three titles to defend at the Paralympics , and he says they will now be his "" big focus "" , along with the relay ."
2012-07-05,"Oscar Pistorius made history as an Olympian today , three weeks before the London 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony .
He made history because as a Paralympian running with prosthetic carbon fibre limbs , he beat able - bodied competitors to a place in the South African 4x400 metres relay team .
As being overtaken in the egg and spoon race has taught many a four - year - old , in sport , it 's rarely the taking part that counts .
Athletes are winners , or at least they aim to be .
Any sprinter grinning at fourth place is missing the point .
Pistorius will be no different .
No one gets to be world class at anything without a cut - throat drive to be the best .
This drive is arguably even more intense in someone whose legs have been amputated before his first birthday .
But it 's not really patronising to say that this case is an exceptional one : it is , at least partly , about the taking part .
Pistorius will rightly want a gold medal , not a "" well done for trying "" medal and Kate Middleton patting him on the head .
But there 's an undoubted achievement simply in the inclusion of a disabled person in the Olympic competition .
For most people with disabilities , inclusion is the shiny medal they spend their lives fighting for but which stays slightly out of reach .
This is n't new .
It 's the nature of being different .
It is worsening though , and in the current climate , without radical change , there is little hope of it getting better .
It should n't be that difficult , should it ?
For a person to be included ?
Sometimes it seems difference is a crime for which disabled people are punished daily .
One aspect of this will feature on the route to the Games themselves –
Paralympians being welcomed to a city whose transport system is usually inaccessible to them .
Exclusion is sneaky though , it does n't even need to be literal .
Thanks to David Cameron and friends , disabled people are facing not only physical barriers but growing symbolic exclusion .
This is what a climate of fear does – a climate that does n't simply emerge from tough economic times but needs to be manipulated and nurtured .
It 's manipulated by a government that thinks welfare reform means arbitrarily removing vulnerable people 's benefits .
It 's nurtured by a rightwing populist press eager for benefits - cheats scapegoats and scaremongering .
This is a climate in which a website needs to be created to collate the number of people committing suicide as a result of the government 's policies .
Calum 's List details the deaths of people where either professional or family testimony , or a suicide note cites welfare reform as the main reason for their taking their own life .
A climate in which the number of disability hate crimes reported to the police has reached a record high .
A total of 1,942 were recorded by forces in England , Wales and Northern Ireland last year – a 14 % increase on those for 2010.When Pistorius , the "" Blade Runner "" , comes to the Olympics , he 'll have achieved true inclusion – a disabled athlete competing on equal terms next to the able - bodied .
Inclusion though , rarely takes this form .
Pistorius is part of an elite .
For most of us , it 's just about having a job , being respected in the street , being given help if you need it to get out of the house .
It 's ordinary and everyday – and that 's part of its beauty .
As the crowds cheer , the people of this country would do well to think on that sentiment .
A disabled person should n't have to be "" super - able "" to be included .
Having been allowed to join the mainstream , Pistorius can strive to rise above it .
For the ordinary disabled person , it would be nice to be allowed to take part .

2012-07-10,"David Weir , the Beijing double gold medallist , has been named in the 49-strong British athletics team for the London Paralympics .
Several of the 28 athletes who make their Games debuts in London are world - record holders including Hannah Cockroft , the T34 double world champion in the 100 m and 200 m , Paul Blake , the world - record holder in the T36 1500 m and world 400 m champion , and Jonnie Peacock , the T44 100m - record holder after clocking 10.85secs to break Oscar Pistorius 's record at the end of June .
Josie Pearson and Richard Whitehead are named in the athletics squad after representing Britain in Beijing in wheelchair rugby and in Turin 2006 in ice sledge hockey respectively .
Stephen Miller , a three - time Paralympic gold medallist in the F32 club throw , and Dan West , a multiple medallist in the F34 shot putt and discus , have been selected for their fifth Games this summer , and Tracey Hinton , a double gold medallist in the T11 100 m and 200 m at the recent European Championships , celebrates her sixth Paralympic Games .
Weir , the gold medallist in the T54 800 m and 1500 m in Beijing who will be taking part in his fourth Games , said : "" I definitely felt the pressure going into Beijing four years ago but I 've grown as an athlete since then
and I think I proved that to an extent with my gold medals at the World Championships in New Zealand last January . ""
Peter Eriksson , the UKA head coach , said : "" We 've made a lot of changes since Beijing where we finished 18th overall and that medal performance has been our benchmark for progress ever since .
"" We had a hugely successful World Championships in January 2011 where we won 38 medals and finished third in the medal table . ""
Now , in my third full year at UKA , we 're starting to see the gradual transition to a much more professional squad with a fantastic team spirit as well as having competent performers .
Overall the strength and depth of the squad has improved and that 's a huge positive .
"" I 'm confident we can do well
and but we ca n't underestimate the fact that every other nation will have stepped up their preparation and performance goals in this quickly evolving and fast - improving sport . """
2012-07-16,"The double amputee Oscar Pistorius , who has qualified to run the 400 m at the London Olympics , has hit out at critics of his participation in the Games and the scientists whose opinions fuel a debate which he believes should have ended in 2008 , when three judges at the court of arbitration for sport unanimously decided that his current prostheses did not offer him a competitive advantage over able - bodied athletes .
"" Some of the arguments are so weak and it does make me a bit frustrated , "" the South African said .
"" It 's something I dealt with .
I had nothing to hide and in 2008 I said , ' Come , let 's do the proper testing . '
And you still get people who go for a certain angle because they want to keep it a controversial story .
What irritates me is when I read something and the facts are n't there .
They make it sound like I 'm the only guy running on this prosthetic leg , when in fact they 've been made since 1996 and tens of thousands of Paralympic athletes have used the exact same leg that I 'm using , and many are using an updated version of the ones I 'm using .
If this prosthetic leg is such an advantage then why is it that not one other Paralympic athlete has broken 50 seconds on the 400 , let alone run a 46 or a 47 seconds , using the exact same prosthetic leg ? ""
In 2009 , the year after the CAS verdict , two scientists who were involved in the research that led to that decision announced their belief that in fact Pistorius 's prostheses "" give him a clear and major advantage "" and "" enhance sprint running speeds by 15 - 30 % "" , reducing by as much as 10 seconds the time he takes to cover 400 m .
The debate has continued ever since , and will be further stoked when he makes his Olympic debut , scheduled for the morning of 4 August .
"" There 's so much information out there and so many scientists .
Just because a guy 's got a title of doctor or professor does n't mean he has any knowledge in the field , "" said Pistorius .
"" I hope that one day we 'll get over this point and people are informed and they take the time to do their research .
There will always be a scientist or a doctor who is looking for a platform and looking to make a name for himself and he 'll debate anything –
he 'll say wet is dry and green is red .
Unfortunately there are journalists that do give these guys a platform and when they 're called up they love to sing a song .
It is something that does still get me a bit down , but I 've done as much as I can do . ""
On Tuesday Pistorius returns to Lignano , the Italian town where a year ago he shattered his personal best with a time of 45.07sec which secured entry to the world championships , for his final public race before the Olympics .
In Daegu he reached the semi - finals , where he came last ( though he was quicker than two athletes in other heats ) , and he is looking for a small improvement in London .
While South Africa might compete for a medal in the 4x400 m relay , a place in the individual final looks to be beyond an athlete whose best time this season – 45.20 – has been bettered by 31 athletes ; the favourite and defending champion , LaShawn Merritt , has twice beaten it by more than a second this year .
"" I 'd like to do better than I did last year .
If that means gaining one position or two positions , that would make me very happy , "" he said .
"" I 'm not at the point yet when I can be a contender to qualify for the final , the guys are just in another league .
In the relay , if we run a smart semi - final and final we could have a chance of getting to the podium , and that would be a blessing . ""
In September Pistorius will return to London to defend his Paralympic 100 m , 200 m and 400 m titles .
He is confident of extending his unbeaten records in the two longer distances but is less confident about the 100 m , partly because of the form of the 19-year - old Briton Jonnie Peacock , who shattered the T44 ( single amputee ) world record earlier this month and against whom he must compete for gold .
"" I did n't expect that time at all , I must admit , "" he said .
"" At the BT Paralympic World Cup in May this year people were asking me about him , and I said , ' I think he 's young and he 's got a lot to learn , ' and I was horribly wrong .
Jonnie 's proved to be a lot quicker than I thought he was going to be .
Then you 've got guys like Jerome Singleton , who last year was the first athlete to beat me over 100 m in seven years .
So my work is cut out for me in the 100 m
, there 's no doubt about that .
These guys are specialists in the 100 , that 's what they train for day in , day out .
I 've only run two 100 m races in the last 18 months , but I 'm going to go out there and give it my best . """
2012-07-23,"This is the golden era of amputee sprinting , "" Jerome Singleton , the T43/44 100 m sprinter who lunged for the line with such power to pip Oscar Pistorius for the gold medal at last year 's world championships that he fell face - first on to the track , says the morning after he qualified for London 2012 at the US Paralympic trials in Indianapolis .
He speaks with authority , having finished fourth in the final at the trials behind the British prodigy Jonnie Peacock , who set a new world record with 10.85sec , but was third in the race that mattered among his compatriots and booked his place on the plane to London .
"" My winning time at the worlds would only have got sixth place at the national trials , "" he says .
"" That shows where we 're going and how competitive it 's going to be . ""
But he insists he is not worried that his status as "" the fastest amputee on the planet "" , the phrase he uses to describe himself , is under threat .
"" I really trust my coach to put me in a position where I can shine at the Games , "" he says .
"" He 's the expert at what he does
and I 'm the student , trying to learn .
Learning is my favourite thing and when I get to that race it 's going to be automatic .
My goal here was to make the top three .
I 've accomplished that .
Now I 'm heading back to the weight room and the track for two months to get ready for the races .
"" It is hardly surprising that the charming South Carolina - born sprinter identifies education as "" the best thing "" .
The 25-year - old won an academic scholarship to Atlanta 's Morehouse College , triple majoring in mathematics and applied physics , before moving on to the University of Michigan to add an industrial engineering degree to his achievements .
During his studies he earned much - coveted internships at both Nasa and Cern , the European Organisation for Nuclear Physics in Geneva .
As a Nasa scholar he was part of the team working on the oil - free turbomachinery project "" to develop an engine that could be used in the Mars landing not dependent on oil "" .
His second assignment with the space agency involved the refinement of a stereo imaging vescroscopy system to scan the eye to detect cataracts .
In Switzerland he researched high - energy particles .
"" It was a tremendous experience , "" he says .
"" The first time I left the country was for academics and now athletics has given me the chance to do the same thing .
I love sports and I love academics .
I 've been blessed twice . ""
Singleton broke his studies to compete in Beijing , winning gold as a member of the 4x100 m relay team and a silver medal behind Pistorius in the individual event .
But his rivalry with the South African does not dilute their friendship .
"" I 'm such a supporter of his .
I want to beat him but he 's like a brother .
I wish the best for him at the Olympics .
He is showcasing what a person with a physical disability can achieve .
He shows that you should never limit yourself .
Oscar keeps inspiring me . ""
"" I 'm so happy to be part of this movement , "" he says .
"" I 've been an amputee all my life
and I did n't know anything about the Paralympics until 2006 when I was 20 .
How much it has grown over the past six years is incredible .
I want it to get to the point where everyone knows it for what it is
and I 'm thankful that what y' all are doing right now in London is helping so much to take it out there in terms of awareness .
I 'm so happy y' all are going to give us so much support .
Great Britain and the community in London seem drawn to it . ""
His personal ambitions for his trip are to have fun and realise his potential but he is evangelical about the Games ' wider significance .
"" I believe when we look at somebody we should look at their ability not their disability .
We all know somebody with a disability and now we can point to the Games and ask them : ' Why are n't you seeking to become a Paralympian ? '
Look at Oscar and Rudy Garcia - Tolson – we can raise everybody 's eyes to aspire to that level . ""
His enthusiasm and pride in the movement is palpable and he wants everyone to have the same opportunity he cherishes .
""
Once a Paralympian , always a Paralympian , "" he says .
"" It 's such a blessing , man . """
2012-08-04,"It is an overused phrase , but there was one man in the Olympic Stadium who could lay claim to genuinely making history .
Oscar Pistorius , the Blade Runner , said he felt blessed after sailing through the opening round of the 400 m heats and becoming the first double amputee to compete in the Olympic Games .
The South African , who drew cheers from the crowd even as he settled into his blocks , came second in the opening heat in a season 's best time of 45.44sec , behind Santos Luguelín of the Dominican Republic .
But neither will face the reigning Olympic champion , LaShawn Merritt in the semi - finals , after the American pulled up with a hamstring injury after 100 metres in his heat .
Merritt had to win a court of arbitration for sport ruling to overturn an International Olympic Committee regulation that banned any athlete suspended for doping from the Games that followed , but limped away clutching his hamstring .
Pistorius has said many times that he considers himself the same as any other athlete but the 80,000 pairs of eyes in the Olympic Stadium were trained on only one man ahead of his race .
He accelerated into the second half of the race , before slowing at the finish as he realised he was in a position to qualify for Sunday 's semi - finals .
Afterwards , he paid tribute to the "" incredible "" support and said it was one of the highlights of his life , along with his appearance at his first Paralympic Games as a 17-year - old in Athens in 2004 .
"" I felt good today .
We work so hard every day , "" said Pistorius , who said he had fulfilled his pre - Games goal by reaching the semi - finals .
He added that he had "" waited six years "" for his chance and , competing in front of his friends and family , had found himself smiling in the starting blocks .
The four - times Paralympic gold medallist became the first double amputee to compete in the Olympic Games following a long journey that involved not only the usual punishing training regime but also a lengthy court battle against his sport 's governing body .
Other athletes have competed in both the Olympics and Paralympics before , the South African swimmer Natalie du Toit among them , but as the first to do so in track and field he has become one of the biggest stories of these Games .
South African journalists who have followed his career in exhaustive detail said he was unusually nervous ahead of his Olympic Games debut , despite having competed in last year 's world championships .
His inclusion in the South African team for the biggest stage of all , in both the 400 m and the 4x400 m relay , inevitably reignited the debate about whether his carbon fibre blades confer him any advantage .
A court of arbitration for sport decision in 2008 , overturning an earlier International Association of Athletic Federations ban , ruled that they did not but some , including Michael Johnson , have said he should not be competing in the Olympics .
"" I think often there 's a lot of debate about the advantages , but there 's not much said about the disadvantages , "" said Pistorius this week .
"" If this was such an amazing piece of equipment that 's been around for 14 years , then how come thousands of other Paralympic athletes are n't breaking world records and challenging even a 45- or a 48- or a 49-second 400 m ? ""
He also points out that he has been racing on the same set of blades for years and his times have improved through talent and dedication rather than technology .
Afterwards , his rivals insisted they did not have a problem running against him .
Kirani James of Grenada , who won the 400 m at last year 's world championships , said : "" I just see him as another competitor , another athlete .
I really respect him .
It is what it is . ""
Pistorius had his legs amputated at the age of 11 months having been born without fibulas in both .
He took up athletics after impressing with his speed during rugby training .
However , it is only since missing out on the Beijing Games that he has applied himself to a rigorous training regime and his times have improved markedly as a result .
After Saturday 's race , he paid tribute to his mother and recalled her advice : "" A loser is n't the person that gets involved and comes last , but the person who does n't get involved in the first place . ""
The Britons Nigel Levine , Conrad Williams and Martyn Rooney all qualified for the semi - finals .
Williams , who ran in Merritt 's heat , said he had to keep calm after being "" thrown a bit "" when the reigning champion pulled up .
The Belgian Jonathan Borlée was the fastest qualifier in 44.43 , just the latest of a string of national records to fall already in the Olympic Stadium ."
2012-08-16,"This summer , ogling incredible athletes ' bodies became something of a national obsession .
And , in two weeks ' time , the Paralympics means we can indulge all over again .
Except these incredible bodies are also disabled bodies , which means we 're "" marvelling "" rather than "" perving "" , right ?
Because Paralympians are symbols of triumph - over - adversity rather than sex symbols , right ?
Not that I 'm implying missing limbs ca n't be sexy .
Oh , God , this is tricky .
The potential to put your foot in your mouth when talking about disability is one reason why representations of disability are conspicuously absent from advertising billboards .
Big brands tend to play it safe with their marketing budgets .
And it seems they often find the safest way to deal with disability in their advertising is to ignore it entirely .
When you do see disability in an ad , it 's often as some sort of cautionary tale .
Drive drunk , end up legless :
cut to tearful teen in wheelchair .
Approximately 18 % of the British population can be considered disabled , but disabled bodies are largely invisible from mainstream marketing campaigns .
Meanwhile , the David Beckham brand is plastered on everything from the White Cliffs of Dover , to pants , to the Paralympics .
Indeed , the footballer is fronting a major new television campaign , launched last night , to mark Sainsbury 's sponsorship of the Paralympics .
Unless Posh can be considered a disability ( Benedict Cumberbatch would say yah ) , Beckham is n't disabled .
Nevertheless , he states he is honoured to be a Sainsbury 's Paralympic brand ambassador , and "" to help tell the stories of the athletes in the advert in preparation of the Games "" .
Really , it is rather wonderful he 's helping the Paralympians out because , you know , a prosthetic leg can really get in the way of speaking for yourself .
While Sainsbury 's emphasis on able - bodied Beckham is disappointingly conservative , its sponsorship commitment to the Paralympics is groundbreaking .
Sainsbury 's is the first ever Paralympics - only sponsor of the Games and has signed the largest sponsorship deal in Paralympic history .
Indeed , this year 's Paralympics is notable for being the most high - profile , and the most branded .
Advertising slots around the Paralympic opening ceremony are sold out and the likes of BP , P&amp;G and BT are all throwing money at the chance to associate their brands with disabled athletes .
Much of the anticipation around this year 's Paralympics can be attributed to a mammoth publicity drive by Channel 4 , which is promoting its exclusive coverage of the Games through a marketing campaign that is its biggest ever .
This was spearheaded by a "" roadblock "" premiere of its Meet the Superhumans film across 78 television channels .
If you have n't seen the 90-second film , watch it .
It 's gulp and gasp sort of stuff .
What 's more , it 's a long way away from Channel 4 's usual approach towards disability and marketing – which is gulp and gasp in complete horror at its crassness sort of stuff .
The last time Channel 4 used disabled people in a high - profile marketing push was to promote its show "" The Undateables "" .
Channel 4 's shift from positioning disabled people as "" Undateables "" to branding them "" Superhumans "" can be seen as exemplifying a wider reassessment in the marketing world around how to portray disability .
Just look at South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius , who is a double - amputee , an incredible athlete , and a bit of a hottie .
Pistorius has been roundly embraced by brands : he 's partnered with Oakely , sponsored by Nike , acts as a BT ambassador , and is the face ( and body ) of
the Thierry Mugler A*Men fragrance .
Pistorius is also the first amputee track athlete to cross the boundary into the able - bodied Olympics ; which has caused uproar from certain quarters who feel his disability actually gives him an unfair advantage .
Indeed , Pistorius 's body has become something of an uber - branded battleground over what "" disability "" actually means .
But controversy aside , one thing seems clear : he is good for business .
The fact that such a diverse range of brands are confident the "" Blade Runner "" has such mainstream appeal is tantamount to a new realisation by marketers that , hey , Paralympians sell .
Disabled athletes do n't just have to tug at your heartstrings ; they can be heart - throbs and tug at your wallet - strings .
For once , a bit of a sexual objectification in advertising may actually be a positive step ."
2012-08-18,"A race is a race .
It does n't matter if it 's the Olympics or the Paralympics .
When your diet largely consists of nuts , seeds and blended chicken an Olympic village full of fast food is not what you need .
It amazed me to see athletes who have trained their bodies for four years for this moment eating it .
That said , the two burgers I allowed myself after the final relay race were some of the best I 've tasted .
I 'd describe the Olympic beds as comfortable , light and airy .
The environment was noisy .
Not because people were having sex , as reported , but because you could always hear people coming and going .
There was no particularly amazing night 's sleep .
I will never forget the wall of noise from the crowd at this Olympics ; 70,000 people seemed like 170,000 .
It felt like final night even in the heats .
I 'll remember the sound of my name being chanted when I 'm 40 .
Deciding to try and keep up with Jonathan Borlée in the semi - final was stupid of me .
He got away so quickly it seemed like a good idea , but then it became about a chase – not running my own race .
Of course , there are athletes who are bitterly disappointed at their performances .
I am not –
I was never expected to get a gold medal at these Games –
but I know how it can feel .
The best thing you can do is take the time to grieve your performance .
I was lucky enough to be in the stadium the night David Rudisha broke the 800 m record .
It was the single best performance by an athlete I have ever seen , and he 's so down - to - earth , he trains so hard .
It was inspiring .
The British athletes were in the greatest spirits , there 's no doubt about that .
If there was a team who were buoyed by each other 's performances it was Team GB .
Chad le Clos slept with his gold medal around his neck the night he won , and wore it to breakfast .
I know because I saw him coming out of the lift the next morning
and he told me it was n't going anywhere .
There is no better place than London to hold the Paralympics .
Britain has been forward - thinking in its reaction to disabilities ever since I have been involved with the sport and will teach the world a lot at these Games .
Finally people are going to embrace Paralympic sport for what it is : hardcore performances , not our stories .
To have all the tickets sold out is mindblowing .
The Paralympics 100 m will have one of the greatest line - ups we 've ever seen : myself , Britain 's Jonnie Peacock , America 's Blake Leeper and Jerome Singleton and my fellow South African Arnu Fourie .
Any one of us has it in us to win .
I believe I 'll be at my peak in Rio .
It 's already beckoning me ."
2012-08-19,"When Oscar Pistorius kneels in the starting blocks for the Paralympic sprints next week , he may feel a sense of deja - vu .
He was here last month , too – the first amputee ever to compete with able - bodied runners in the Olympics .
"" I had cramps in my cheeks where I was smiling so much on that start line , "" remembers 25-year - old Pistorius , who still hears the roar of the crowd when he goes to sleep at night .
"" I heard this whistle , I knew that whistle , I looked up and it was my coach with my brother and sister and 89-year - old grandmother .
Seeing them , I [ remembered ] in that moment everything I had done to be there on that start line , everyone in my life who had supported me . ""
It had been some struggle to get there .
He was born without calf bones , for a start – and by the time he was a year old both his legs had been amputated below the knee .
But perhaps his biggest obstacle has been the athletics governing body – who initially would n't let the South African take part in able - bodied events .
Critics argued that the prosthetic blades he uses instead of legs gave him an unfair advantage , and – in relay races – might trip up other athletes .
Ironically , Pistorius had grown up in Pretoria playing able - bodied sport .
He played rugby , water polo and tennis at school – the latter two at regional level – and only turned to sprinting and the Paralympics after a rugby - related injury at 16 .
"" I was introduced to Ampie Louw – who is still my coach today – and over the first few weeks he saw something in me and it turned out I had a talent for running . ""
Talent is a modest way of putting it .
Nicknamed the Blade Runner , Pistorius is the pre - eminent Paralympian sprinter .
Despite failing to qualify for the Beijing Olympics , Pistorius won the 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in the Paralympics that followed , setting three world records in the process .
But this time around , he has his work cut out .
In order to make the Olympics ( he qualified this time , but did n't make the final ) , Pistorius had to focus on his best event – the 400 m – at the expense of the shorter sprints .
"" I 've lost nearly two stone since Beijing to be the best 400 m runner I can be , and I 'm not built as a 100 m sprinter any more , "" he admits .
"" It 's going to be tough for sure . "" While he 's the first sprinter to compete in both events , Pistorius wo n't be drawn on comparisons between the Olympics and Paralympics – and argues that Paralympians should be treated like any other athlete . ""
To me , a race is a race , "" he says .
"" People will admire the athletes for what they achieve , not focusing on their disability . """
2012-08-28,"The next 12 days could change the world .
That was the message offered up by the infectiously enthusiastic Oscar Pistorius ahead of the Paralympic Games opening ceremony .
Pistorius , the South African star of the Games , believes other countries will learn a lot from Britain 's enlightened approach to hosting the 2012 Paralympics .
"" The UK is definitely a country which deals with disability in a really amazing way , "" Pistorius said .
"" There are a lot of people that are going to watch these Games around the world that are going to be forced in a way to see these Paralympics through the eyes of the people of the UK .
And I think that is a great thing .
There are a lot of people here that do n't focus on the disability any more , they focus on the athletes ' ability . ""
"" I think this will be one of the most accessible Paralympics we have had , "" Pistorius added .
"" The audiences will take away a phenomenal experience , seeing inspirational sport , not focusing on the disability but focusing on the ability , and the triumphs and disappointments .
I believe this Paralympic Games is going to change many people 's perceptions not just about Paralympic sport , but about people living with disabilities .
It is going to completely change people 's mindsets .
I am just so excited to see the impact this will leave around the world . ""
Just a little over a fortnight after Pistorius , 25 , made history by becoming the first double - amputee to run in the Olympics , where he reached the semi - finals of the 400 m , he is going to be competing in four events at the Paralympics .
He will be running in the 100 m , 200 m , 400 m , and in the 4x100 m relay .
He says he will be happy just to make the podium in the 100 m , but will aim for gold medals 200 m and 400 m .
He thinks that his Olympic experience will give him a little edge over his rivals , simply because he will already have had a taste of running in front of the 80,000-strong crowd . ""
The Paras have been sold out for many weeks
and I know there will be the same passionate crowd there , so hopefully I can use that experience to my advantage for the first race or two . ""
Pistorius is an undeniably inspirational figure , partly because he does not sugar coat his words .
He admitted that there "" is still a long way to go "" in terms of transforming attitudes towards disability around the world .
But he believes these Paralympics will be a sizeable step forwards .
"" I think the UK is at the forefront when it comes to education surrounding disability .
I believe that is the only way to get over the stigmas and the feeling it is a taboo subject that a lot of people have had . """
2012-08-29,
2012-08-29,"Oscar Pistorius may have been in the spotlight this summer ahead of his appearances at the Olympic and Paralympic Games , but for the British cyclist Sarah Storey crossing the divide between so - called able - bodied and disabled sport is old news .
Storey , born with a congenital hand defect , has taken on all - comers for most of her sporting life and was selected for England at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi .
Her quest to represent Britain at both the Olympics and Paralympics this summer narrowly foundered when she missed out on a women 's team pursuit place in December last year .
But 20 years after she first swam for Britain at the 1992 Paralympics in Barcelona , one of Britain 's greatest Paralympians will on Thursday begin her quest to add to her seven gold medals .
Five of those gold medals were won in the pool , before an ear infection forced her switch to cycling in 2005 and she picked up where she left off .
The cycling pursuit C5 final , in which Storey won gold in Beijing , will be the first of four events she is targeting on the track in the velodrome ( where she will also compete in the C4 - 5 500 m ) and on the road at Brand 's Hatch ( where she will target both the road race and the time trial ) .
Storey 's husband Barney will also compete in London , as a tandem pilot for Neil Fachie .
Darren Kenny , who led the charge in Beijing with four gold medals , will also begin his campaign in a velodrome that has already cemented its place in British sporting history .
Others expected to contribute medals include the former RAF weapons technician Jon - Allan Butterworth , who recently caused disquiet among fellow athletes by suggesting some of them were competing "" for a laugh "" , and Jody Cundy – who followed Storey 's route from the pool to the track and won two gold medals in Beijing .
The gold rush that began during the Olympics is almost certain to continue at the Paralympics , where the team will face a similarly tall order to match up to their Beijing achievements .
Four years ago the sport contributed 17 gold medals to the overall ParalympicsGB total of 42 .
Anyone in any doubt at all that the Paralympics represents a pinnacle of elite sport is advised to travel to the national cycling centre in Manchester , where Storey and Kenny have trained for these Games alongside Sir Chris Hoy and Laura Trott .
Although the Paralympic athletes have their own coaches and their own performance director in Gareth Sheppard , they avail themselves of the same sports science , and technical and kit advances as their Olympic counterparts .
Their coaches sit side by side in the same offices and the all pervasive "" aggregation of marginal gains "" culture that has defined the British Cycling revolution runs through both .
The effect has , if anything , been even more marked in the Paralympics .
Until Athens in 2004 , Great Britain had never won a gold medal in cycling .
British Cycling 's chief executive , Ian Drake , said : "" Our integrated approach to nurturing talent and supporting athletes on the Olympic and Paralympic programme is clear to anyone who visits British Cycling 's home at the National Cycling Centre .
Our athletes train on the same track and have the support of the same backroom staff - doctors , nutritionists , the team psychiatrist , mechanics and research and development staff . ""
The fact that the Paralympic team 's outstanding success in Beijing – and hopefully too in London – has mirrored the amazing success of our Olympic cycling team demonstrates that this approach has served us well , allowing all of our athletes to reach their full potential . ""
Rik Waddon , who won a silver in the 1 km time trial in Beijing and will compete in the same event in London , said the concept of "" integration "" was not a talking point in Manchester because it was second nature .
"" We have n't gone for integration .
It was there to begin with .
We 've been working alongside them , accessing the same kit they do , the same technology , sports science and everything .
It works really well for us , "" says Waddon , paying tribute to the attention to detail that flows from the British Cycling performance director , Dave Brailsford .
"" They keep coming up with all these marginal gains .
We had all this stuff in Beijing and wondered how it could be better than that .
And four years later , it is .
After Beijing , they looked at it and worked out how to change things staffing - wise , coaching - wise , equipment - wise .
And they 've gone down to the minutest detail . ""
Waddon , who is married to the Paralympic swimmer Natalie Waddon , said his bike was "" very different "" to Beijing .
But he warned that other nations were likely to have caught up , particularly the "" very secretive "" Chinese team that tends not to compete on the world circuit .
"" I just do n't want it to end .
I 'm so glad to be part of this generation and to be able to compete in London .
It 's here
and I 'm part of it , "" said Waddon , recalling the electric atmosphere generated in the velodrome during the Olympics and savouring the prospect of it being replicated over the coming days .
For Britain 's Paralympic cyclists , there is the added bonus of providing the coda to an epic and unprecedented summer of success that stretched from the Champs Elysees to Stratford via the streets of Hampton Court .
For the cycling mad teenager in Waddon it is a dream come true : "" Bradley Wiggins lives in the next village to me .
He 's got the gold postbox in Chorley .
I see him out riding through the winter .
When I was a kid it was Chris Boardman who I had on my wall and now he works in the offices at British Cycling .
"" But he said the achievements of Hoy , Trott , Victoria Pendleton , Jason Kenny and company had not increased the pressure on the 18-strong Paralympic squad . ""
At the end of the day , we produced in Beijing and so did the Olympic guys .
The Olympic guys produced here and I 'm sure we will as well , because we have been on the same programme . """
2012-09-01,"Oscar Pistorius had said that he was worried about what the mood would be like in his room in the athletes ' village on Saturday night .
He is sharing with his South African team - mate Arnu Fourie , and both men are competing in the T44 200 m final on Sunday .
They are actually grouped in different classes – Pistorius is T43 , Fourie T44 – even though both are competing in the same event .
"" It is going to be a bit awkward the night before the final , "" Pistorius said .
"" I might have to drop some sleeping pills in his water . ""
It turns out that Pistorius will not have to worry too much .
They should both sleep well , seeing as they both set world records in the heats .
Pistorius beat his own T43 world record of 21.58sec , set in 2007 , when he finished the third heat in 20.30sec .
In the preceding race , Fourie set a T44 world record of 22.57sec , knocking five hundredths of a second off the time set by the USA 's Jim Bob Bizzell in 2008 .
If it all seems a little confusing , all you need to know is that there are two very happy , very quick South Africans staying in the village .
Unfortunately , the curious – and flawed – categorisation system for the race means that only one of them will be able to win a gold medal .
Fourie 's world record did not even win him his heat , leaving him second behind the USA 's Blake Leeper .
He is at a distinct disadvantage , given that his disability is recognised as being more severe .
Pistorius on the other hand obliterated the competition in his heat .
The two runners bringing up the rear , Sri Lanka 's Dumeera Maduranga Alwis Pituwala Kankanange and Cape Verde 's Marcio Miguel Da Costa Fernandes , were so far behind him that the stadium announcer almost had time to get through their names before they joined him at the finish ."
2012-09-02,"The International Paralympic Committee maintained on Sunday night that the shock new T43/44 Paralympic 200 m champion , Alan Oliveira , who beat the poster boy Oscar Pistorius , had broken no rules .
After Oliveira stunned Pistorius in the final 30 metres of a race the South African had never lost at a major championships , Pistorius accused the Brazilian of running on blades that were too long and made the race unfair . ""
Not taking away from Alan 's performance , he 's a great athlete , but these guys are a lot taller and you ca n't compete [ with the ] stride length .
You saw how far he came back .
We are n't racing a fair race .
I gave it my best . ""
Pistorius said he had been raising the issue with the IPC for "" several weeks "" and also named Blake Leeper , who took bronze , as another rival whose blades were too long .
He said that their blades elevated their knees to four inches above their natural height and lengthened their stride patterns .
Pistorius claimed their times were "" ridiculous "" , despite the fact that the world record he set on Saturday night was 0.15 seconds faster than Oliveira 's winning time of 21.45sec .
The IPC said Oliveira 's blades and those of the American Leeper were well within the legal length .
A spokesman for the IPC said : "" There is a rule in place regarding the length of the blades which is determined by a formula based on the height and dynamics of the athlete .
All athletes were measured today prior to competition by a classifier and all were approved for competition .
"" Later the IPC said it would convene a meeting between Pistorius 's camp and its chief medical officer , Peter van de Vliet , to discuss the South African 's concerns "" without the emotion of tonight 's race "" .
A calmer Pistorius added : "" I 'd just like to congratulate Alan .
I shook his hand outside on the track .
He did a great performance tonight and I wish him the best and my focus is going to be on my upcoming races .
I was n't able to defend my title in the 200 m
but hopefully I 'll be able to do so on the 400 m and maybe , with a bit of luck , the 100 m . ""
Oliveira , who lost his legs at the age of two months , shocked a capacity crowd when he stormed past Pistorius with 30 m to go and won in 21.45sec .
He said he was "" disappointed "" with the claims from Pistorius .
Using tactics usually employed to devastating effect by the South African , Oliveira had tracked Pistorius round the bend and ran him down on the straight to win by seven - hundredths of a second amid gasps from the crowd .
Pistorius had previously praised the fact that Paralympic fields are getting stronger but he was undone by one of the young guns who are now looking to shoot him down .
The South African , who is the first double amputee to compete on the track at both the Olympics and Paralympics , had appeared to be in the form of his life during a heat on Saturday night in which he broke a world record he had set in 2007 .
The "" Blade Runner "" waved to the crowd as he came out to a huge roar and a blaze of flashes but looked nervous before the start .
There was none of Usain Bolt 's braggadocio or horseplay .
Afterwards he appeared disbelieving .
"" I think Alan 's a great athlete but …
I run just over 10 metres per second , I do n't know how you can come back , watching the replay , from eight metres behind on the 100 to win .
It 's absolutely ridiculous . ""
At the start the athletes were forced to wait in the call room for an extra half an hour as the schedule overran amid endless medal ceremonies .
Before the race Pistorius said it was "" great to have rivals in the sport evolving "" .
But his comments after being beaten did not appear to match his pre - race sentiments , as he urged the IPC to look into the issue .
Just as it was the depth of talent in the 100 m and 200 m Olympic fields that made those races iconic , and not simply Bolt 's performances in winning them , so the same is true for Pistorius 's emerging rivals in the Paralympic sprints .
But instead of recognising that fact , Pistorius went on the offensive .
Oliveira said he believed it was a deliberate tactic to unsettle him before the race .
"" Pistorius is a great athlete .
The interview when he said my blades were too big , he was bothered by the time I had in the semi - finals and wanted to get to me with this polemic .
But it did not work .
I do n't know with whom he 's picking a fight , it 's not with me , "" he said .
"" For me he is a really great idol .
And to hear that coming from a really great idol is difficult . ""
Oliveira – who said he was inspired by his family , his girlfriend and "" the whole Brazilian people "" – put his victory down to training and hard work .
Pistorius has long said he views the Olympic and Paralympic Games as equals .
But it is the size and fervour of the crowds in London 's Olympic Stadium that is proving his point .
When he broke the world record in the heats on Saturday night , he brought the house down .
The cheers from the Olympic Stadium mingled with those of the Aquatics Centre , where Ellie Simmonds was writing her own chapter in the history of this remarkable summer .
On Sunday , in front of another capacity crowd of 80,000 fanatical spectators , the cheers for Pistorius were – if anything – even louder .
Oliveira remarked afterwards on the contrast between the huge cheers at the start for Pistorius , who has done so much already to break down the barriers between disabled and non - disabled sport , and the silence when his name was announced .
It was a different story at the finish .
The night brought to mind some of the biggest evenings in the stadium during the Olympics , where anticipation of hoped - for homegrown success from David Weir mingled with the excitement of seeing a genuine global star .
What they got was the biggest shock of either Games to date .
The pair will renew their rivalry in the T43/44 400 m and the 100 m , where they will also face the British world record holder Jonnie Peacock ."
2012-09-02,""" Do n't focus on the disability , "" Oscar Pistorius told the world before these Games . ""
Focus on the ability .
"" In the end there was no room for sentimental thoughts or emotional considerations .
The T44 200 m final was not a procession , nor a coronation , but a race , raw and fast .
And Pistorius lost .
He was beaten to the line by Brazil 's Alan Fonteles Cardoso Oliveira winning in a time of 21.45sec .
Pistorius was .07sec behind him .
He reacted angrily , saying "" we are not racing a fair race "" .
He claimed that Oliveira 's running blades were too long , breaking regulations , and calling for the International Paralympic Committee to investigate .
Pistorius was furious that he had been denied the hat - trick of titles .
He has come along way since he won this title for the first time in 2004 , and this was supposed to be his peak .
Back then he was , in his own words , "" a young kid with braces and curly hair "" .
He had only been running for a year or so , having been forced to give up rugby after he shattered his knee while playing in a school match .
He has changed more still since he won it for a second time , in Beijing in 2008 .
He is leaner , sharper , and faster , having lost 11 kg .
Early in 2009 Pistorius was badly injured in a boating accident .
He spent five days in intensive care .
It changed his attitude .
Before that , he had only dreamed of being an elite athlete .
After it , he started to live and train like one .
He is not the only one .
Oliveira , 20 , had his legs amputated at an early age .
Around them , behind them as he crossed the line , were six other men , each with their own stories and struggles .
At least one of them would n't have been here at all had it not been for Pistorius .
Germany 's David Behre , running in lane one , was hit by a freight train at a level crossing in September 2007 .
He was cycling home from a party , late at night .
The doctors at the Duisburg Trauma Centre amputated both his legs .
The day after the operation , Behre watched a documentary about Pistorius as he lay in his hospital bed , and he thought to himself "" maybe I can do that too "" .
When he first heard that story , Pistorius says he thought : "" I wish that had n't happened to you . ""
Not out of pity , he explained , but because "" he is quick , and quite a threat in the 200 m .
"" There is a little truth in that joke .
The only labels Pistorius wants to claim for himself are those of "" athlete "" , and "" champion "" , he has never wanted to be known as disabled , differently - abled , a role model , an inspiration , or any other of the many tags people have given him in his career .
He rejects the idea that he is a pioneer .
"" I have just been hard working and talented enough to compete on an international level , "" he says .
"" I did not do this to open the doors .
The doors have always been open . ""
And others have been through them .
He is not the first Paralympian to cross over into the Olympics , only the most famous .
Back in 2006 , when Pistorius was competing in the International Paralympic World Cup , obituaries were being written for Neroli Fairhall , who died that year , aged 61 .
She was a paraplegic who competed in archery for New Zealand at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles .
There have been others too .
The partially - blind runner Marla Runyon finished eighth in the 1,500 m for the USA at the 2000 Olympics .
Natalia Partyka , a table tennis player who was born without a right forearm , represented Poland at the Olympics in both 2008 and 2012 .
And Pistorius ' own teammate Natalie du Toit , who lost her left leg after being hit by a car , swam in the open water marathon in Beijing .
None of them were blessed with the rewards that Pistorius has found .
Estimates suggest that he is earning around $ 2 m a year in sponsorship , through his deals with BT , Nike , Oakley , and others .
That ranks him fifth on the list of his sport 's highest earners , a long way behind Usain Bolt but pretty much on a par with anyone else .
Other than the fact that he has a savvy agent and a photogenic smile , the difference between Pistorius and those who came before him is that the governing body of his sport , the IAAF , tried to stand in his way .
For four months , between December 2007 and March 2008 , the running blades Pistorius uses were illegal in able - bodied competition .
The decision was apparently borne out of genuine doubt about whether or not he had an unfair advantage .
Aimee Mullins , a double amputee herself and the chef de mission of the USA 's Paralympic team at these Games , was just one who suspected that other motivations were at work .
"" If we allow a person who we view as our inferior to play with us , and then that person beats us , what does that say about us ?
"" The controversy catapulted him on to the front pages .
But Pistorius turns surly when the topic comes up now .
After all the hours spent arguing his case in laboratories and courtrooms , he has no desire to restate his case now .
The blades he uses now are the same ones he was on then , though the manufacturer has given improved models , explicitly designed to cope with running around bends , to his rivals .
It was an ironic twist that he responded to this defeat by attacking his rival , just as others once attacked him .

This article was amended on 3 September 2012 .
The original said that Oliveira was born without fibula bones .
That is true of Pistorius , not Oliveira ."
2012-09-03,""" Do n't focus on the disability , "" Oscar Pistorius told the world before these Games . ""
Focus on the ability .
"" How right he was .
There was no room for sentimental thoughts or emotional notions after the T44 200 m final .
It was not a procession or a coronation , but a race , raw and fast .
And Pistorius came second .
He was beaten to the line by Brazil 's Alan Fonteles Cardoso Oliveira , who won in 21.45sec .
Pistorius was .07sec behind him .
He reacted furiously , telling the TV cameras in his post - race interview that "" we are n't racing a fair race "" .
Pistorius was convinced that the running blades Oliveira was using were too long , and called for the International Paralympic Committee to investigate .
This from a man who has had to fight long and hard to overturn doubts about whether or not he himself has an unfair advantage when he is competing against non - disabled runners .
The twist in the story is that it is the very fact Pistorius wants to run in the Olympics and other able - bodied competitions that cost him here .
To do crossover like that , he can only run on blades that have been cleared for use by the IAAF , the sport 's governing body .
Longer blades , of the kind Oliveira used , are only legal in Paralympic events .
If Pistorius switched , he would not be able to run in non - disabled competitions .
Besides which , he would undermine his own argument that his success is about the body above the knee , rather than the technology below it .
In a sense , he is a victim of his own ambition .
It was a sour reaction , cutting through the saccharine notes of so much of the Paralympic coverage .
But Pistorius has always insisted that he wants to be known as an athlete , rejecting the labels other people have put upon him , whether they were that he was disabled , differently abled , a cheat , an inspiration , or a role model .
And this was an athlete 's response to defeat , if a particularly ungracious one .
Pistorius has never lost a 200 m race before , and he could not quite believe that it had happened .
Modest as he may sometimes seem – on the startline he responded to the adoring applause of the 80,000 with a polite little bow
– he has , like any champion , a sizeable ego and a temper to match .
Once he had had time to cool down , Pistorius was a more gracious , admitting that Oliveira had "" played by the rules "" and that his blades were within the stipulated limits .
But his anger was still there , bubbling away beneath the surface . ""
He 's never run a 21 second race before .
That 's fact , "" he said of Oliveira . ""
He was running high 23s less than a year ago so you just need to look at the facts behind it .
I brought it up with the IPC
but nothing 's been done about it .
I believe in the fairness in sport and I believe in running on the right length . ""
Pistorius ' point is that Oliveira 's blades were too long , increasing his speed in the final few metres .
"" I 've never seen a guy come back from eight metres on the 100 metre mark and overtake me on the finish line . ""
He had been well ahead after the bend , and looked to be coasting to victory , until Oliveira produced a final , astonishing , turn of speed .
Still , Pistorius ' own time was a lot slower than the world record of 21.30sec he had set in the semi - finals .
If he had been able to repeat that , he would have won with ease .
But he made a schoolboy mistake , tensing up and slowing down as Oliveira came alongside him .
Pistorius seemed as surprised as everyone else in the stadium that suddenly he was in a race for the line .
"" There 's not even another Paralympic amputee to run a 21 second race , "" he insisted , "" let alone a 21.4sec . ""
Like Pistorius , Oliveira had both legs amputated soon after he was born .
"" I am below the maximum length of blades I could have been , "" he pointed out .
"" I do n't know who he is picking a fight with .
It is not about two blades , it is about training . ""
He was eloquent in his rebuttal .
"" All I want to do is thank everybody that helped me get here and celebrate , I am not worried about this polemic that has been raised , this polemic is just about Oscar Pistorius , not about myself .
For me he is a really great idol and to hear that from a great idol is difficult . ""
For four months , between December 2007 and March 2008 , the running blades Pistorius uses were illegal in able - bodied competition .
The controversy catapulted him on to the front pages but Pistorius turns surly when the topic comes up now .
The blades he uses now are the same ones he was on then
and it is ironic that he responded to defeat by attacking his rival , just as others once attacked him .
The two men will race again in both the T44 100 m and the T44 400 m .
Pistorius , the poster boy of the Paralympics , could be hard pushed to win either event .
The signature star may have lost a little of his lustre , but the Games have gained a rivalry that will shape how they are remembered in years to come ."
2012-09-03,"Oscar Pistorius came second in the T44 200 m .
So what 's his problem ?
The South African has been worried about the length of his rivals ' prostheses for some time .
Six weeks before the Paralympics began , he took the unusual step of personally phoning the IPC 's director of communications , Craig Spence , to report rumours that a particular competitor was running with illegally long prosthetic limbs .
The IPC investigated the runner in question – who was not Alan Oliveira , the 20-year - old Brazilian who stunned Pistorius to win gold in the 200 m – and assured Pistorius that his rival was not flouting the IPC 's regulations .
The IPC says it believed that was the end of Pistorius 's complaint but shortly before the Paralympics began , one of Pistorius 's PR team warned the IPC that the South African would go public with his unease over the prosthesis rules during the Games .
Oliveira 's blades are legal , according to the IPC – but the Brazilian had them lengthened recently .
What are the IPC 's regulations for prostheses and blades ?
Prostheses are "" adaptive equipment "" according to Peter Van de Vliet , the IPC 's medical and scientific director : they are designed to restore a loss of function , not artificially enhance body length or performance .
As its rules make clear , the IPC is committed to preventing the use of prostheses that lead to an "" unrealistic enhancement of stride length "" .
How does the IPC calculate the acceptable lengths of prosthetic legs and feet ?
Since 2007 , the IPC has used a formula to calculate the permitted length of prostheses for its athletes .
For double amputees such as Pistorius and Oliveira , this is based on measuring each athlete 's body and arm span , and using this data to estimate their overall height if they had legs .
Athletes are allowed prosthetic limbs and feet that make them up to 3.5 % taller than their estimated height including the blade at the end of their prosthesis .
Many able - bodied athletes are unusually long - limbed and this margin allows for natural variations in body types as well as the fact that athletes stand taller – on their toes – when they run .
Is this formula controversial ?
Not until this week .
According to Van de Vliet , athletes are routinely measured to check they are within the regulations , and to his knowledge there has never been a complaint about the current system .
How do Pistorius and Oliveira match up ?
Pistorius runs at 1845 mm ( just over 6 ft ) but could under the IPC rules extend his prosthesis so he would stand 1935 mm tall .
For all the controversy over Oliveira 's apparently height - enhancing prostheses , the Brazilian is not pushing at the upper limit of the IPC 's rules .
He now runs at 1810 mm but could still extend to 1845 mm under the IPC 's formula .
Pistorius has stuck with the ' Cheetah ' blades he is familiar with .
Is he now at a disadvantage because of a sudden leap in prosthetic technology ?
Both Pistorius and Oliveira use blades made by the same manufacturer , Ossur .
Athletes can use prostheses made by any manufacturer but Van de Vliet says there has not been any recent technological revolution .
Pistorius has stuck with his blades because he has declared he is happy with them but also because he fought so hard to get them approved by the International Association of Athletics Federations .
If he switched blades for the Paralympics , he would be open to accusations that he believes that they can , in fact , confer a physical advantage .
What advantage could a runner gain from longer prostheses ?
Pistorius has claimed that Oliveira 's extended prostheses gave him longer stride lengths and helped him record "" ridiculous "" times – and beat the South African in the 200 m .
According to one blogger 's count , however , Pistorius took 92 steps in the race to Oliveira 's 98 steps .
Of course , Oliveira 's stride may well now be longer than it was before he extended his Ossur running feet but his victory was not built on a longer stride length than Pistorius 's .
Do longer prostheses make athletes quicker ?
They can , by increasingly the stride length , but it is not as simple as that .
Shorter prosthetics can , in theory , also give a runner an advantage over longer - limbed rivals : making him or her quicker out of the blocks at the start .
The IPC agrees that more research is needed on the impact of different protheses over the duration of a race and has already agreed to meet Pistorius and discuss his concerns .
Its formula for prothesis length may well be changed before Oliveira can defend his 200 m title in his home country in 2016 .
The battle over the blades is far from over ."
2012-09-03,"The Brazilian 20-year - old double amputee who sprinted from nowhere to shock the world 's most famous Paralympian has said he felt "" let down "" by claims by Oscar Pistorius that he had won his gold medal unfairly .
Alan Oliveira revealed that he switched to taller prosthetic legs that remained within the legal limit just three weeks before overtaking Pistorius in the final 20 m of their 200 m T43/44 final , but put his gold medal down to hard work and dedication rather than blade technology .
As Pistorius apologised for the timing of claims that rivals gained unfair advantage by using blades that made them unnaturally tall , it emerged the South African had first raised concerns with the International Paralympic Committee ( IPC ) in January 2011 .
The IPC , which confirmed the prosthetics of all eight finalists were within the legal limits before the final , said it would meet Pistorius and his camp after the Games but defended its rules .
"" I was let down by how much he wanted to take away from me the merit for winning gold , "" said Oliveira .
"" All the speculation about my growth , he used that to try and take away from me the merit of winning . ""
In 2008 , Pistorius was the only guy who could run under 22 seconds at 200 m .
So I said I would run as fast as that in London .
I practised , I trained . ""
The South African "" Blade Runner "" , who also competed in the Olympics after a groundbreaking legal battle to be accepted in non - disabled competition , has concerns about the formula employed by the IPC to calculate the maximum possible height of the prosthetic blades used by his competitors .
Under IPC rules he would be allowed to run at a height of 193 cm but has consistently competed on blades that make him 184 cm , partly because they were the ones sanctioned by the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) for use in non - disabled competition .
But by airing his criticism on the London track after being beaten in the 200 m for the first time in nine years , Pistorius has opened himself up to criticism for being a sore loser and contradicting himself after arguing at length that he should be judged on athletic ability rather than technology .
Pistorius , who will face Oliveira again in the 100 m and 400 m , was said to be contrite after realising his outburst had overshadowed not only his young rival but also the British wheelchair racer David Weir 's dramatic 5,000 m victory .
But the South African also refused to back down .
The IPC argues that its rules , based on a formula that determines the likely height of the competitor and adds a variance of 3.5 % to take into account the fact athletes run on their toes rather than their heels , are fair and longstanding . ""
He was hotheaded , "" said a remarkably composed Oliveira , who was surrounded by a scrum of Brazilian media at an impromptu press conference at the gates to the athletes ' village .
"" I was upset with the comments and disappointed .
But he apologised afterwards through the press and I felt better .
He remains an idol to me . ""
"" Nobody who has even kicked a ball in the street likes losing .
I do n't like losing , Pistorius does n't like losing .
But we have to be prepared for everything in life .
I found his reaction strange , "" he said , noting that when the South African lost his 100 m title at the world championships in Christchurch last year he did not make a similar public complaint .
However , it is understood that the South African did in fact complain privately .
He then aired concerns about one particular athlete ( not Oliveira ) six weeks before the Games in a phone call to IPC communications director Craig Spence and his advisers also called the organisation two days before the Games .
Oliveira , who lost his legs at the age of two months to septicemia after contracting an intestinal infection , said he was inspired to start running when , as an eight - year - old , he saw the Brazilian sprinter Robson Caetano da Silva on television .
He was so keen to compete that he initially began running on wooden legs totally unsuited to sprinting and only started competing on carbon fibre blades shortly before his first Paralympic Games in Beijing four years ago .
He moved from his Amazonian hometown of Belem , where his family and friends gathered around the television to watch his victory , to Sao Paulo a year ago to train with the elite Brazilian squad .
His coaches said it was that intensive training , more than his new blades , that resulted in his improving times .
And they reiterated that he had done nothing wrong within the IPC rules .
The runner said that he measured 177 cm in his non - racing prosthetics , but changed to 181 cm Ossur blades three weeks before the Paralympics .
Under the International Paralympic Committee 's rules he is allowed to run on blades that take his height up to a maximum of 184.5 cm . ""
The coaches and I decided to try a higher blade .
I tried the new height for the first time last year and it was difficult to get used to them .
I decided to try them again earlier this year and it went a little bit better .
Three weeks ago , we decided to really go for it , "" he explained .
"" The prosthetics do n't run alone .
Of course they are good for an improvement but there is not a significant time difference . ""
Oliveira 's fastest time on his old blades was 22.45 seconds at the Brazilian National Championships last year – a full second slower than his winning time in London .
But Brazil 's team leader , Ciro Winckler , said his improvement was also the result of better coaching and facilities in Sao Paulo , together with his physical maturity .
One of Pistorius 's complaints is that the rules as they stand allow athletes to chop and change their height at will , as long as they remain within the legal limits determined by an IPC formula .
Along with questions over classification , the march of technology is a key issue for the IPC to grapple with as the Paralympics becomes ever more high profile .
Winckler likened the momentarily stunned silence in the Olympic Stadium when Oliveira crossed the line to the match known as the Maracanazo when Uruguay shocked Brazil in their own stadium at the 1950 World Cup .
He believed Pistorius , faced with a wave of young challengers , may have backed himself into a corner . ""
[ Blake ]
Leeper and Alan were teenagers .
Now they are mature .
Perhaps it 's a problem for Oscar .
It was not a good moment for Oscar . ""
Having done so much to promote the Paralympic movement , Pistorius now faces being overtaken by those he helped inspire .
"" People used to name me the Brazilian Pistorius .
Thank God
I 'm not the Brazilian Pistorius any more .
I 'm Alan , "" said Oliveira ."
2012-09-03,"The International Paralympic Committee has revealed that Oscar Pistorius expressed concerns over the blade length of another athlete weeks before he was beaten in dramatic circumstances by the Brazilian Alan Oliveira in the T43/44 200 m final .
The IPC communications director , Craig Spence , said Pistorius had phoned him when he was having dinner with his parents to express concerns over one particular athlete , who was not named .
Spence said the claims were investigated but that the athlete was found to be within the rules .
He said the point was raised again two weeks ago by Pistorius 's representatives and the IPC suspected it might come up during the Games .
Immediately after the final , Pistorius said Oliveira and Blake Leeper , the American bronze medallist , were racing on blades that were "" unfair "" because they added four inches to their height .
He claimed they were recording "" ridiculous "" times .
He later apologised for the timing of his comments but not the content and the IPC agreed to meet him to discuss his concerns . ""
He shared his views .
He was very emotional .
We agreed we would take his comments away and raise his concerns in a less hostile environment .
The cauldron of the Olympic Stadium was not the place to go into the rules and regulations , "" said Spence .
The IPC has confirmed that the blades of all eight athletes were within the legal length , according to a formula that estimates the height of the athlete and adds 3.5 % to allow for the fact that they run on their toes rather than their heels .
"" We measured all eight athletes in the call room prior to the race .
All eight were legitimate to race .
The measurement is based to proportionality of the body .
Clearly , we do n't want athletes running on stilts .
There are rules in place regarding the prosthesis size , "" said Spence .
The IPC said it would look into whether there should be a change in the rules so that athletes had to race on the same height of blades consistently .
It has been suggested that Oliveira changed the height of his blades between the semi - final and final – something he denied after the race .
"" We will listen to Oscar 's questions on whether variation in that height is something we need to look upon .
At the moment , the rules go with the maximum allowed height .
When these formulas were developed they were discussed with athletes and coaches and feedback collected , "" said Spence .
He denied Pistorius was a special case in light of his high profile and said the IPC had a good relationship with all of its athletes . ""
Oscar phoned me six or seven weeks ago to express concerns about one athlete and his blade length .
We replied within five hours and said the athlete in question was within the regulations , "" he said .
Spence added : "" The original conversation he had with me six weeks ago was about the blade length of one particular athlete .
Last night , whether he was questioning the formula we do n't know .
""
The IPC 's medical and scientific director , Peter van de Vliet , conceded that harmonising rules across disabled and non - disabled sport was difficult .
Pistorius runs on blades that are shorter than the maximum allowable height under IPC rules , because he must run on a specific set that have been approved by the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) for use in non - disabled competition including the Olympics .
The South African waged a legal battle with the IAAF to be able to compete alongside able - bodied athletes after proving the blades gave him no additional advantage . ""
Ultimately , we have two governing bodies involved and it becomes quite a challenge to harmonise rules in this regard .
We do have our own technical rules that are independent of other governing bodies , "" said Van de Vliet .
Spence said it was good for Paralympic sport to see rivals emerging to challenge the supremacy of Pistorius , who had not lost a 200 m race in nine years .
He said it would be unfortunate if the row overshadowed Oliveira 's victory . ""
Alan has not just come out of nowhere and won Paralympic gold .
He won bronze in the 100 m at the world championships and was very competitive in the 200 m .
He is a good and strong athlete .
He has not come out of nowhere and surprised us , "" he said ."
2012-09-03,"The Brazilian Paralympian who dramatically beat Oscar Pistorius in Monday 's 200 m T43/44 final started using his taller prosthetic running blades just three weeks before the London Games , it has emerged .
Alan Oliveira , who shocked the South African reigning champion by beating him for the first time in nine years , moved from his hometown of Belem to Sao Paulo a year ago to train with the elite Brazilian squad .
The runner said he measured 177 cm in his non - racing prosthetics , but changed to new blades that increased his height to 181 cm three weeks before the Paralympics .
Under International Paralaympic Committee ( IPC ) rules he is allowed to run on blades that give him a height of up to 184.5 cm . ""
The coaches and I decided to try a higher blade .
I tried the new height for the first time last year and it was difficult to get used to them .
I decided to try them again earlier this year and it went a little bit better .
Three weeks ago , we decided to really go for it , "" he said .
"" The prosthesis do n't run alone .
Of course they are good for an improvement but there is not a significant time difference . ""
Oliveira 's previous fastest time was 22.45s at last year 's Brazilian national championships .
But Brazil 's team leader , Ciro Winckler , said his improvement was also the result of better coaching and facilities in Sao Paulo , together with the fact he had matured physically .
One of Pistorius 's complaints was that the current rules allow athletes to chop and change their height at will , as long as they remain within the legal limits determined by an IPC formula .
Pistorius races at a height of 184 cm because he continues to use blades that are sanctioned for non - disabled competition , despite the fact that he could wear prosthetics that extended his height to 193 cm under the IPC rules .
The IPC earlier revealed that Pistorius expressed concerns over the blade length of another athlete weeks before he was beaten by Oliveira in Monday night 's final .
The IPC communications director , Craig Spence , said Pistorius had phoned him when he was having dinner with his parents to express concerns over one particular athlete , who was not named .
Spence said the claims were investigated but that the athlete was found to be within the rules .
He said the point was raised again two weeks ago by Pistorius 's representatives and the IPC suspected it might come up during the Games .
Immediately after the final , Pistorius said Oliveira and Blake Leeper , the American bronze medallist , were racing on blades that were "" unfair "" because they added four inches to their height .
He claimed they were recording "" ridiculous "" times .
He later apologised for the timing of his comments but not the content and the IPC agreed to meet him to discuss his concerns . ""
He shared his views .
He was very emotional .
We agreed we would take his comments away and raise his concerns in a less hostile environment .
The cauldron of the Olympic Stadium was not the place to go into the rules and regulations , "" said Spence .
The IPC has confirmed that the blades of all eight athletes were within the legal length , according to a formula that estimates the height of the athlete and adds 3.5 % to allow for the fact that they run on their toes rather than their heels .
"" We measured all eight athletes in the call room prior to the race .
All eight were legitimate to race .
The measurement is based to proportionality of the body .
Clearly , we do n't want athletes running on stilts .
There are rules in place regarding the prosthesis size , "" said Spence .
The IPC said it would look into whether there should be a change in the rules so that athletes had to race on the same height of blades consistently .
"" We will listen to Oscar 's questions on whether variation in that height is something we need to look upon .
At the moment , the rules go with the maximum allowed height .
When these formulas were developed they were discussed with athletes and coaches and feedback collected , "" said Spence .
He denied Pistorius was a special case in light of his high profile and said the IPC had a good relationship with all of its athletes .
The IPC 's medical and scientific director , Peter van de Vliet , conceded that harmonising rules across disabled and non - disabled sport was difficult .
The South African waged a legal battle with the IAAF to be able to compete alongside able - bodied athletes after proving the blades gave him no additional advantage . ""
Ultimately , we have two governing bodies involved and it becomes quite a challenge to harmonise rules in this regard .
We do have our own technical rules that are independent of other governing bodies , "" said Van de Vliet .
Spence said it was good for Paralympic sport to see rivals emerging to challenge the supremacy of Pistorius , who had not lost a 200 m race in nine years .
He said it would be unfortunate if the row overshadowed Oliveira 's victory . ""
Alan has not just come out of nowhere and won Paralympic gold .
He won bronze in the 100 m at the world championships and was very competitive in the 200 m .
He is a good and strong athlete .
He has not come out of nowhere and surprised us , "" he said ."

2012-09-03,"Glue for gold Oscar Pistorius 's Flex - Foot Cheetah running blades , made by the global orthopaedic firm Ossur , always promised to be the most photographed piece of equipment at the Paralympics .
And interest has only intensified following his loss to Alan Oliveira in the 200 m – and his angry complaint that the length of the Brazilian 's blades should not have been permitted . ""
In prosthetics , everything is open to interpretation , "" says Donna Fisher , of Ottobock , which make blades for Germany 's Heinrich Popow and Australia 's Kelly Cartwright .
"" The longer the blade is , the longer the stride can be .
And the blade acts like a spring , so the longer you make the lever - arm , the more you get from that .
But every person is different –
it 's impossible to come up with a rule that applies to everyone . ""
Pistorius argued that he "" could n't compete "" with OIiveira 's stride length , though analysis shows the South African took fewer strides .
The point of running blades , of course , is to replace an athlete 's calves and feet .
But what about their spiked shoes ?
Running spikes are difficult to attach to a smooth , hard carbon - fibre blade .
So until February , Pistorius had to spend hours scuffing his up and gluing on new spikes before each race .
The balance was different each time .
To solve the problem , Nike , one of his sponsors , developed a detachable cushioned pad of spikes .
Designer Tobie Hatfield spent months watching slow - motion footage of Pistorius running on a pressure - sensitive treadmill in Ossur 's Iceland HQ .
Through this , he learned more about the ideal number of spikes ( 11 ) and where to put them .
There 's soft foam at the back of the pad , where Pistorius 's stride begins , and a harder type at the front where it ends .
Gluing time is now down to 15 minutes per leg .
Jerome Singleton , Pistorius 's rival in the 100 m , is also sponsored by Nike , so he 'll be running in a pair as well .
Formula One
wheelchairs
Although it 's often seen as the equivalent of running , wheelchair - racing actually bears a strong resemblance to Formula One .
The shape and structure of the chairs , the materials they 're made from , the athletes ' riding position , clothes , helmets and even the straps they use to hold themselves in place – all these things are constantly being scrutinised and improved .
And following a big push from UK Sport and its sponsors , British times have come down by as much as 10 % in the past two years .
"" It 's an evolution , "" says Dan Chambers , a designer at Draft wheelchairs , which supplies the British team as well as some of its competitors .
"" Athletes like these get a new chair every year , so each time there 's the chance to make small changes .
In the last couple of years , a lot of work has been done to increase the stiffness of chairs .
Flex is not wanted , because it misaligns the wheels , which makes them scrub on the track and lose energy . ""
Aerodynamic work has also been important .
Wheelchair racers such as Shelly Woods ( who came eighth in the 5,000 m but still has the marathon and other distances to come ) and David Weir ( who took the 5,000 m gold ) have had their shapes scanned and analysed by computers , and have even been blown about in wind tunnels –
all to reduce drag .
The results have helped them select helmets and clothing , and have strongly influenced their seating .
"" They 've all been rotated forwards , "" Chambers explains , "" which reduces their frontal area . ""
For these games , the new chairs have a solid aluminium plate beneath the athletes ' knees , which allows smoother airflow than the old cloth upholstery .
Each competitor also has a bespoke welded seat gripping their lower body .
"" There is a chair that 's been developed through all the wind - tunnel testing , which is a very nice stiff light carbon - fibre one , "" adds Chambers .
"" But that 's for the next Olympics . ""
Straps , stirrups and seatbelts It is nearly impossible for disabled athletes to compete in the discus .
Olympic throwers rely on nimble feet as well as upper - body strength to wind up , throw , and then recover .
Try sitting in a chair while throwing a discus
and you 'll almost certainly fall over –
and if you throw as hard as Derek Derenalagi , the former British soldier who lost his legs in a roadside bombing in Afghanistan five years ago , you 'll probably break a bone as well .
Paralympic rules allow competitors to use any chair or frame they want , as long as they can assemble and dismantle it within a certain time limit .
Alison O'Riordan , Derenalagi 's coach , was unhappy with his throwing frame , however , so she contacted the charity Remap , who build customised equipment for disabled people .
A Remap engineer watched Derenalagi training and then designed an extremely strong but lightweight padded stool .
Four straps secure it to the ground , two seatbelts hold Derenalagi on top , and stirrups give his prosthetic feet purchase .
It is far from complicated , but it is precisely what Denelagi needs , holding his lower body in place while allowing the rest of him to move .
"" I can use what is left of my leg muscles and my core muscles to keep control , and also to generate power , "" he says .
Although Derenalagi did n't get a medal in these games , in June his chair helped him to gold at the European Championships , beating the reigning world champion in the process .
Crash , bounce , wallop Equipment can get injured , too – especially in a sport like wheelchair basketball , where players travel at speed and are n't supposed to collide , but do .
"" They get absolutely smashed , "" says Michael Sheen , design and engineering manager at RGK wheelchairs , which supplies Britain 's male and female teams .
"" After a year , the chairs do n't look like they did when they started , that 's for sure . ""
And of course , if a chair breaks during a game , it can be disastrous .
The player can be substituted and the chair repaired , if that is possible , but it often is n't .
As a result , design in this area focuses on the trade - off between strength and weight .
Sheen has conducted a lot of stress analysis , using 3D simulations to determine the strongest frame and , after years of making titanium chairs , has switched to a high - grade aluminium model for these games .
"" It 's much lighter , "" he explains .
"" Essentially , that means it 's easier to push .
It also makes it a bit more responsive , so you can turn and manoeuvre better . ""
The British teams , who at time of writing were both still in contention , have had the new chairs for a year now and love them .
At the Paralympic World Cup in May , the women took gold , and the men silver .
So there 's room for improvement , but not a lot .
The unsinkable stool Despite suffering from chronic regional pain syndrome , which makes it hard for her to stand or walk without a crutch , Britain 's Danielle Brown is an exceptional archer .
When she was 16 , she defeated a field of able - bodied competitors at the national junior championships , using just an adapted piece of old bicycle frame to prop her up .
As an adult , she approached Loughborough university 's Sports Technology Institute to ask if they could do better .
They could .
The trouble with the bike frame was that it lacked stability , and had a tendency to sink into the mud .
So Steve Carr and a team of engineers redesigned it with a broader base , wide feet , and a locking setup and alignment system , to help her find consistency in her position – even outdoors .
Within a week of using the new stool , Brown had beaten her personal best .
The following week , she broke the world record , and subsequently broke it again to win gold at the 2008 Paralympics .
In 2010 , she became the first disabled athlete to represent England in a mainstream event when she was part of the team that won gold at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi .
If she wins Tuesday 's semi - final , consistency will indeed be what she 's found .
A leg of honour Jody Cundy , whose right leg was amputated when he was a child , has already won 10 Paralympic and World Championship gold medals , first as a swimmer and now in cycling .
On the track , he has favoured a solid prosthesis to connect his knee joint to the pedal .
For the London Paralympics , however , Cundy has developed a new leg .
It has had its alignment and aerodynamics reworked , but what clearly excites Cundy most is the new look : it 's been painted with Stella McCartney 's blue ParalympicsGB team design and engraved with the names of all the people who have helped him in his career .
Meanwhile , down the centre of the leg , a "" medal board "" displays those 10 golds .
Although a controversial disqualification and a bronze medal in the 4 km individual pursuit are all he 's been able to take from these games , Cundy 's determined to keep adding to the board .
"" I love customising my leg , "" he says .
"" With so many restrictions on kit and other pieces of equipment , it 's nice to have a bit of creative freedom and stand out from the crowd . ""

2012-09-03,""" He does n't have one single feet , he has one foot , and the other guy , he has n't got two feet . ""
Xand Gale , 3 , is explaining the subtleties of the men 's T44 100 m , which pits 19-year - old British single amputee sprinter Jonnie Peacock against Oscar Pistorius , to his mum as they skip between judo and sitting volleyball .
If there was one Olympic family , there are tens of thousands of Paralympic families .
Virtually every other spectator seems to be small in stature and enormous in enthusiasm , darting between venues and only occasionally being dragged away from the world 's biggest McDonald 's by a parental hand .
It is impossible to find jaundiced views of the Paralympics among spectators of all ages thronging between venues across London but the child 's eye view of these Games makes Boris Johnson 's cheerleading look like Eeyore on a particularly grumpy day .
"" It 's brilliant .
They are so good and they do n't have any legs .
It 's amazing , "" enthuses Sam Pye , 13 , after watching sitting volleyball with his two brothers and mum and dad .
The Pyes are just one of dozens of families I meet who tried and failed to get tickets for the Olympics but were so inspired by what they saw on the television that they snapped up Paralympic tickets instead .
If one or two parents at first saw this as a consolation prize – a strategically useful treat at the end of the long summer holiday –
no - one will admit it now racing between table tennis and swimming , discussing classifications , role models and "" the little guy with no legs "" .
Many of the young spectators are adamant that Paralympians are infinitely superior to Olympians .
"" It 's more inspiring because of how they 've gone so low and come back fighting and sport has completely changed their lives , "" says Sam .
"" It shows that anyone can do it . ""
His older brother , Jonny , 15 , was impressed by the standard of the table tennis .
"" We play table tennis and I could see the difference between how we can play sports and how the professionals play sport . ""
Is it really as good ?
"" It 's just as good , "" says Andrew Spann , 15 , firmly .
"" It 's harder if you 're a Paralympian than a normal Olympian – having a disability makes everything a lot tougher . ""
In the Olympic Park this week , elite Olympians have become "" normal "" – mere mortals – whilst Paralympians have been elevated to something more like Channel 4 's "" superhuman "" ad campaign .
Young people are less self - conscious than most adults about disability and they certainly do n't feel sorry for the competitors .
Lola , 11 , visiting with her mother , grandmother and best friend , insists she preferred to come to the Paralympics . ""
The Paralympics is more exciting than the Olympics , "" she says .
"" The ability and perseverance that the disabled athletes show encourages everyone .
""
Her friend , Ruby , 11 , disagrees .
"" They are both exciting in different ways .
They are two different things .
I think Olympians and Paralympians put as much effort into it as each other . ""
"" The Paralympians , "" says Lola , "" show more courage and determination . ""
Before a row starts , both friends are quick to agree that the Paralympics are "" more encouraging "" for ordinary people than the Olympics .
They are most inspired by the swimming , because they do it at school , and are amazed that anyone can even stay afloat without the use of all four limbs . ""
It shows that anyone can do a sport , "" says Lola .
With the new term looming once again , the Paralympics also mean credibility in class .
This is probably a stupid question but does it make you cooler at school if you 've been to the Paralympics ? ""
A little bit , "" says Jared Gale , 7 , who I bump into with his mother and younger brother after first meeting them stoically waiting for two hours for a glimpse of the Paralympic torch .
"" Everyone 's going to be talking about it at school , "" adds Jared .
"" Everybody is going to be saying ' we did this , we did that . '
"" For children and their parents , the Paralympics have not just been a useful diversion in that troublesome final week of the summer holidays usually governed by tedious school uniform shopping trips .
For parents , the Paralympics offers a winning blend of horizon - broadening family day out , complete with "" real "" role models and slightly less virtuous one - eyed soft toys .
"" I 've now got role models for my children that I want them to look up to , not the Big Brothers of this world , "" says Jane Gale .
Several parents say they are helping their children compile old - fashioned scrap - books of the Games to give them something to look back on , as well as look up to .
"" It 's really cool .
It 's good for the kids to see , "" says Natasha Jeffers , who has brought her son , Alexander , 5 , to see the Olympic Park and goalball .
"" For him to see that there are other people in the world who are different – with no limbs or ca n't see – means that when he meets similar people in the real world he wo n't feel scared or stare . ""
Lola 's grandmother , Pat Briggs , from Tunbridge Wells , approves of how the Paralympics appears to change children 's mindsets .
"" It makes them more simpatico to people in wheelchairs , "" she says .
"" It makes them see them not as second - class citizens . ""
Perhaps for all the consciousness - raising , tolerance - building qualities that the Paralympics may bestow on children , their clear - eyed delight in the achievements of these athletes is changing the mindsets of the adults watching the Games as well ."
2012-09-04,"Yes I admit it .
I shed a few tears after the 100 m final on Sunday .
I only ever want to do the best I can .
I felt really good during the heats .
But my start was poor .
And over the first 5 metres I just was n't powerful enough to work my way back into the race .
I can suggest all sorts of reasons why I finished sixth .
But they 're all excuses .
I did n't do it when it mattered .
And that 's the truth of it .
But we have a rule .
We 're allowed to dwell on disappointment for an hour and then move on .
So I 've done that
and now I 'm concentrating on the 200 m , which is scheduled for Thursday .
One of the effects of being at the Games is that you learn so much about yourself .
We all come out different people from how we came in .
It 's hard as an athlete to say your event does n't have a consequence .
But as my coach told me : the world did n't end after my race .
The trains did n't stop .
We like to think we make a difference – particularly in the Paralympics .
But it 's up to the crowd and those watching and listening at home to give the Games their real significance .
My focus now is to nail the start of the 200 m and get a good transition round the bend .
That 's where the 200 is won and lost .
There are no heats for the ' 2 ' and so start lanes will be selected at random .
I prefer an outside lane because of my stride length , so we 'll just have to wait and see .
The whole point of the Paralympics is to have races that are fair .
That 's why the classification system is in place .
Truth is , though , only the doctors and physios who establish the rules fully understand the structure .
It 's certainly not clear to outsiders and it does cause confusion .
In my category – cerebral palsy – it 's all about brain damage .
So our situation rarely changes .
Others with progressive illnesses are also checked regularly and they can go from one category to another .
In the Oscar Pistorius controversy , I thought his race was quite fair .
He and Alan Oliveira crossed the line pretty much together .
It simply shows Alan was the better runner on the day .
In the wider context my view is that blades do give you an advantage over able - bodied athletes .
For example , the blade runners do n't have feet so they do n't suffer tendonitis or stress fractures .
It also means they can train longer and harder than their counterparts .
Coaches also say the blades delay body fatigue , which is what 400 m running , for instance , is all about .
For these reasons it was wrong in my opinion that Oscar was allowed to take part in the Olympics .
You look at the advantages and disadvantages and it 's the courts that decide it all in the end
and I do n't believe that 's right either .
Oscar has put Paralympics on the map , no question about that .
And this may not be PC , but whether he likes it or not perhaps he should just acknowledge that he 's disabled .
We 're fortunate in the Paralympic programme that our image has n't been affected by drug scandals .
But when we see exceptional performances we do start to question things .
We 're randomly tested through the year .
I 've had three so far in 2012 .
There 's a knock on your door at eight in the morning and you have to give a urine sample .
The pressure to pee on demand is tough , I can tell you .
But when I look around the athletes ' village here , hand on heart , I can honestly say there are no suspicious characters .
Whatever happens next , I 'll never forget the sensation I felt when the crowd started cheering before my 100 m .
It really was amazing .
If I could I 'd bottle it and give it to everyone .
What a difference that would make .
The support is phenomenal and even if I go home with nothing but that acknowledgment from the crowd for all the hard work and effort that we put in will have made it all worthwhile .

2012-09-05,"South African officials have registered a formal complaint with the International Paralympic Committee , reigniting the row over whether rivals to Oscar Pistorius are breaking the rules by swapping their prosthetic blades mid - competition .
Although Pistorius attempted to quell the row by apologising for the timing of his outburst after being beaten in the 200 m for the first time in nine years by the Brazilian Alan Oliveira , the South African Parlaympic Committee has raised the issue again .
In a letter to the IPC delivered on Tuesday , it asked the world governing body to investigate whether Pistorius 's rivals had changed the height of their blades between the heats and the finals , which is against the rules .
The IPC said it had investigated the claims by immediately asking coaches in the athletes ' village whether their athletes had switched their blades .
"" They asked the IPC to urgently investigate allegations that a number of T43 athletes were running on different - sized prosthesis for semi - finals and finals and different events , "" said the IPC director of communications , Craig Spence .
"" When we put the allegation to the coaches about different - sized running blades , there was a look of shock because it 's difficult to do .
There is no evidence they were competing on different - sized running blades . ""
He admitted the IPC did not record the height of the competing athletes before each race .
It simply measures whether they are beneath the maximum height permitted under the formula it uses to calculate the allowable length of prosthetic blades .
But he said unless the South Africans came forward with new evidence , the matter was closed .
Oliveira switched to his new blades , 4 cm higher than his old pair , three weeks before the Paralympics , and said he was disappointed with Pistorius for raising the issue after the 200 m T43/44 final .
Pistorius races at a height of 184 cm because he continues to use blades that are sanctioned for non - disabled competition , despite the fact that he could wear prosthetics that extended his height to 193 cm under the IPC rules .
Oliveira raced in the 200 m at a height of 181 cm , 3.5 cm below his maximum allowable height under the rules .
The IPC said it wrote to all participating countries and athletes in April to ask if they had any concerns regarding wheelchairs or prosthesis but had received no response .
But the South African Paralympic Committee said in its letter that Pistorius had raised the issue several times informally with the IPC since the world championships in New Zealand last year ."
2012-09-05,"Only a few months ago Jonnie Peacock reckoned his greatest achievement was simply sharing a track with his hero Oscar Pistorius .
Imagine how he will feel if he beats him .
At 9.24pm on Thursday night the two men will take to the track for the T44 100 m final , along with the six other quickest amputees in the world .
It was already set up to be one of the showpiece events of the Paralympic athletics but it looks even more exciting now .
Pistorius squared off against Brazil 's Alan Oliveira , the man who beat him in the 200 m final , again on Wednesday night .
This time the two were running the final leg of the T42/46 4x100 m relay and it was Pistorius who won .
He led his team to gold , in a world record time of 41.78sec .
Oliveira came up on his shoulder in the final few metres , just as he had in the 200 m final , but Pistorius was able to hold him off .
There was a measure of redemption for that defeat then , but now all eyes will be on the 100 m final .
Peacock , a 19-year - old from Cambridge , will start as favourite .
He won his heat with ease , equalling the Paralympic record of 11.08 .
Pistorius was the next fastest but was still 0.1 slower .
Peacock beat Oliveira and the silver medallist from Beijing , the USA 's Jerome Singleton , by more than 0.3 .
He admitted he had expected both men to "" push him a little more "" .
They may have been saving a little for the relay later in the evening .
"" I know that Jonnie was ready , "" said Singleton .
"" He 's in front of his home crowd and he wanted to put on a show .
It 's going to be a very tough race .
You 've got some of the best amputees in the world who are going to line up here .
"" Pistorius has not run a personal best in the 100 m for more than five years and has said his aim here was simply to make the podium .
"" I was at the top for many years and , if the sport 's evolved , that 's one of the best things that could ever have happened . ""
He may have changed his attitude since Sunday night , feeling he has more to prove .
A little over two months ago one would have got long odds on Peacock being the one Pistorius would have to beat .
But then on 1 July Peacock broke the T44 world record , taking it down to 10.85 .
That is the kind of time he will be looking to run in the final . ""
It was a bad wind , a big wind , "" he said .
"" I 'll be a bit quicker in the final .
"" Peacock was not all that happy with his performance .
He says he will sit down with his coach , Dan Pfaff , and analyse the tape of the race . ""
The end of the race was n't as controlled as I 'd like it to be –
I need to keep my core stronger – and my start could have been better . ""
Pfaff has helped Peacock knock almost a second off his personal best in the last year , an improvement that made Pistorius sit up and take notice ."
2012-09-05,"Do n't miss No question what 's the event of the day , as Oscar Pistorius and Alan Oliveira square up again in the T44 100 m final , four days after the Brazilian triumphed in the 200 m , enraging Pistorius who claimed he had a technical advantage .
Neither man will start the event as favourite , however - the fastest man in the field is in fact 19-year - old Briton Jonnie Peacock , who became the quickest amputee sprinter ever when he broke the world record in June .
American Blake Leeper , the only other competitor to have broken 11 seconds , is also worth keeping an eye on .
9.24pm Sport of the day : sailing A big day in Weymouth , when all three of the sailing competitions reach their conclusion after six days of competition .

As other leading athletes backed his call for the rules to be changed , South African officials wrote to the world governing body to suggest some of his rivals were cheating by switching blades mid - competition .
Pistorius returned to the Olympic Stadium for the first time since his shock defeat , winning his heat to qualify for Thursday 's 100 m final alongside the Brazilian who beat him in the 200 m and Britain 's Jonnie Peacock , who recorded the fastest time .
Afterwards Jerome Singleton , the American who beat Pistorius in the 100 m at last year 's world championships , said he and other single leg amputees shared concerns over the way the maximum allowable height of double amputees was calculated .
April Holmes , the US Paralympic gold medallist who holds the world record in the 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in the T44 class for single leg amputees , also weighed into the row in support of Pistorius .
"" It takes a great leader to stand up and tell somebody that they do not think what is happening is correct .
We and our governing bodies have been in constant discussion with the IPC trying to make sure that the sport moves forward .
We want to be accepted for our athletic ability and not our prosthetic devices , "" said Holmes .
"" We all train hard .
At the end of the day , we all understand there is a rule issue .
So we are truly thankful that the IPC has agreed to sit down and discuss it .
We welcome that scientists are looking at what is an appropriate height for athletes with missing legs and what are the appropriate things to make the playing field level . ""
Singleton said that a group of single leg amputees , who fear that double leg amputees are gaining an unfair advantage by switching between longer blades for the 200 m and shorter blades for the 100 m , had brought the issue to the attention of the IPC in March .
"" We all came together , the single leg amputees , and expressed our opinion about their formula .
We want them to re - evaluate their formula , "" said Singleton .
"" Just re - evaluate the formula , make sure you 've got a good idea of the height for an amputee and make sure you 've got a small area of variance . ""
The intervention of the South African Paralympic Committee further raised the stakes in a row that threatens to overshadow Pistorius 's attempts to win more medals at a Games he had hoped to dominate .
Although Pistorius has since attempted to calm the row by apologising for the timing of his outburst after being beaten in the 200 m for the first time in nine years , he has refused to withdraw his claims that the Brazilian won "" unfairly "" by racing on unnaturally high blades .
Now , the South African Parlaympic Committee has asked the world governing body to investigate whether Pistorius 's rivals changed the height of their blades between the heats and the finals , which is against the rules .
The IPC said it had investigated the claims by immediately asking coaches whether their athletes had switched their blades .
"" They asked the IPC to urgently investigate allegations that a number of T43 athletes were running on different - sized prosthesis for semi - finals and finals and different events , "" said the IPC director of communications , Craig Spence .
"" When we put the allegation to the coaches about different - sized running blades , there was a look of shock because it 's difficult to do .
There is no evidence they were competing on different - sized running blades . ""
But he admitted the IPC did not record the height of the competing athletes before each race .
It simply measures whether they are beneath the maximum height permitted under the formula it uses to calculate the allowable length of prosthetic blades .
Responding to claims that some athletes had switched to different prosthetics between different races , he said that it was not allowed under IPC rules and that technical officials had on Wednesday been on the look out for variations in the call room before the race and "" found nothing suspicious "" .
Spence said unless new evidence was presented , the matter was closed .
However , the IPC has agreed to meet with the South African Paralympic Committee and Pistorius after the Games to discuss the issue .
Oliveira switched to his new Ossur blades , 4 cm higher than his old pair but 3.5 cm shorter than the maximum allowed , three weeks before the Paralympics .
He said he was disappointed with Pistorius for taking the shine off his victory .
Pistorius races at a height of 184 cm because he continues to use blades that are sanctioned for non - disabled competition , despite the fact that he could wear prosthetics that extended his height to 193 cm under the IPC rules .
The IPC said it wrote to all participating countries and athletes in April to ask if they had any concerns regarding wheelchairs or prosthesis but received no response .
But the South African Paralympic Committee said in its letter that Pistorius had raised the issue several times informally with the IPC since the world championships in New Zealand last year .
He first raised the issue at the world athletics championships in January last year , complained informally again in March and sent a Twitter message to Spence in mid - July , after the American Blake Leeper equalled his 100 m record .
Leeper , who won bronze in the 200 m , was the other athlete mentioned by Pistorius in his post race rant on Sunday .
It is believed that Pistorius sent a message to Spence asking for the length of Bleeker 's blades to be looked into .
Spence passed the message on to IPC officials , who found there to be no issue .
Canadian sprinter Alister McQueen said it was incumbent on the IPC to look at the issue , while stressing the double amputees were operating within the rules . ""
Oscar , I 've talked to him .
He got caught up in the heat of the moment .
What he is saying is true .
There 's just so much emotion it did n't come out the way he wanted it to .
Look at the races , "" said McQueen .
"" They are running 200 m , they have to go a longer distance and they can wear higher prosthetics .
They 're running the 100 m , they need a faster turnover and need to come out of the blocks better , they wear lower prosthetics . """
2012-09-06,"He has been called , inevitably , the British "" blade runner "" , but that is to do a disservice to a sprinting talent who has burst out of the blocks in the last 12 months , leaving the competition in his wake .
Jonnie Peacock , the T44 100 m sprinter who takes on Oscar Pistorius and Brazil 's Alan Oliveira on Thursday night , deserves to be judged on his own talent , not compared to someone else 's .
The sprinter was on few radars until relatively close to these home games .
Only 15 when Pistorius cruised to victory in 2008 in Beijing , Peacock was inspired to start taking the track seriously and since his 100 m debut at the London disability athletics challenge in 2009 his improvement has been rapid .
Now 19 , Peacock has taken almost a second off his time in 12 months .
He took part in his first international meet in May this year , coming first in the T43/44 100 m at the Paralympic orld cup in Manchester .
In July he beat the world record , running 10.85 , 0.06 faster than the previous T44 record set in 2007 by the American 2004 champion , Marlon Shirley , and better than the 10.91 mark set by Pistorius , a T43 ( the classification for athletes with double amputations below the knee ) sprinter , five years ago .
Cambridge – born Peacock had to have his right leg amputated below the knee after contracting a form of meningitis at the age of five .
He started athletics almost accidentally , after asking about disability sport at the hospital that fitted his prosthetic leg in his teens with the aim of joining a football team .
The experts pointed him to a Paralympic talent day in Mile End in London and at a subsequent five - month intensive programme he found himself in a bidding war between wheelchair tennis , shooting and athletics .
In a pre - Games interview he said : "" Obviously I picked athletics because it 's the best event .
I just love sprinting because it 's so raw .
Literally from here to here , how fast can you go ?
You do n't pace yourself , just go nuts .
Pure speed .
I love it .
"" Peacock , competing in his first Paralympics , talked of his pride at simply making the team .
"" To be part of a home Paralympics – I 'm so proud , "" he said .
"" To be part of the Paralympic movement at the moment – it 's getting better day by day .
"" Peacock , a charmer well aware of his talents , is one of many Paralympians in these games who defies people watching him to judge him on his disability , rather than the raw ability he demonstrates .
"" When I was 13 - 14 I used to think , why me , I wish I had two legs , "" he said .
"" But I would n't wish for a second now that I had two legs .
I would n't have the opportunities I have had [ … ]
I would n't change it for a second . """
2012-09-06,"Sailing : 11 am Weymouth and Portland
The sixth and final day of sailing competition will see the three available gold medals finally decided .
The British pair of Alexandra Rickham and Niki Birrell will be hoping for glory in the Skud , having followed their fifth - place finish in Beijing with victory at the 2009 , 2010 and 2011 world championships and , perhaps more pertinently , success at the Sail for Gold regatta over the Olympic course in June .
Athletics : 9.58pm Olympic Stadium The men 's T44
100 m final is possibly the most hotly - anticipated race of the entire Paralympics , featuring the USA 's world champion Jerome Singleton , the South African superstar and 2008 winner Oscar Pistorius and Britain 's new world record holder , Jonnie Peacock .
Another home hope , Dan Greaves , comes up against America 's Jeremy Campbell in the T44 discus at 8.31pm .
Cycling :
10.30am Brands Hatch Four road races will be held today , with contestants including the Czech Republic 's five - time gold medallist Jiri Jezek , whose race starts at 2.30pm , and GB 's Sarah Storey , who has five golds for swimming and two for cycling .
Her race begins at 2.32pm and she will be looking to do better than her last - place performance on Celebrity Mastermind in January .
Contender : Hannah Cockroft , T34 200 m , 8.12pm
The 19-year - old sprinter from Halifax is the current world record holder in the 100 m , 200 m and 800 m .
She is also world champion in the 100 m and 200 m and is favourite to win both events in London .
In 2010 , she broke seven world records over eight days .
100 :
The top speed , in mph , of the wheelchair tennis player Stéphane Houdet 's serve ."
2012-09-06,"David Bowie 's ubiquitous soundtrack to the summer rang out again at the Olympic Stadium on Thursday night to acclaim a new sporting hero in 19-year - old Jonnie Peacock , who sprinted to victory in the blue riband Paralympic event .
The single - leg amputee charged to victory in 10.90 in the T34/44 100 m – the second fastest time in history behind his own world record – and left Oscar Pistorius trailing in fourth place .
Peacock was one of a trio of British gold medallists on another memorable night for ParalympicsGB on which the team beat their pre - Games medal target with three days of competition to spare .
Hannah Cockroft , the 20-year - old wheelchair racer from Halifax , did the sprint double with victory in the T34 200 m final , and David Weir bagged his third gold of the Games in the men 's 800 m T54 final in a time of 1.37.63 .
Despite increased competition from the rest of the world , the trio helped ParalympicsGB comfortably exceed their target of recording "" more medals in more sports "" than in Beijing , where they won 102 .
By the end of the action , as a crowd drunk on home success staggered away from the Olympic Stadium , the total stood at 107 medals , 31 of them gold .
The "" Weirwolf "" , greeted on to the track by his newly adopted theme tune Werewolves of London , refused to be beaten .
As the now familiar strains of Massive Attack 's Unfinished Sympathy rang out Weir hit the front on the back straight of the last lap and narrowly held off the Swiss Marcel Hug and Thailand 's Saichon Konjen to huge cheers as he crossed the line .
He said afterwards he was tired but that the exhortations of discus thrower Dan Greaves , who on Thursday night won silver himself , on the final bend kept him going .
"" That was hard work tonight .
I had to dig deep , "" said Weir , who will race again in the marathon on Sunday .
"" This is for my children .
This one 's for my kids tonight .
I just had to dig deep . ""
But there was little doubting the main event for a crowd for whom the lure of the Olympic Stadium seems to be increasing as the end draws nearer and they milk the last drops from this summer of sport .
Just as Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake had the nation rapt four weeks ago , it was a measure of how far the Paralympics have come in terms of profile that the T43/44 100 m had much the same effect on Thursday night .
Peacock , the Cambridge - born sprinting sensation who recorded the fastest time ever by an amputee when he ran 10.85 seconds earlier this year , was up against Pistorius , one of the biggest names of this Olympic and Paralympic summer .
He appeared to revel in the support of 80,000 fans chanting his name before they were silenced for the start of a 100 m race that matched its Olympic companion for excitement .
Amid huge tension , Alan Oliveira – the 20-year - old who beat Pistorius in the 200 m on Sunday night – tottered out of his blocks .
But Peacock was calmness personified .
The tension was further ratcheted up by a pre - race row over the length of the blades used by some sprinters , which pitted Pistorius , Jerome Singleton and others against Oliveira and Blake Leeper .
The South African – accused of sour grapes by some over the timing of his comments – was gracious in defeat to Peacock , hugging the young pretender at the finish of the 100 m .
"" What people were able to witness tonight was the beginning of a phenomenal career for Jonnie Peacock , "" said Pistorius , who also finished behind the American Richard Browne and fellow South African Arnu Fourie .
""
He epitomises professional sprinting , not just as a Paralympian but one of the world 's best .
To be part of that race was a blessing .
"" Peacock had to have his right leg amputated below the knee after contracting a form of meningitis at the age of five and was first spotted at a talent ID day at Mile End stadium .
"" It 's absolutely surreal .
I 've been in the village for over a week trying to stay focused , "" he said , also paying tribute to his coach Dan Pfaff , who also trained Olympic gold medal winning long jumper Greg Rutherford .
"" It 's going to take a while to sink in .
I got to 60 m and thought , ' Oh dear I could actually win this "" . ""
Cockroft came into these Paralympic Games as the double world champion and world record holder in the 100 m and 200 m .
But like others including Jessica Ennis , Mo Farah , Weir and Ellie Simmonds across both Games , the pressure has not fazed her .
If anything , the opposite is true .
Under a spectacular golden sky Cockroft won by more than two seconds , a huge margin in a wheelchair sprint , in a time of 31.90 with a display of raw speed and power . ""
This summer has been breathtaking , this is what all the training has been for .
I hope we 're doing everyone proud , everyone 's excited
and I do n't want this ever to end .
It 's been amazing .
"" She is now one of a number of British Paralympic athletes who in the space of a week have become household names . ""
There is definitely something that has happened in the Paralympic movement that makes me unbelievably emotion , "" said Pistorius .
"" There are millions of people out there for whom Paralympic athletes are now household names .
For me , that 's better than anything . ""
At Brands Hatch , Sarah Storey made Paralympic history by winning the 11th gold medal of her career , and the fourth of these Games , in the women 's cycling road race .
Appropriately , given the run of success for ParalympicsGB in the pool , it was in the Aquatics Centre that Heather Frederiksen surpassed ParalympicsGB 's Beijing tally by winning silver .
Funding agency UK Sport had invested a record £ 49.2 m in Paralympic sport in the runup to the London Games and , as at the Olympics , the investment has paid off . ""
The London Paralympic Games have been a truly wonderful display of sporting excellence and a testament to the power of the human spirit .
To see what our athletes have achieved has been inspirational , "" said UK Sport chair Lady Sue Campbell ."
2012-09-06,"Day eight : 6 September There may have been a brief look at South Africa 's Oscar Pistorius during the Olympic Games , but the Blade Runner really comes into his own today .
The T44 100 m ( 9.58pm ) is one of the highlight events of the entire Games and should see Pistorius pushed all the way to retain his gold medal .
Great Britain 's Jonnie Peacock is the fastest man on the track , but the USA 's Jerome Singleton and South Africa 's Arnu Fourie are not far behind .
This race should be a little closer than Usain Bolt 's romp to gold .
GB 's Libby Clegg and Hannah Cockroft are also in action today , racing in the T12 200 m ( semi - finals 12.41pm , finals 7.42pm ) and the T34 200 m ( round 11.47am , final 8.12pm ) .

2012-09-07,"Britons to watch The sporting action may be drawing to an end , but the final day at the Aquatics Centre is as busy as ever , with 15 gold - medal races .
The highlight will be Ellie Simmonds ' last race of the Games in the S6 100 m freestyle against Mirjam de Koning - Peper of the Netherlands , who beat her in the European championships , and the USA 's Victoria Arlen , who beat Simmonds 's world record in June .
Heats
9.57am
Do n't miss
He made history on 5 August racing in the semi - finals of the able - bodied event , and today Oscar Pistorius completes the 400 m double , attempting to defend his T44 gold from Beijing ( and see off the challenge of Alan Oliveira , who beat him in the 200 m ) .
This is the last event of the Games to be held in the Olympic stadium .
Final 9.57pm Sport of the day
It 's the final of the five - a - side football for visually impaired athletes , and Brazil ( who else ) square up against France at the Riverside stadium in what will surely be a highly competitive final .
The bronze match , featuring Spain and Argentina , is scarcely less tasty .
Bronze 1.30pm
; gold 3.45pm Weather : mostly sunny"
2012-09-08,"It was a more than an appropriate way to sign off from the sporting action at this magnificent cauldron of noise and light .
Oscar Pistorius , the South African "" Blade Runner "" who has been a constant and sometimes controversial presence over London 's glorious summer of sport , capped it by retaining the 400 m crown he values above all others .
Pistorius had promised another capacity crowd "" something special "" in his 11th race across both Games after cruising through his heat and he did not disappoint , blowing away the opposition to win his first individual gold of the Games .
A "" proud "" Pistorius , who exploded with delight and relief as he crossed the line , took the honour of being the last to win a gold in the Olympic Stadium – and the latest to pay tribute to the crowd .
"" It was very special to me .
It was the last event of my season and the last event of the Games , "" said the South African , who has been under intense pressure .
"" I was very nervous before today 's race , I was quite tired , but the crowd just kept me going . ""
Exploding out of the blocks and onto the shoulder of Alan Oliveira , the young Brazilian who beat him in the 200 m but appeared to be carrying an injury .
Pistorius was well ahead by the time they rounded the first bend and it rapidly became clear that this was not going to be a race but a procession .
He rounded the final band some 20 metres ahead of Blake Leeper and crossed the line almost three - and - a - half seconds ahead of the American in a new Paralympic record of 46.68 seconds .
The idiosyncrasies of the classification system were again highlighted by the fact that the single amputee David Prince broke the T44 world record but finished with a bronze in 50.61 seconds .
The International Paralympic Committee has promised to try and split the categories in time for Rio .
If Pistorius had hurt his image with his outburst about the length of the blades worn by his competitors after the 200 m final , then no one appeared to have told the 80,000 crowd inside the Olympic Stadium .
They again cheered him long and loud before and after the race .
"" I 'm so proud .
This summer has been a dream come true .
Locog have done the most amazing Olympic and Paralympic Games .
It 's been a blessing , "" concluded a clearly relieved Pistorius after the race .
He admitted that he had been unsure how his new rival Oliveira , who ran in the lane outside him , would approach the race .
In his heat , he had blasted the first 200 m then almost jogged the rest .
Settling into his blocks in front of Thomas Heatherwick 's now familiar cauldron that has burned throughout the summer , Pistorius looked more relaxed at the start than he did before his shock defeat to Oliveira .
A cursory look at the times of those competing confirmed Pistorius 's status as a hot favourite : his fastest this season was more than two seconds faster than the next best –
Leeper .
And his personal best was a huge five seconds faster than anyone in the field .
It was in the 400 m that Pistorius first started to blur the lines between Olympian and Paralympian and it was in his favoured event that he became the first amputee athlete to compete in the track in both Games .
But if Pistorius and his advisers had envisaged this summer as the crowning achievement of a glorious and ground - breaking career , the reality as ever has been rather more complicated .
He won respect and admiration in the Olympics , but was accused of sour grapes after raising the issue of blade length immediately after losing his 200 m title in the Paralympics .
Perhaps inevitably , it is Pistorius who has personified many of the issues around these Games – from the vastly increased profile that has made him one of the most recognisable sportsmen on the planet to the complex debates about classification and technology that the movement will have to wrestle with as it makes the most of the step change London has provided .
Most of all , he has proved he is not only a supreme athlete but human after all .
Not only has he lost two of the three titles he won in Beijing , but he was forced to apologise for the timing of his outburst after the 200 m final . ""
The beauty of life is that you 're always learning .
It 's easy to be gracious when you win but to be humble when you lose is not so easy
and I 've had to learn that , "" he said after helping the South Africans to gold in the 4 x 100 m .
Yet last night he proved he had the drive , the desire and the speed to stay well ahead in his signature event ."
2012-09-08,"With the South African flag draped around his shoulders , a smile stretched across his face , Oscar Pistorius was in no rush to finish his lap of honour on Saturday night .
He mouthed his thanks to the crowd , stopping to wave and shake hands as he made his way around the track .
It was – at last – his moment and he was going to enjoy every second of it .
The final sporting event in this gasp - inducing Olympic Stadium was , to the joy of the 80,000 watching inside it , won by the man who has done more than any other to pull the Paralympics from the edge of sporting endeavour and into the public consciousness .
It was a fitting ending to an extraordinary summer for the man they call "" Blade Runner "" .
Since the opening ceremony of the Olympics he has run 11 races in this stadium , leaving it until the very last to win his first individual gold .
Pistorius made history last month , becoming the first double - leg amputee to take part in an Olympic Games after winning a fierce battle with his own sport 's governing body for the right to compete .
The sprinter , who had both legs amputated as an 11-month - old , failed to make it to the final of the 400 m , but the accolades that rained down on him set the stage for the 25-year - old to become the king of the London 2012 Paralympics , an event he was expected to dominate .
It did n't quite happen like that .
There was a shock defeat in the T44 200 m final , in which Pistorius came second to the 20-year - old Brazilian Alan Oliveira , followed by an accusation from Pistorius that the younger sprinter was running on blades that were too long and had an unfair advantage .
The controversy engulfed the Games and forever changed the image of a man who until these Games had been the only Paralympian with a truly global reach .
Pistorius , who won his first gold in Athens as a 17-year - old , was soon back on winning form with the South African team , taking gold in the men 's 100 m relay and setting a new world record of 41.87 seconds .
But the following night there was further disappointment when he was roundly beaten by the British sprinter Jonnie Peacock in the T44 100 m final , finishing in fourth place .
The Blade Runner that leaves these Paralympic Games , then , is a different man to the sprinter who arrived in a blaze of glory from the Olympics .
But his lack of dominance in London – and the size of the row that erupted around his comments – is surely testament to his impact on Paralympic sport .
A 15-year - old Peacock saw Pistorius win three gold medals in Beijing and was inspired to push harder on the track .
When the 200 m finalist David Behre from Germany lay in his hospital bed after a double - leg amputation it was a documentary about Pistorius that got him up and running .
It is difficult to overestimate the esteem in which other athletes hold the sprinter .
Before his 100 m win , Peacock spoke of his idol with a respect that bordered on reverence .
Oliveira looked crushed when he heard , in the wake of his shock victory in the 200 m , that the South African had questioned the length of his blades , saying : "" For me he is a great idol and to hear that from a great idol is difficult . ""
Whether the blades row has permanently tarnished Pistorius 's image – and his brand , which is estimated to be worth around £ 2 m a year – will be played out in the months and years to come .
But the impact of his outburst and the mea culpa of sorts that followed – he apologised for the timing of the outburst , if not its contents – may not be entirely negative .
After it , he is no longer Pistorius the poster boy , the magnanimous mouthpiece of disabled sport , but an athlete who can lose and be unhappy about it .
Human , not superhuman .
That does not detract from his achievements leading up to and including London 2012 –
it magnifies them .
Pistorius , who will be 29 in Rio , will undoubtedly see more of his titles disappear , perhaps even the beloved 400 m he won so comfortably on Saturday night .
But he will ever be the man who opened the door for outstanding Paralympians to take part in the Olympics and the athlete who changed the face of disabled sport .
The huge roar that went up in the Olympic stadium on Saturday night , as he received the final track medal of London 2012 , felt like a resounding recognition of that ."
2012-09-08,"Day ten : 8 September The competition has been whittled down and today sees the final of the five - a - side football tournament ( 3.30pm ) .

2012-12-13,
2013-02-14,"For us South Africans , and for many across the globe , it is impossible to watch Oscar Pistorius run without a stir of emotion , without wanting to break down and cry and shout with joy .
Pistorius is no ordinary hero : he is that rare thing , a man with an almost - impossible narrative .
It is not a rags to riches story , a poor boy made good –
we have many of those here and on the African continent .
His story is more intense .
To be without legs , and to become the epitome of excellence in the very field where you are not supposed to excel : that is the stuff of legends .
That is why many of us here , when talking about Pistorius , take on the hyperbole of sportswriters .
We like an impossible story .
And we loved him for it .
We adored him .
Black or white , athletics - loving or not , his was a story that inspired a country that is quick to cleave along racial lines .
He shattered those barriers .
He was just what he was :
the Blade Runner , the hero .
As a testament to his place in our psyche , on our roads massive billboards smiled down on us , reminding us of the man who had achieved the impossible .
It is the stuff of goosebumps .
Those billboards were being pulled down on Thursday .
Pistorius , hero , had gone from being a figure of sympathy in the morning – when stories went viral that the shooting of a woman at his house may have been a case of mistaken identity – to being accused of murder in the evening as police revealed there were reports of shouting at his house the evening before .
It is all too early to tell .
The story changed by the hour over the day , and will continue to change as Pistorius makes a first appearance in court on Friday and investigations continue .
We will not know whether he is guilty or innocent for some months yet .
What we do know is that a hero is fallen , and on Thursday you could see the effect of that on South Africa .
Political animals like me forgot , for hours on end , that the president of the country was about to give his state of the nation address in the evening ; lovers turned away from soppy Valentine 's Day celebrations .
It was Oscar all the way .
Why , though ?
There have always been niggling , worrying features to Pistorius .
At the London Olympics last year , when he behaved in an unsportsmanlike manner towards another athlete and shocked many , we were reminded of his flaws .
On Thursday , many were mining his Twitter account and past newspaper reports about him .
There was the gun by the bedside and the rifle by the window seen by British journalists years ago .
There was the tweet describing how he walked into his house , thought there was a burglar and went into "" recon mode "" .
There was the drinking and the short temper .
In the morning , though , when the story first broke , there was no touching Pistorius .
His model girlfriend – a sign of status among jock sportsmen – was coming in to give him a Valentine 's surprise , went the story .
Many would not dare contemplate the alternative .
It reminds one how we South Africans refused to believe that Hansie Cronje could be anything other than the gentleman cricketer so many thought he was .
In a country of very few heroes , particularly those who transcend the always - present colour line , we do not want them to flicker and die .
So we clung to that narrative .
The truth , however , is that South Africa is a country of violence .
We have often been labelled the "" crime capital of the world "" , and many like Pistorius own firearms , supposedly to protect themselves from burglars and robbers .
Last week , the country was in mourning after a 17-year - old girl died after being gang - raped .
It is who we are .
Perhaps that is why we struggled to accept that "" one of us "" might have pulled the trigger – with tragic consequences .
Worse , he is not just one of us .
When our Olympics team was in the doldrums at the Games , we knew one truth : Pistorius would redeem us .
He ran his guts out , and did .
Now he is fallen , and we are lost ."
2013-02-14,"The South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius has been charged with the murder of his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , who died of gunshot wounds at his home on Thursday morning .
Officials in Pretoria said Pistorius , 26 , was due to appear at a correctional services police court at 2 pm local time but the case was later delayed until Friday .
A police spokeswoman , Denise Beukes , said ( video ) earlier reports that the suspect had been surprised by his girlfriend and had thought she was an intruder had not come from police . ""
The South Africa police service were just as surprised this morning to hear on the radio that allegations had been made that the deceased had been perceived to be a burglar .
We were very surprised and those allegations did not come from us . ""
Beukes said witnesses and neighbours claim to have heard unusual sounds on Wednesday evening and when the shooting took place .
There had "" previously been allegations of a domestic nature at Mr Pistorius 's home "" , she said , adding that Pistorius was being "" treated like any other normal person "" . ""
He will be bringing a bail application and we will be opposing bail .
"" There were no other suspects in the case .
Earlier , police said they had launched a murder investigation after a 30-year - old woman was found dead in the upmarket Silver Lakes gated community , where the Paralympic and Olympic runner lives .
It is believed she was shot four times .
There was speculation in the local media that Pistorius may have mistaken his girlfriend for a burglar and the shooting could have been the result of a Valentine 's Day surprise gone wrong .
Lieutenant Colonel Katlego Mogale , a police spokeswoman , said : "" Currently there are wild stories going around in the media , "" she said .
"" We are collecting evidence and will be guided by that evidence . ""
Pistorius 's father said his son was sad after the shooting .
"" I do n't know nothing , "" Henke Pistorius told SABC radio news .
"" It will be extremely obnoxious and rude to speculate .
I do n't know the facts .
If anyone makes a statement , it will have to be Oscar .
He 's sad at the moment . ""
Steenkamp , a well - known South African model , had been dating Pistorius since November and was due to appear in a reality TV show called Tropika Island of Treasure .
The law graduate from Port Elizabeth gave an interview to the Sunday Times in South Africa last week in which she described her boyfriend as "" an impeccable man who always has her best interests at heart "" .
She had featured in the South African edition of FHM magazine .
Hagen Engler , its former editor , said he had known her since around the age of 15 in Port Elizabeth , where they grew up .
"" She was the face of Avon or something like that , "" he said .
"" She was an amazing girl , a really intelligent person . ""
She was a businesswoman as well
and I think she had a law degree .
She went into the modelling industry and had a mature understanding of it .
She had a good sense of humour , like a guy 's sense of humour .
She was determined to succeed in the world of modelling and she really worked at it . ""
Engler , a freelance journalist , said he had not seen her with Pistorius : "" When the newspapers started saying Oscar Pistorius was going out with her , it was like : ' That 's my girl . '
But I 'm no expert on her relationship status . ""
Her death came as a huge shock , he said .
"" It 's a hammerblow .
It was like : ' I know her , oh my God ' .
I 've been trying to process it .
It 's a real tragedy that such a bright girl has gone . ""
A spokesperson for the magazine said : "" FHM was shocked and saddened to learn of the tragic passing of FHM cover girl Reeva Steenkamp .
Our thoughts go out to her family and friends during this difficult and painful time .
FHM knew Reeva as a beautiful , intelligent and warm - hearted woman who was a joy to work with and everyone at FHM mourns her untimely passing .
May she rest in peace . ""
South Africa 's Sports Confederation and Olympic committee ( Sascoc ) said in a statement it had been inundated with requests for comment but were not in a position to give out any details of the shooting . ""
Sascoc , like the rest of the public , knows no more than what is in the public domain …
The organisation is in no position to comment on the incident other than to say our deepest sympathy and condolences have been expressed to the families of all concerned . ""
Pistorius , known as Blade Runner because of the carbon - fibre prosthetic blades he wears to race , is one of the world 's best - known Paralympic stars .
He was born without fibulas in both legs , which were amputated when he was 11 months .
He made history at London 2012 when he became the first double amputee to run in both the Olympics and Paralympics , racing in the 400 m and 4x400 m relay at the Olympics .
The Johannesburg - born athlete won a legal battle over his blades with the International Association of Athletics Federations in 2008 for the right to compete in able - bodied competition ."
2013-02-14,
2013-02-14,"Oscar Pistorius , the Paralympic star and inspiration to millions around the world , was contemplating his future from a police cell on Thursday night after being charged with murdering his girlfriend ( video ) .
In a drama that stunned South Africa and admirers abroad , Pistorius allegedly fired four bullets into Reeva Steenkamp 's head , chest and arm at his home in the capital , Pretoria , in the early hours of Thursday morning .
The life of the glamorous athlete , known as the Blade Runner for his hi - tech artificial legs , has been one of world sport 's defining narratives of triumph over adversity , culminating in his appearance at the both the Olympics and Paralympics in London last year .
Yet as the 26-year - old prepared to answer a murder charge and apply for bail at Pretoria magistrates court on Friday morning , a picture emerged of a man with a playboy lifestyle , an intense interest in guns and a taste for living dangerously , suggesting that the world did not know Pistorius as well as it thought .
Steenkamp , 29 , a model whose face graced the covers of glossy magazines , had only been dating him for a few months .
On Twitter she had written of her excitement about Valentine 's Day . ""
What do you have up your sleeve for your love tomorrow ? ? ?
"" she tweeted . ""
…
It should be a day of love for everyone :) may it be blessed ! ""
Last week she told South Africa 's Sunday Times her boyfriend was "" an impeccable man who always has her best interests at heart "" .
She had been due to give a motivational talk to school pupils on Thursday , while this weekend she will be seen in a reality TV series , Tropika Island Of Treasure , in which celebrities and ordinary people compete in remote , exotic locations in a variety of daily challenges .
News broadcasts showed footage of her being interviewed in Jamaica to promote the series , which producers said would be broadcast as planned .
The model 's uncle , Mike Steenkamp , told eNews Channel Africa : "" I must just say that her future has been cut short .
The family are devastated .
"" How it pans out , at the end of the day we will all know the true story .
We must never forget what Reeva stood for .
She loved people , she loved everybody , her heart went out .
At least we know exactly what she accomplished in the past . ""
He added : "" It 's a devastating shock .
Her whole life , what she could achieve , never came to fulfilment .
I hope she 's with the angels . ""
Steenkamp was shot at around 3 am in Pistorius 's house in an exclusive gated community .
Police said paramedics were already at the scene by the time they arrived and Steenkamp was pronounced dead .
A 9 mm pistol was recovered and there was soon yellow police tape around the grey modern two - storey house , along with crosses marking each door .
Officers said the couple were the only people in the house at the time and there were no signs of forced entry .
They added that neighbours heard "" screaming and shouting "" around the time of the shooting , and that police had been called to investigate incidents of a "" domestic nature "" at the house in the past .
In 2009 Pistorius was arrested and spent the night at a police station after a 19-year - old woman accused him of assault .
No charges were brought due to lack of evidence .
Shashi Naidoo , the owner of Alushi Model Management in Johannesburg , said she knew both Pistorius and Steenkamp and had seen them together a few times .
"" They were extremely happy , "" she recalled .
"" There did n't seem to be any drama
but you do n't know what goes on behind closed doors . ""
Oscar makes a great first impression .
He comes over as friendly and engaging .
He 's a national hero and Reeva is known in her own right .
It 's a huge shock as they seemed the perfect couple . ""
Naidoo admitted that her faith in Pistorius had been shaken .
"" Oscar has had previous charges against him but we always thought he was a good guy .
We thought it was people making something out of nothing , as happens to famous people .
We did n't believe it . ""
The news service eNews Channel Africa said it understood Pistorius had told police it was a "" horrible accident "" and would plead in court that he mistook Steenkamp for a burglar .
Such incidents are not unknown in a country where crime is high and fear of crime even higher .
In 2004 , for example , the rugby player Rudi Visagie shot dead his 19-year - old daughter after he mistakenly thought she was a robber trying to steal his car in the middle of the night .
But police have played down the theory in this case .
After questioning on Thursday , Pistorius left a police station accompanied by officers .
He looked down as photographers took pictures , the hood on his grey sweatshirt pulled up , concealing most of his face .
Sources said Pistorius had requested the court hearing to take place as soon as possible .
But it was postponed until Friday to give forensic investigators time to carry out their work , said Medupe Simasiku , a spokesman for the prosecution .
Pistorius 's father said his son was sad following the shooting .
"" I do n't know nothing , "" Henke Pistorius told SABC radio news .
"" It will be extremely obnoxious and rude to speculate .
I do n't know the facts .
If anyone makes a statement , it will have to be Oscar .
He 's sad at the moment .
"" Pistorius 's former coach Andrea Gianni said he hoped it was "" just a tragic accident "" .
He told the Associated Press in Italy : "" No matter how bad the situation was , Oscar always stayed calm and positive .
Whenever he was tired or nervous he was still extremely nice to people .
I never saw him violent . ""
Six months ago Pistorius – who had both his legs amputated below the knee before his first birthday because of a congenital condition – made history when he became the first double - amputee track athlete to compete in the Olympics .
He was named by Time magazine last year as one of the world 's 100 most influential people .
Yet his compelling story has been undercut by a personal life of tabloid fodder .
In February 2009 he crashed a speed boat on South Africa 's Vaal river , breaking his nose , jaw and several ribs .
Witnesses said he had been drinking before the crash and officers found alcohol in the wreckage , though they acknowledged they had not conducted a blood test on Pistorius .
In November last year a newspaper claimed Pistorius "" threatened to break the legs "" of the friend of a man whom he believed had slept with his then girlfriend .
The police became involved before the dispute was eventually resolved .
His colourful love life is never far from the gossip columns .
Recent media interviews with Pistorius revealed that he kept an assortment of weapons in his home . ""
Cricket and baseball bats lay behind the door , a pistol by his bed and a machine gun by a window , "" Britain 's Daily Mail noted in a profile .
Pistorius posted a photograph of himself at a shooting range in November 2011 on Twitter , boasting about his score : "" Had a 96 % headshot over 300 m from 50shots !
Bam ! ""
Pistorius enjoyed target shooting with his pistol and an online Nike advertisement featuring the sprinter read : "" I am a bullet in the chamber . ""
The advert was removed from his website on Thursday .
An article in January last year in the New York Times magazine described him talking about how he drew a pistol to search his home when his alarm went off the night before an interview .
At Pistorius 's suggestion , he and the journalist went to a nearby target range where they fired at targets with a 9 mm pistol .
At one point Pistorius told the writer : "" If you practised , I think you could be pretty deadly . ""
Asked how often he went target shooting , Pistorius replied : "" Just sometimes when I ca n't sleep . ""
In a message posted on Twitter on 27 November last year , Pistorius wrote : "" Nothing like getting home to hear the washing machine on and thinking its an intruder to go into full combat recon mode into the pantry ! ""
The incident reignited South Africa 's own debate about gun control .
Pistorius is far from alone in owning a firearm in what is one of the world 's most violent societies , where on average 43 people are murdered a day .
Some commentators argue that gated communities , such as Silver Woods where Pistorius lives , are bastions of privilege that actively feed an "" us and them "" mentality of fear and paranoia .
In 2009 Silver Woods , built around a golf course , was voted "" the most secure estate in South Africa "" , according to its website .
It has a three - metre - high wall , electrified fences , armed 24-hour security guards and manned , controlled access ."

2013-02-14,"The sports brand
Nike has an unfortunate history of associating with athletes who attract adverse publicity , and has been criticised for its slow reaction to crises .
However , its advertisement on Oscar Pistorius ' official website that read "" I am the bullet in the chamber "" was removed on Thursday afternoon following the South African 's arrest and subsequent charge for murder .
Lance Armstrong
Despite initially indicating that it would stand by Armstrong , Nike dropped the disgraced cyclist after it emerged that the American had been running , in the words of US Anti - Doping Agency , "" the most sophisticated , professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen "" .
Initially the company said : "" Lance has stated his innocence and has been unwavering on this position .
Nike plans to continue to support Lance and the Lance Armstrong Foundation , a foundation that Lance created to serve cancer survivors .
"" The company later said that Armstrong had misled them , and dropped him in the face of "" seemingly insurmountable evidence "" .
Tiger Woods
The former world No1 ranked golfer 's career took a spectacular nosedive in November 2009 when revelations about his extra - marital affairs spread like wildfire , causing Woods to take a break from the sport and later apologise live on TV .
A number of sponsors including Accenture , AT&amp;T , Gatorade and General Motors cut their links with Woods , while Gillette suspended his advertisements .
However , Nike , along with Electronic Arts , kept the faith and has recently released a new advert where he appears alongside the current No1 , Rory McIlroy .
Marion Jones Nike did not immediately drop the former American sprinter when she became linked with the Balco drug scandal , but it did not renew her sponsorship contract in 2005 .
Jones later tested positive for the blood - boosting agent EPO and in 2007 admitted lying to federal agents about her use of performance - enhancing drugs , spending six months in prison the following year .
Justin Gatlin Gatlin won the 100 m gold at the 2004 Athens Olympics but later tested positive for testosterone and was banned from athletics for four years .
Nike suspended his contract and severed ties with him .
Michael Vick
The American footballer served 18 months in prison after pleading guilty to bankrolling a dogfighting operation in 2007 .
Once the highest - paid player in the NFL , Nike dropped him the moment he was convicted , later re - signing the quarterback after he was released from prison ."
2013-02-14,"Often awe - inspiring , sometimes controversial , the image of Oscar Pistorius bestrode London 's Olympic and Paralympic summer .
As the first global Paralympic superstar , his feats on the track , allied to a gregarious personality and some canny image building , have made him a multi - millionaire and one of the world 's most recognisable sportsmen off it .
Not only has he transcended the world of the Paralympics , even while helping the movement grow to unprecedented heights , Pistorius is one of a rare handful of athletes to transcend the world of sport .
From the moment it was confirmed that he would become the first double amputee to compete in both the Olympic and Paralympic Games , his place in history was assured .
But few could have predicted just how integral he would become to the narrative of London 's Games .
For many , the sight of him swapping race numbers with the eventual gold medallist Kirani James after their 400 m semi - final was one of the images of the Olympics .
With the eyes of the world on Pistorius following a typically eloquent press conference on the eve of the Games , his Paralympics did not exactly run according to script .
The 26-year - old ignited a huge controversy and accusations of sour grapes after he sparked a row over the length of blades that should be allowed immediately after being beaten by the Brazilian Alan Oliveira in the 200 m .
In an epic 100 m final , to deafening roars , he was defeated by Britain 's Jonnie Peacock .
But he still came away with two gold medals , in the 400 m and 4x100 m relay , to add to the hat - trick of golds he won in Beijing .
And while he apologised for the timing of his comments over Oliveira 's blades , he stuck by his central point that the International Paralympics Committee had not done enough to standardise the length allowed .
Other athletes rallied to his cause , but the South African 's case was somewhat undermined by the fact that he was left to rely on his shorter blades because they were the ones he had permission from the IAAF to run on in able - bodied competition .
Having argued that his dominance was down to his ability alone rather than technology , he now appeared to be acknowledging the opposite .
It was shortly before that Beijing Games that the debate over whether his prosthetic blades conferred an advantage over non - disabled runners became a huge talking point .
He was initially banned from non - disabled competition by the International Association of Athletics Federations , but the ban was overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport .
After taking expert advice , it ruled that the IAAF had failed to take into account the disadvantages Pistorius experienced in running with blades , which broadly balanced out any benefit .
Pistorius has also consistently argued that he has been wearing the same Flex‑Foot Cheetah blades for nearly a decade , proving his improved performances and times were down to hard work and training rather than technology .
The sprinter failed to qualify for the Beijing Olympics , but ran in the South African 4x400 m relay team at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu , South Korea , amid huge media interest .
Although he ran in both the heats and the semi - finals , he was not selected for the final , where his team - mates went on to win a silver medal .
Born without fibulae , Pistorius had both legs amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old .
Encouraged by his mother , a key influence in his life who died when he was 15 , Pistorius was urged to make the most of his ability rather than focus on his disability , competing alongside non - disabled athletes in a range of sports from an early age .
He has often quoted from a letter , written by his mother when he had his legs amputated and intended to be read in later life : "" The real loser is never the person who crosses the finishing line last .
The real loser is the person who sits on the side .
The person who does not even try to compete . ""
He came to athletics late , starting to compete in 2004 after a serious rugby injury left him looking for an alternative sport at 17 .
His natural talent and explosive speed were obvious immediately and he set a new world record of 11.51 seconds in the 100 m at a meeting in his native Pretoria after just two months of training .
At the Athens Paralympics , he won a gold and a bronze and set his sights on competing against non - disabled athletes .
But it was the four - year period between Beijing and London that catapulted him to the position of one of the biggest names in world sport as he spent a significant amount of time crisscrossing the globe on behalf of a growing band of sponsors and corporate backers .
Pistorius has also used his profile to boost causes close to his heart , including the Mineseeker Foundation for those injured by landmines .
Amid all that , he never lost sight of his London goal – redoubling his efforts in training and taking the best advice available on nutrition and performance .
In his native South Africa , he is considered one of the country 's biggest sporting heroes and his ability to bridge the worlds of disabled and non - disabled sport , as well as his eloquence in fostering a shift in attitude among those confronted with his talent , have seen him twice named in Time magazine 's list of the 100 most influential people in the world .
Pistorius ' success in defending his 400 m title on the last day of the London Paralympics provided a fitting coda to an event that had surpassed all expectations as he reflected on a draining , unforgettable , summer .
Perhaps inevitably , it was Pistorius who personified many of the issues around the London Paralympics – from the vastly increased profile that has made him one of the most recognisable sportsmen on the planet to the complex debates about classification and technology that the movement now has to wrestle with .
"" The beauty of life is that you 're always learning .
It 's easy to be gracious when you win , but to be humble when you lose is not so easy
and I 've had to learn that , "" he said after helping the South Africans to gold in the 4x100 m .
In his 26 years , Pistorius has already led a life more dramatic than most three times his age .
He could not have known then the further tragic , dramatic turn it would take just five months later ."

2013-02-15,"As online debate raged in the UK on Friday over the Sun 's coverage of Oscar Pistorius – its front page features a huge photo of his dead girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , in a bikini – it emerged that a former editor of the News International tabloid turned celebrity PR , Stuart Higgins , has flown to Pretoria to help him to manage the media .
Higgins , who edited the Sun from 1994 to 1998 , gave PR support to Pistorius during the London 2012 Games .
His agency , Stuart Higgins Communications , set up in 1999 , specialises in talent and crisis management and has a strong client list from the sporting world , including Chelsea FC and Manchester United .
He has also represented several international athletes , swimmers and tennis players , including Andy Murray .
In 2007 , Higgins sold the company to Fast Track , a subsidiary of Chime Communications , formerly chaired by Lord Bell .
Higgins , a former royal correspondent at the Sun , was the butt of editor Kelvin MacKenzie 's anger and jokes during his time as news editor and then deputy editor in the 1980s .
MacKenzie published a front page , featuring Higgins as "" The Human Sponge "" , and printed his direct phone line , asking readers to ring him to get things off their chest ."
2013-02-15,"The Sun came under sustained fire on Friday because of its front page , which reported the arrest of Oscar Pistorius by running a huge picture of his dead girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in a bikini .
Hundreds of people aired their complaints on Twitter about the image of Steenkamp , arguing that it was both sexist and tasteless .
Among those who condemned the paper were former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott and Labour MP Chris Bryant , who tweeted : "" This is a simply despicable front page .
It glories in domestic violence .
@rupertmurdoch apologise .
"" Prescott 's tweet said : "" I really hope every member of the shadow cabinet thinks twice before writing for the Sun after that front page . ""
Among the feminist complainants was the newspaper columnist Suzanne Moore who argued that the Sun had hit "" a new low "" .
She called it "" lechery over a corpse , "" adding : "" A woman just murdered ?
I hope mass boycott . ""
Bryant continued his attack in further tweets , urging his followers to complain to the Sun 's editor , Dominic Mohan .
One of them , Chelsey Sanderson , pointed out that the Sun had taken "" the moral high ground "" by refusing to publish the picture of a pregnant Duchess of Cambridge in a bikini but had dared to publish a murder victim in her bikini .
She added : "" Words fail me . ""
One of the most damning tweets was posted by a journalist , Ben Bold , who accused the Sun of "" doing what it does best : flaunting its egregious lack of judgement , decency etc "" .
Many callers to Victoria Derbyshire 's BBC Radio 5 Live programme on Friday expressed their outrage , with few people willing to defend the paper .
But the Sun 's former deputy editor , Neil Wallis , spoke up for his former newspaper in a series of tweets .
One said that the storm over the Sun page one "" is totally fake "" and contended it was the result of complaints from "" the usual suspects who never read the paper anyway . ""
RG comment :
What do people expect of the Sun ?
Sure , its front page is tasteless .
Yes , it is also sexist .
But the paper is like that every day in every way .
There is , of course , no harm in taking the opportunity to point it out .
But I suspect the complainers are talking to the converted ; in other words , people who do n't read the Sun regularly , if at all ( Wallis is surely right about that ) .
Some 7 million people are estimated to read each copy of the Sun and , though the numbers are decreasing , it remains Britain 's most popular paper .
The figures may be disheartening to those who believe in better , particularly those who loathe sexism , but it 's obvious , if sad , that it is deeply embedded in working class culture .
So a large slice of the British population just does n't view the Sun 's content ( or the Daily Star 's for that matter ) in terms of sexism , which takes us back to that page 3 debate again .
As for taste , it is always in the eye of the beholder .
So complain away .
Argue the case .
Embarrass Rupert Murdoch .
But also understand that cultural change takes time .
One bright fact to note : The Sun and the Daily Star used to sell , between them , more than twice as many copies as they do now .
That 's progress , is it not ?"

2013-02-15,"Hands clasped to his face , his torment laid bare in a humid redbrick courtroom , Oscar Pistorius was back at the centre of the crowd 's gaze .
Six months ago he was watched by millions as he sprinted down the track of London 's Olympic Stadium .
On Friday Pistorius stood in the dock a broken man , facing a charge of murdering his girlfriend .
The double - amputee athlete , nicknamed Blade Runner , was making his first court appearance since the multiple shooting at his home that left the 29-year - old model Reeva Steenkamp dead .
Pistorius denied murder "" in the strongest terms "" , his family and management made clear in a statement , offering their "" deepest sympathy "" to Steenkamp 's family .
Inside the packed courtroom in Pretoria all eyes turned as Pistorius , his hair short and neat , entered wearing a grey suit and blue tie .
He quickly broke down , putting his fingers over his eyes , his trauma reflected in the faces of watching photographers . ""
Take it easy , "" the chief magistrate Desmond Nair told him . ""
Come take a seat . ""
As proceedings continued , Pistorius repeatedly lost his composure .
When the magistrate used the phase "" premeditated murder "" the athlete slumped forward as if trying to bend over double , his head bowed , sobbing and shaking uncontrollably .
He remained inconsolable and silent throughout , a lonely man in a crowded room .
Pistorius 's father , Henke , was in court , as was his brother Carl , sister Aimee and other supporters .
At one point Henke leaned forward and placed a comforting hand on Pistorius 's back ; at another , Carl put a hand on his shoulder , prompting Pistorius 's head to turn slightly .
Nair announced the case as "" the state versus Mr Oscar Leonard Pistorius "" , involving a charge of one count of murder .
The prosecution indicated it would file the more serious charge of premeditated murder .
Pistorius could face life in prison if found guilty .
Nair presided over the near hour - long hearing in a courtroom crammed with more than 100 people , including numerous local and international journalists .
The magistrate ruled that no recordings of court proceedings would be allowed in the case .
The hearing was relatively informal , with attendees wearing T - shirts and jeans , and journalists frequently tweeting from phones .
One man in a yellow football shirt held a crime docket marked "" GBH "" and "" beer bottle "" .
The magistrate delayed Pistorius 's bail hearing until Tuesday and ruled that the 26-year - old would be held at a Pretoria police station until then .
It is more common for the accused to be detained in prison .
Steenkamp was found shot dead in Pistorius 's home in a heavily guarded , gated complex in the northern outskirts of Pretoria .
South African media reports suggest Pistorius may have mistaken Steenkamp for an intruder , but police said neighbours had heard shouting and screaming before the shots and there had been previous "" domestic "" incidents at the house .
The Afrikaans - language Beeld newspaper said Steenkamp was shot four times , in the head , chest , pelvis and hand . ""
The security guards found Pistorius by Steenkamp 's body in the bathroom , "" the paper said , citing a neighbour . ""
The door had bullet holes right through it . ""
Police have not disclosed details and there has been no verification of the claim .
Pistorius 's family and management company issued a statement making clear that he intends to fight the charge . ""
Firstly , and most importantly , all our thoughts today must be with the family and friends of Reeva Steenkamp , "" the statement said .
"" Oscar Pistorius has appeared in court here in Pretoria this morning formally charged with the murder of Reeva Steenkamp .
The alleged murder is disputed in the strongest terms .
"" It added : "" Oscar Pistorius has made history as an Olympic and Paralympic sportsman and has been an inspiration to others the world over .
He has made it very clear that he would like to send his deepest sympathies to the family of Reeva . ""
He would also like to express his thanks through us today for all the messages of support he has received – but as stated , our thoughts and prayers today should be for Reeva and her family , regardless of the circumstances of this terrible , terrible tragedy . ""
The defence lawyer Kenny Oldwage said his client was in an "" extremely traumatised state of mind "" .
Stuart Higgins , a former editor the Sun and now a PR consultant , has flown out to South Africa to help co - ordinate the Pistorius family 's media strategy .
Earlier Pistorius was led by officers to a police van outside the Boschkop police station in eastern Pretoria , where he had been questioned on Thursday and had spent the night in custody .
A policeman was seen carrying a handgun in a plastic forensic bag outside the Boschkop station .
It was believed to be the 9 mm pistol used to shoot and kill Steenkamp .
When Pistorius arrived at court in the back of a police vehicle , he hid his face with a jacket and pressed an A4 notebook to the window .
The case has stunned a nation that revered "" the fastest man on no legs "" as an inspiration who managed to compete at the highest levels of sport despite being born without a fibula in either leg .
South Africa 's M - Net cable TV channel pulled adverts featuring Pistorius off air but most of his sponsors , including Nike , said they would not make any decisions until the police investigation was completed .
Pistorius 's endorsements and sponsorships , which also include BT , Oakley and the French designer Thierry Mugler , are thought to be worth as much as $ 2 m a year .
Acquaintances of Pistorius , including a former girlfriend , spoke out on social media .
Trish Taylor , mother of Pistorius 's ex - girlfriend Samantha Taylor , wrote on Facebook : "" I 'm so glad Sammy is safe and out of the clutches of that man . ""
Another ex - girlfriend , Jenna Edkins , defended Pistorius on Twitter .
"" All I am saying is let him speak , let his side be heard without jumping to conclusions , "" Edkins wrote .
She offered "" love and support "" to the Pistorius family and added : "" I have dated Oscar on and off for 5 YEARS , NOT ONCE has he EVER lifted a finger to me or made me fear for my life . ""
Police said investigators had conducted an autopsy on Steenkamp 's body but the results would not be published .
A memorial service will be held in her home city , Port Elizabeth , on Tuesday .
Producers of a pre - recorded reality TV show , Tropika Island of Treasure , in which she appears said that after "" much deliberation "" they had decided to go ahead with the broadcast on Saturday ."
2013-02-15,"Paralympian Oscar Pistorius has denied murdering his girlfriend in the "" strongest terms "" and offered his "" deepest sympathies "" to her family .

Pistorius , 26 , broke down and wept uncontrollably in court as prosecutors said they would pursue a charge of premeditated murder against him .
He is accused of shooting dead Steenkamp , a model and reality TV show participant , at his home in the early hours of Thursday morning .
It has been claimed that Pistorius will plead he mistook her for a burglar , and a South Africa media report on Friday reported he shot four times through a bathroom door .
Police have not disclosed details and there has been no verification of the claim .

At one point Henke leaned forward and placed a comforting hand on Pistorius 's back ; at another , Carl put a hand on his shoulder .
Controversial South African businessman Kenny Kunene , wearing sunglasses , was also present , saying he had come to support his friend Pistorius .
The hearing was relatively informal with court attendees wearing T - shirts and jeans , and journalists frequently tweeting from phones .
Yet the man in the dock was evidently inconsolable .
The magistrate delayed Pistorius 's bail hearing until Tuesday and ruled the 26-year - old would be held at a Pretoria police station until then , despite a likely perception of "" preferential treatment "" , as it would be more common for the accused to be detained in prison .
Family members reached forward to touch Pistorius 's shoulder as he stood and left the courtroom while cameras clicked and flashed .
The Paralympic champion had arrived at court earlier in the back of a police vehicle , hiding his face with a jacket and A4 notebook pressed to the window .
Forensic experts are expected to continue examining the house in the upmarket estate on the outskirts of Pretoria where Steenkamp , 29 , was killed .
Pistorius made history in London last year when he became the first double - amputee track athlete to compete in the Olympic Games as well as the Paralympic Games .
The tragedy dominated South African TV , radio and newspapers , with the Times front page headline stating : "" Oscar 's darkest day "" .
Stuart Higgins , a former editor of the Sun and now a PR consultant , has flown out to South Africa to help co - ordinate the Pistorius family 's media strategy ."
2013-02-15,"The coverage of the alleged murder by Oscar Pistorius of Reeva Steenkamp highlights the difficulty of enforcing rights to a fair trial in the age of social media .
No sooner had news of the violent death of Steenkamp and Pistorius 's involvement emerged than , depressingly and rather predictably , the jokes started on Twitter .
Very soon after that though came the speculation about motive : analysis of any defence and examination of previous behaviour by Pistorius .
We had , verdict , mitigation and aggravating circumstances all wrapped up in a morning on Twitter .
This rush to analyse , explain and condemn has consequences for mainstream coverage of such events , as one can see from Friday morning 's papers .
It is simply not enough to report the terrible event any more : readers need their papers to provide background and context which they will go looking for on the web if they can not find it in print .
So for example , this morning 's Daily Mirror carries an interview with the mother of an ex - girlfriend speaking of her relief that her daughter was out of the relationship .
The Sun reports an alleged obsession with guns and previous threatening behaviour and an extraordinary shot - by - shot account of the killing on its front page .
The Times and Daily Telegraph detail his supposedly fiery temper and the Daily Mail carries a report about "" The Dark Side of the Blade Runner "" .
The Guardian carries a lengthy editorial detailing his "" fall "" , although we are a long way from trial .
South Africa is a common law jurisdiction like the UK and it has similar contempt laws .
The crucial difference is that jury trials were abolished there in 1969 and Pistorius will be tried by a judge alone .
This gives publishers and tweeters some reassurance .
It has always been assumed that judges , unlike jurors , are above the influence of the media , whether it is on Twitter or in the pages of the papers .
So contempt should not be a problem in South Africa .
But libel could be – either in South Africa , or possibly the UK .
It is worth noting that the UK media 's coverage of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann did not stop her parents securing substantial libel damages from a number of news organisations , even though the events they were reporting on took place in Portugal .
What if the killing of Steenkamp had happened in the UK , or in any other country with a jury system ?
Do we believe that Twitter , or the mainstream media would have been any more restrained in their coverage ?
Perhaps not .
It would seem now that some crimes transcend the law and trying to control coverage of them is like trying to hold back the tide , an impossibility .
The Law Commission is currently reviewing the law of contempt in the UK and one of the powers it has suggested would allow judges to order removal of online material .
The judge would have to specify which URLs were to be disabled for the duration of a trial .
Imagine if one tried to track down the prejudicial URLs circulating about Pistorius ?
It would be an impossible task .
The Pistorius case shows the difficulty in a balancing the right to a fair trial with the sort of freedom of expression allowed by global social media , especially where the defendant , or victim , is a world - famous figure .

David Smith has just sent this report of this morning 's proceedings : The Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius broke down and wept uncontrollably in court today as prosecutors said they would pursue a charge of premeditated murder against him .
The South African athlete , dubbed the "" blade runner "" , repeatedly pressed his fingers to his eyes and looked down , sobbing and shaking , during the hour - long hearing in a packed courtroom in Pretoria .
Pistorius is accused of shooting dead his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , a model and reality TV show participant , at his home in a gated community in the early hours of Thursday morning .
The magistrate delayed Pistorius 's bail hearing until next Tuesday and Wednesday , and ruled that the 26-year - old would be held at a Pretoria police station until then .
He did so despite the possible perception of "" preferential treatment "" as it would be more common for the accused to be detained in prison .
Pistorius had solemnly entered the court wearing a grey suit and blue tie .
He quickly broke down , pressing his fingers to his eyes , his trauma reflected in the faces of watching photographers .
As proceedings continued , Pistorius repeatedly lost his composure .
At one point , when the magistrate used the phase "" premeditated murder "" , the athlete leaned forward as if trying to bend over double , his head in his hands , shaking and sobbing .
The South African website News24 has picked up on the Sun 's decision to use what it terms a "" gratuitous "" picture of Reeva Steenkamp on the front of some editions of today 's paper .
The move has attracted criticism on Twitter - as has the Daily Mail 's decision to run a series of pictures of Steenkamp in a bikini .
The photo featured on The Sun 's front page is of the 30-year - old model in a pink bikini which was taken for her cover of men 's magazine FHM in December 2011 .
The behind - the - scenes video of the photo shoot was taken off of Youtube on Thursday morning .
The Sun 's front page uses the phrases "" blade runner "" , "" valentine 's horror "" and the words "" shots "" and "" screams "" , but her name is not mentioned , even though her photo takes up more than half of the cover .
Many users took to Twitter to express disgust at The Sun 's front page under the collective hashtag # HerNameWasReevaSteenkamp .
The prosecution has told the court that it will argue that Pistorius committed premeditated murder when he allegedly shot his girlfriend dead .
Just to sum up , the judge in the case has agreed to the defence 's request that a bail hearing be postponed until next Tuesday .
Until then , Pistorius will be kept at a police station in Brooklyn , Pretoria .
Pistorius has now left the court .
Here 's a quick wrap of the proceedings so far from Reuters :
Oscar Pistorius , a double amputee who became one of the biggest names in world athletics , broke down in tears on Friday after being formally charged in a Pretoria court with the murder of his girlfriend .
Dressed in a dark suit , the 26-year - old Olympic and Paralympic superstar stood with head bowed in front of magistrate Desmond Nair to the hear the charge of one count of murder read out .
He then started sobbing , covering his face with his hands . ""
Take it easy .
Come take a seat , "" Nair told him .
Pistorius was held overnight in a Pretoria police station .
On Friday morning , he was led , flanked by family members and officers , to a police station wagon to be taken to the capital 's central magistrate 's court .
The hearing was delayed for two hours as his defence lawyers objected to the scrum of local and international reporters packed into the courtroom .
In case you 've missed it , here 's a flavour of Justice Malala 's reflections on Pistorius and his place in South African society .
For us South Africans , and for many across the globe , it is impossible to watch Oscar Pistorius run without a stir of emotion , without wanting to break down and cry and shout with joy .
Pistorius is no ordinary hero : he is that rare thing , a man with an almost - impossible narrative .
It is not a rags to riches story , a poor boy made good –
we have many of those here and on the African continent .
His story is more intense .
To be without legs , and to become the epitome of excellence in the very field where you are not supposed to excel : that is the stuff of legends .
That is why many of us here , when talking about Pistorius , take on the hyperbole of sportswriters .
We like an impossible story ...
David Smith - who 's also tweeting ( @SmithInAfrica ) - has just sent this from the court :
Oscar Pistorius arrived at Pretoria magistrates court in a police vehicle , sitting in the backseat rather than the unpleasant holding section for prisoners .
He pressed a dark jacket and A4 notepad to the window to avoid chasing photographers .
I 'm now inside court C , a redbrick courtroom with a South African national flag and , behind the judge 's black leather chair , a coat of arms .
The public gallery is packed , on five rows of wooden benches , with many more standing in the wings .
It 's a colourful mix with numerous journalists and few suits and ties .
One man is wearing a yellow football shirt and jeans and holding a docket for a case of GBH involving a beer bottle .
But an official has just announced that this court will hear the Pistorius case only .
I spoke to a young white man with short dark hair , checked shirt and chinos who said he 's married to Pistorius 's cousin .
"" I only know what you know , from the papers , "" he said , declining to comment further .
There was a huge gaggle of photographers and cameramen gathered at the courtroom steps , which Pistorius is expected to ascend quite soon .
An official ordered them out , but three TV cameras remain .
To give some wider context , Afua Hirsch has been looking at crime rates and gun ownership in South Africa , where there are estimated to be 12 guns for every 100 citizens , earning the country 17th place in a world league of gun ownership .
Many people say they live in fear of crime in South Africa , with Johannesburg still listed as one of the five most dangerous cities in the word , along with Mogadishu and New Orleans .
Perceptions of crime defy official statistics , which actually show that the crime rate is falling in the country .
Last September , the South African police said the murder rate had dropped by 28 % since 2003 , with attempted murder down 55 % and assault down 32 % .
Also worth a read is this piece from out chief sports correspondent , Owen Gibson , who looks at "" the complex side to one of the most famous athletes on Earth "" .

Reeva Steenkamp , a law graduate from Port Elizabeth who was a regular cover girl for FHM and the face of Avon in the country , had been extensively pictured on the arm of "" Blade Runner "" Oscar Pistorius in recent months .
But the romance between the double amputee who grew up to be one of South Africa 's biggest global sporting exports and the 30-year - old model took a tragic turn in the early hours of Valentine 's Day .
It ended with Steenkamp lying dead from four gunshot wounds to her head , chest and arm and Pistorius charged with her murder ...
Here 's a bit of background from our Africa correspondent , David Smith , who 's now in court waiting for proceedings to begin .
Steenkamp was shot at around 3 am in Pistorius 's house in an exclusive gated community .
Police said paramedics were already at the scene by the time they arrived and Steenkamp was pronounced dead .
A 9 mm pistol was recovered and there was soon yellow police tape around the grey modern two - storey house , along with crosses marking each door .
Officers said the couple were the only people in the house at the time and there were no signs of forced entry .
They added that neighbours heard "" screaming and shouting "" around the time of the shooting , and that police had been called to investigate incidents of a "" domestic nature "" at the house in the past .
Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius arrived at a court in South Africa at just before 7 am GMT , charged with murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp at his home in Pretoria .
Pistorius earlier left a police station with a coat over his head and arrived at the court amid a media frenzy , TV footage showed .
His hearing before magistrates will take place at 9 am , it was reported .
Pistorius , 26 , was arrested on Thursday over the killing of Steenkamp , 30 , who had been shot in the head and upper body ."

2013-02-16,"The family of sporting idol Oscar Pistorius have broken their silence about the fatal shooting of his girlfriend and vehemently protested his innocence .
Pistorius , dubbed the "" blade runner "" , is in police detention facing a charge of premeditated murder after model Reeva Steenkamp was shot dead at his home in Pretoria last week .
The Paralympian 's uncle , Arnold Pistorius , said that forensic evidence from the crime scene shows that he did not knowingly kill Steenkamp . ""
After consulting with legal representatives , we deeply regret the allegation of premeditated murder , "" he said , reading an emotional statement at his home in Pretoria on Saturday .
"" We have no doubt there is no substance to the allegation and that the state 's own case , including its own forensic evidence , strongly refutes any possibility of a premeditated murder or indeed any murder at all . ""
Media reports in South Africa continue to claim that Pistorius , 26 , told police the shooting was a "" horrible accident "" after he mistakenly believed 29-year - old Steenkamp to be an intruder .
One newspaper suggested that he fired four shots through a bathroom door .
Arnold Pistorius offered an insight into the agonies of the family , many of whom watched helplessly as the athlete broke down in court on Friday .
"" As you can imagine our entire family is devastated , we are in a state of total shock – firstly about the tragic death of Reeva , whom we had all got to know well and care for deeply over the last few months , "" he said .
"" All of us saw at first hand how close she had become to Oscar during that time and how happy they were .
They had plans together and Oscar was happier in his private life than he had been for a long time .
We are all grieving for Reeva , her family and her friends .
He continued : "" Oscar , as you can imagine , is also numb with shock as well as grief .
Obviously at the same time we , as a family , are also battling to come to terms with Oscar being charged with murder . ""
"" Words can not adequately describe our feelings .
The lives of our entire family have been turned upside down for ever by this unimaginable human tragedy and Reeva 's family have suffered a terrible loss .
As a family we are trying to be strong and supportive to Oscar as any close family would be in these dreadful circumstances . ""
Meanwhile , South Africa 's national public broadcaster was described as "" exploitative "" and "" completely sick "" for screening a reality TV show starring Steenkamp .
The SABC , the country 's equivalent of the BBC , went ahead on Saturday with a scheduled broadcast of Tropika Island of Treasure , which had been pre - recorded in Jamaica .
It was preceded with a short series of clips showing Steenkamp enjoying water sports , having fun with fellow contestants and being interviewed .
"" You literally fall in love with Jamaica , "" she said .
"" You fall in love with being in love with love , it 's just one love everywhere . ""
In one segment , presumably recorded when she was voted off the series , Steenkamp said : "" I 'm going home with a sweet taste in my mouth .
I do n't have any regrets , I do n't have any bitterness .
I take home with me so many amazing memories of things
… that I 'll treasure forever .
"" I think that the way you go out , not just your journey in life , but the way that you go out and you make your exit is so important .
You 've either made an impact in a positive way or a negative way , but just maintain integrity and maintain class and just always be true to yourself . ""
Before blowing kisses to the camera , she added : "" And I 'm going to miss you all so much .
I love you very , very much . ""
The screen showed the words , "" In loving memory , Reeva Rebecca Steenkamp , 19 - 08 - 1983 – 14 - 02 - 2013 "" , against a backdrop of her riding a swing .
The actual programme began by introducing the 14 contestants .
Steenkamp was seen posing seductively then lying on a beach in a blue bikini .
She said : "" My name is Reeva and I 'm a model and we 're in Jamaica this year .
"" Smiling and laughing , she continued : "" Be jealous , you can be jealous , yes , you can win a million rand , that 's always good .
I 'm not going anywhere . ""
Some found her posthumous reality TV debut a ghoulish exercise .
Nomboniso Gasa , a researcher and political analyst at PNG Services , said : "" It 's commodification .
What better way to launch it from a completely mercenary point of view ?
I think it 's in poor taste
and it 's highly exploitative .
We 're seeing this pretty girl and thinking how tragic .
In some ways it devalues her death .
What would the SABC have lost if it waited for a period ?
"" The SABC was also attacked by Rachel Jewkes , the director of the gender and health research unit at the South African Medical Research Council . ""
It sounds incredibly tasteless , "" she said .
"" I struggle to think what it would be like for her family to see her swanning around and being normal on TV . ""
Jewkes defended the media 's use of pictures of Steenkamp posing as a model , given that was her own choice of career . ""
But I do think there is a difference because rehashing old photos of her and showing a reality TV show which seems completely sick and cashing in . ""
Presumably they 're expecting to get high ratings and I find that incredibly distateful .
The final decision should have been taken by her relatives but they should n't have to make that decision two days after she died . ""
Steenkamp 's cousin , Sharon Steenkamp , said the family had not been consulted by anyone from the show or the SABC , but they were not against it being aired because the model "" was proud of being in the show . ""
"" Her last words to us personally was that she wants us to watch it , "" Sharon told the Associated Press .
Speaking before the broadcast , Samantha Sutton , a close family friend , said : "" I think Reeva 's mother is going to be in mixed minds : probably delighted to see her daughter but also broken hearted . ""
Shashi Naidoo , owner of a modelling agency and a friend of Steenkamp , added : "" Reeva was very excited about the show
and I think she would have wanted it to air .
As her friends I think we are happy that other people will get to know the warm , bubbly , fun loving person we knew and loved . ""
Samantha Moon , the executive producer of Tropika Island of Treasure , said the family wanted the show to go ahead .
"" They want it on , "" Moon , who works for production company Stimulii , told AP .
"" This is how they want to remember her .
This is what she would have wanted . """
2013-02-16,"The scene was set for pomp and pageantry , though , to be fair , it was not everyone 's idea of riveting television .
The opening of parliament in Cape Town , which always falls close to the anniversary of Nelson Mandela 's release , is South Africa 's day to stand on ceremony and hear the president 's state of the nation address .
Whatever president Jacob Zuma promised this year , few are likely to remember .
The event had been utterly eclipsed by a drama unfolding almost 1,000 miles away in Pretoria .
On Thursday morning South Africans learned that Oscar Pistorius , one of their greatest sporting exports , had allegedly shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp , a model and reality TV contestant .
In a country where front pages are usually dominated by strikes , corruption and power struggles , and debates about inequality and race , this was something different – and something photogenic .
The glamorous celebrity couple were dubbed "" South Africa 's answer to Posh and Becks "" , albeit somewhat prematurely after only a few months of dating .
Suddenly , veteran correspondents of Africa 's wars found themselves trying to "" doorstep "" neighbours , chase police cars and track down former girlfriends .
Pistorius – known as the Blade Runner because of his hi - tech artificial legs – denies murder , but in America the case is already being compared to that of OJ Simpson , setting the stage for one of the most sensational trials in South African history .
This sudden , unexpected tragedy has been traumatising to an already fragile national psyche .
It has provoked debate about the country 's deep - rooted culture of violence , especially against women , and raised questions over whether Pistorius , white and wealthy , will be treated more favourably than the 160,000 inmates who endure incarceration in Africa 's most overcrowded prison system .
Craig Freimond , a film director and writer , was about to give a reading to school pupils last Thursday when he heard the news : "" A woman came in and said Oscar Pistorius has been arrested for shooting his girlfriend .
I was just , like , '
No , no , that 's impossible ' .
One of our greatest heroes shoots his girlfriend ?
It 's seismic .
I find it very upsetting .
It 's definitely triggering some kind of deep emotional response in South Africans . ""
Like many compatriots , Freimond had accepted the Olympian and Paralympian 's status as a role model without question .
"" We have very few of them in this country .
Maybe because of our dividedness , we do n't have that many heroes who cut across all groups .
This guy cut across everything .
He was the superhuman soul . ""
Initial reports suggested that the killing was a "" horrible accident "" in which Pistorius mistook his girlfriend for an intruder – a believable enough scenario in a nation which , according to police figures , saw 16,766 robberies at residential premises last year .
On radio and in social media , South Africans expressed support and pity for the 26-year - old athlete .
But as Thursday wore on , police dismissed the theory , insisting it had not come from them , and said that four shots had been fired after neighbours heard shouting .
Public sympathy for the runner began to wane , especially when the media began to piece together Pistorius 's "" dark side "" : an investigation into reckless driving following a boat crash , a night in police custody after an alleged assault ( a charge later dropped ) , a reported threat to break a man 's legs in a dispute over a woman .
Then there was his interest , perhaps obsession , with guns .
An interview in the New York Times magazine found Pistorius talking about how he drew a pistol to search his home when his alarm went off .
By Friday there was a sense of disillusionment for many as Pistorius appeared in court to face a charge of premeditated murder . ""
The dude was at the height of his powers , "" said Freimond .
"" It 's inconceivable that a hero to so many millions of people would do such a thing . ""
The tragedy has led to calls for a debate about gun control and gun culture like that which is convulsing another country with a tortured racial history : America .
Last weekend Trent Barcroft , chief executive of Chrysler South Africa , was in intensive care after being shot during a robbery outside Johannesburg .
In 2010 , Swedish bride Anni Dewani was shot dead while on honeymoon in Cape Town ; her British husband , Shrien , is still fighting extradition .
The great majority of cases never make headlines .
Up to six million South African civilians own guns – around 12 % of the population – according to estimates .
Airports and casinos have prominent signs directing people to storage rooms to deposit their weapons .
Many keep them for self - defence , citing the country 's spectacular crime rate , but triggering an inevitable arms race with criminals .
Gated communities such as the one where Pistorius lives , with high walls and electrified fences , provide security but arguably inflame the divide between the haves and the have - nots .
"" There 's no question that there 's a gun culture , "" said David Bruce , a criminal justice researcher .
In the late 1990s and early 2000s there was an effective campaign , he added , meaning that South Africa now has strong laws on gun ownership .
The Firearms Control Act of 2004 limits individuals to one gun for self - defence , and guns have since been overtaken by "" sharp instruments "" as the principal cause of murders .
Many are still illegally owned , however . ""
The South African trope about ' you 've got the laws and policies , what about implementing them ? ' would appear to apply in this case , "" said Bruce .
The national murder rate has been declining for years , though an average of 43 lives are still taken every day .
Steenkamp 's death came on the same day as public events decrying gender violence and just weeks after the gang rape and murder of a teenager prompted comparisons with a similar incident in India .
On Friday one TV news presenter asked bluntly : "" Why are South African men so violent ? ""
Belying stereotypes , both Pistorius and his girlfriend were white and well - off .
Eusebius McKaiser , an associate at the Wits Centre for Ethics in Johannesburg , said : "" It shatters the idea that perpetrators and victims look a certain way .
It shatters the belief that domestic violence is solely a product of poverty . ""
From the treatment of pets to voting in TV talent shows , race still worms its way into almost every South African issue .
The immediate aftermath of the shooting brought online comments from white people blaming the failure of the black government to tackle crime for making the likes of Pistorius feel they need guns to defend themselves .
One news site had to suspend its comments section as racist opinions poured in .
Pistorius has , perhaps glibly , been described as a hero to all South Africans when in fact sport often divides along racial lines .
White people make up only 9 % of the population , and his appeal in black townships and villages has rarely been tested .
On the day after the killing , the editorial of the Sowetan newspaper was devoted to the fall of a sporting "" legend "" – not Pistorius but Phil Setshedi , a football coach jailed for match fixing .
McKaiser added : "" For many black South Africans , any embarrassment they have about this story going global is mitigated by the fact that ' he 's not one of us ' .
This is the way race plays out in South Africa . ""
In court on Friday , as Pistorius repeatedly broke down and sobbed , chief magistrate Desmond Nair said he was anxious to avoid any perception that the Olympian would receive "" preferential treatment "" .
Yet the magistrate acceded to a request for Pistorius to spend the weekend at a police station rather than the grimmer surroundings of prison , as would be the normal convention .
One advocate taking part in the case admitted the decision was based on Pistorius 's fame rather than special needs due to his disability .
"" There are plenty of disabled people in jail , "" he said drily .
The fallen champion is due back in court on Tuesday to apply for bail , which police have said they will oppose .
Given the vagaries of South Africa 's delay - prone courts , it could be many months before he stands trial .
The magistrate has already ruled that TV cameras will not be allowed .
The first exchanges at Friday 's court hearing pitted advocate Gerrie Nel – best known for the successful prosecution of a national police commissioner for corruption – against advocate Barry Roux for the defence .
The rapid arrival of Stuart Higgins , former editor of the Sun , to strengthen Pistorius 's PR operation suggested that the media circus is coming to town .
But whatever the wider implications , for many this remains a compelling story about one extraordinary man and his unfathomable fall from grace .
Six months ago Oscar Pistorius was on the track , performing to cheering crowds , one of the jewels in London 's Olympic and Paralympic crown ; today he is languishing behind bars , contemplating a possible life sentence .
South Africa might do well to heed Bertolt Brecht 's old line : "" Unhappy the land that is in need of heroes . """
2013-02-17,
2013-02-17,"Oscar Pistorius was the perfect South African sporting hero because victory over his disability made him a universally admired figure in a still - divided society .
The profoundly macho culture he grew up in spans racial groups and provides some explanation for the country 's shocking rates of domestic violence . ""
Black South African men are expected to prove their manliness by carrying knives and having lots of girlfriends , '' said Rachel Jewkes of the South African Medical Research Council .
"" White Afrikaners like Pistorius do not need to have several girlfriends .
But his love of guns speaks to the same hunger to prove his masculinity in the South African context .
"" The full facts about the death of model Reeva Steenkamp have yet to emerge , but to South Africans her death came on the eve of the Black Friday Campaign for Rape Awareness in honour of Anene Booysen .
The 17-year - old died after her ex - boyfriend and others allegedly gang raped and disembowelled her on 2 February . ""
The massive problem we need to understand in South Africa is the level of men 's violence against women and against each other , '' said Lisa Vetten , a researcher who specialises in domestic abuse .
Police statistics on domestic violence are limited .
But 15,609 murders and 64,500 reported rapes in 2011 - 12 suggest massive levels of violence in South African homes .
Household surveys by the MRC have found that 40 % of men have hit their partner and one in four men have raped a woman .
Three - quarters of men who admit to having raped women say they did so first as teenagers .
The MRC found that , while a quarter of women had been raped , just 2 % of those raped by a partner reported the incident to police .
Experts say South African society features all the known causes of rape and violence , including a historical culture of "" might is right "" , a wealth gap that makes men feel weak , an unequal relationship between women and men , lack of adequate childcare , which results in the neglect of boys , and high male unemployment .
Jewkes , a British doctor and director of gender and health at the MRC , said : "" Having a father at home is really unusual here .
South African children are more likely to be raised by a non - biological parent than by both biological parents .
So you see high levels of neglect , humiliation and abuse , which develops into domestic violence .
We also have a high rate of teenage pregnancies and those young mothers are not equipped to raise their children .
"" South African men think women should be under their control .
There is an idea that violence is justifiable as a means to keep women in their place .
This has not changed in 20 years and even though the South African murder rate has dropped by 50 % since 1999 , rape figures have not , "" said Jewkes .
Jewkes and Vetten argue that Pistorius 's love of guns and fast cars illustrates his relationship with South Africa 's macho culture . ""
Afrikaner men are very patriarchal , "" said Jewkes , "" and within that culture gun ownership is seen as part of masculinity . ""
Vetten believes that the pressure on Pistorius may have been compounded .
"" Disabled men and women often struggle with their sense of masculinity or femininity because they are to some degree dependent .
I have seen examples of them placing particular pride on physical attractiveness .
Maybe he struggles with that .
The guns and sports cars gave an impression that he was over - compensating so as to be seen as ' normal ' . ""
But the tragedy in South Africa is that the most "" normal "" thing of all is violence against women .
Under the polygamous President Jacob Zuma , known for his traditionalist and sexist remarks , there is also a sense of men getting away with it .
Minister of human settlements Tokyo Sexwale is currently fighting a divorce case by his wife Judy which cites emotional mental and verbal abuse .
But his political career has been unaffected .
The media raise the issue with regularity .
Column inches were occupied last month with wonderment at the outpouring of grief in India over the rape of a New Delhi student on a bus .
Commentators asked why such a reaction in South Africa , where gang rapes are a daily occurrence , is unthinkable .
Black Friday , during which radio chat show hosts called on listeners to wear black , was a media attempt to create a reaction .
But South Africa appeared largely unmoved .
While the country has a Domestic Violence Act that enables police to intervene if a woman fears attack , it is poorly implemented .
Jennifer Williams , director of the Women 's Legal Centre , said : "" There is a problem of resources and police training .
Too often the women who come to us have been told by the police , ' He seems like a nice guy , surely you can sort it out ' .
Other women are turned away from courts because there is a shortage of magistrates .
We have a national emergency , yet rape crisis centres are closing . """

2013-02-18,"The mystery over South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius 's role in the killing of the model Reeva Steenkamp has deepened amid a series of claims and counter - claims about what happened at his home in Pretoria last week .
South African newspapers reported a series of dramatic revelations about the case , in which Steenkamp was shot four times .
Police denied leaking the details and Pistorius 's agent refused to comment .
A police spokeswoman could not explain how the claims emerged but did not deny them .
"" We are not commenting on anything in the newspapers today as the case is still before the court , "" she said .
"" They are insinuating they got the information from the police .
They did not . ""
Medupe Simasiku , of the national prosecuting authority , said the alleged leaks did not necessarily affect the court case as "" the evidence [ published ] might be wrong "" .
The well - respected City Press newspaper reported that a cricket bat covered in blood was found at Pistorius 's home and is the central piece of evidence against him .
Citing sources close to the investigation , the paper said Steenkamp 's skull was crushed and police requested Pistorius undergo drug tests .
City Press also reported that Pistorius called his father soon after 3.20am on Thursday and asked him to come to the house .
When the family arrived , Pistorius was allegedly carrying Steenkamp down the stairs , her head and arms "" dangling "" .
"" Steenkamp was still breathing and Pistorius tried to resuscitate her in the foyer , "" the report continued .
"" Paramedics and police arrived on the scene and , minutes later , she was declared dead . ""
Steenkamp was wearing her nightie at the time .
When the police inspected Oscar 's bedroom , they found her overnight bag and iPad on the floor .
A holster for a 9 mm pistol was found on Oscar 's side of the bed .
"" All sources dismissed the theory that Pistorius mistook Steenkamp for a burglar , the paper added .
"" The sources agreed that the state had a ' rock - solid ' case against the popular athlete . ""
Peet van Zyl , Pistorius 's agent , said he had "" not read a lot of the media "" on Sunday so could not comment .
He added that the runner had received "" overwhelming support "" from fans all over the world .
Later , van Zyl confirmed he had cancelled all of the athlete 's commitments , including a race in the UK , so he could "" concentrate on the legal proceedings "" .
The eNews Channel Africa presented a narrative in which CCTV footage showed Steenkamp arriving at the house at 6 pm on Wednesday .
It said neighbours claimed they heard arguments , and investigators believed the couple were together in bed at one point .
It was thought Steenkamp moved to the bathroom and was shot through the closed door , possibly at close range , the channel reported .
Pistorius picked her up and carried her downstairs .
He called a family member but not the police , who were alerted instead by neighbours .
Pistorius , 26 , who last year became the first double amputee to compete against able - bodied athletes in the Olympics , remains in police custody , facing a charge of murder .
On Sunday he was visited by a pastor , AJ Wilson , who told Reuters television : "" The ( police ) colonel told him that I have come to pray with him .
He just cried and we all cried together .
"" Pistorius is due to apply for bail at a court hearing in Pretoria on Tuesday , the same day that Steenkamp , 29 , is due to be cremated at a private funeral .
Her father , Barry Steenkamp , told the Mail on Sunday that the family was struggling to come to terms with the death , but added : "" There is no hatred in our hearts . ""
He said of Pistorius : "" He must be going through things that we do n't know about .
We ask the Lord every day to help us find a reason why this should happen to Reeva .
She was the most beautiful , kind girl in the world . ""
Pistorius 's father , Henke , said he had "" zero doubt "" that Steenkamp 's death was a tragic accident .
He told the Sunday Telegraph : "" When you are a sportsman , you act even more on instinct .
It 's instinct – things happen and that 's what you do . ""
He added : "" When you wake up in the middle of the night – and crime is so endemic in South Africa – what do you do if somebody is in the house ?
Do you think it 's one of your family ?
Of course you do n't .
""
A close friend of Pistorius told how the athlete phoned him moments after Steenkamp was shot . ""
Oscar called me at 3.55am saying that Reeva had been shot , "" Justin Divaris told the Sunday People .
"" I said to him : ' What are you talking about ?
I do n't understand you . '
He then repeated himself : ' There has been a terrible accident , I shot Reeva . ' ""
Next thing his neighbour picked up the phone and told me it was true and told me to get to Oscar 's home .
I was in total shock .
I asked the neighbour : ' Is she OK ? '
Did the gun go off by accident ? '
She replied : ' No .
She 's not OK .
You need to get here . ' """

2013-02-18,"The family of Oscar Pistorius have criticised the media for sensationalist coverage of the murder case against him .
Henke Pistorius , 59 , the South African Olympic and Paralympic star 's father , said he was "" very disappointed "" by weekend press reports that a blood - stained cricket bat was a vital piece of evidence in the killing of the athlete 's girlfriend , model Reeva Steenkamp .
"" I 'm disappointed in the integrity of some of the newspapers , "" Henke told the Guardian .
Pistorius , known as the Blade Runner because of his hi - tech artificial legs , is due back in court for a bail hearing on Tuesday morning .
"" I 'll be sitting behind Oscar , "" said Henke .
"" We will split the rubbish from the fact .
This is a very bad matter .
It is an accident .
Out of respect for Oscar , I do n't want to say anything else . ""
Asked if he found the media reports sensationalist , he replied : "" Of course .
That 's their job .
They want to sell newspapers . ""
British newspapers have not escaped criticism for their coverage of the case , with the Sun 's front page – featuring a big picture of Steenkamp in a bikini – prompting hundreds of complaints , including from the former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott .
Pistorius repeatedly broke down in tears in a Pretoria court last Friday .
His father and brother , Carl , were sitting behind him and leaned forward at different times to put comforting hands on his back .
His sister Aimee was also present .
Pistorius , 26 , has been held in a police cell since 29-year - old Steenkamp was found shot dead at the athlete 's home last Thursday .
Police reportedly check on him hourly .
At Tuesday 's hearing , Pistorius 's defence team is expected to present its case first , arguing that their client is not a danger to the public and does not pose a flight risk .
It will also be the first opportunity for the prosecution to describe evidence police gathered against the double - amputee runner and why they are pushing for a charge of premeditated murder .
Police have said they will oppose his bail application .
Hundreds of miles away in Port Elizabeth , Steenkamp 's family are preparing for her funeral , also on Tuesday .
A private ceremony at a local crematorium is planned , closed to the public and media .
"" We 're just taking things one day at a time , "" Steenkamp 's brother Adam was quoted as saying by the Associated Press ( AP ) . ""
But at the moment it 's family coming together and the one person who would be the strongest , who held us all together , is unfortunately not here anymore and that 's my sister . ""
Steenkamp 's mother paid tribute to her daughter .
June Steenkamp told the Times of South Africa : "" Why ?
Why my little girl ?
Why did this happen ?
Why did he do this ? ""
Just like that she is gone .
In the blink of an eye and a single breath , the most beautiful person who ever lived is no longer here .
"" All we have is this horrendous death to deal with …
All we want are answers … answers as to why this had to happen , why our beautiful daughter had to die like this . ""
Pistorius 's family deny he committed murder , though they have not addressed whether he shot her .
South African media reports suggest that Pistorius claims he mistook her for an intruder in his home .
In an email to AP on Monday , Pistorius 's longtime coach said he believed the killing was an accident .
"" I pray that we can all , in time , come through this challenging situation following the accident and I am looking forward to the day I can get my boy back on the track , "" Ampie Louw wrote .
"" I am still in shock following the heartbreaking events that occurred last week and my thoughts and prayers are with both of the families involved . ""
Louw said Steenkamp had often accompanied Pistorius to training .
"" I found her to be delightful , very friendly ... and I found the two of them to be very happy in each other 's company . """
2013-02-19,"For a short while , Oscar Pistorius had maintained his composure in the dock , his face a wan and weary mask .
Then came his account of what happened the night Reeva Steenkamp died , read by his defence lawyer , and the mask cracked .
Pistorius 's whole body shook and he wept uncontrollably , as if a chasm of grief threatened to swallow him .
The magistrate halted proceedings for a few minutes , explaining : "" My compassion as a human being does not allow me to just sit here . ""
This was the tense , taut - as - a - drum atmosphere at the bail hearing in court C in Pretoria magistrates court on Tuesday , as prosecutors built a case of premeditated murder against Pistorius and one of the world 's most famous athletes gave his version of events for the first time .
The prosecution asserted that Pistorius had "" shot an unarmed and innocent woman "" after getting out of bed , putting on his prosthetic legs and walking seven metres to fire through the locked door of the toilet .
Pistorius , 26 , admitted shooting his girlfriend but claimed that he had panicked in the dark and mistaken her for a burglar .
The magistrate , Desmond Nair , ruled that the charge against Pistorius would be categorised as the most serious possible under South African law , dealing a blow to his hopes of securing bail .
Pistorius visibly trembled at the decision while his tearful family gathered in a small circle , arms around each other , as cameras clicked and filmed from every angle .
As a day of drama and riveting testimony in the sweltering courtroom unfolded , Steenkamp , a model seen on numerous magazine covers , was cremated hundreds of miles away at an emotional funeral service in Port Elizabeth .
The mood among more than 100 family members and friends was described as a combination of sadness and anger .
Pistorius , wearing a dark suit – at one point his brother leaned forward to turn down the collar – blue shirt and dark patterned tie , with a white tissue between his fingers , cut a mournful figure in the dock .
His eyes were dark and hooded as if sore from crying , his shoulders sagged from time to time and his head bowed repeatedly .
He spoke only to say "" yes , sir "" , or "" yes , your worship "" softly to the magistrate a few times .
Pressing for a charge of premeditated murder , the prosecutor , Gerrie Nel , said Steenkamp had been shot three times in a small 1.4 m x 1.14 m room where she was cowering after a shouting match .
He dismissed Pistorius 's claim that he thought she was a burglar as "" all part of the pre - planning "" .
He asked : "" Why would a burglar lock himself inside the bathroom ? ""
Even if the burglar theory had been true , he added , it "" still constitutes premeditated murder "" because Pistorius knowingly opened fire on what he believed to be a defenceless burglar .
It was left to the defence advocate , Barry Roux , to read Pistorius 's sworn affidavit to the court , in which barely any floor space was visible beneath a chaotic scrum of officials , family members and reporters , photographers and TV crews with equipment .
A hush descended as the statement of Oscar Leonard Carl Pistorius began .
"" I fail to understand how I could be charged with murder , let alone premeditated murder , as I had no intention to kill my girlfriend , "" Pistorius insisted .
The Olympian and Paralympian claimed that , on 13 February , Steenkamp called him and suggested they spend the evening at his home , where they had a quiet dinner .
By 10 pm , the court heard , they were in the bedroom , she doing yoga and he in bed watching television , his prosthetic legs off .
She then got into bed and they both fell asleep .
"" We were deeply in love and could not be happier .
I know she felt the same way .
She had given me a present for Valentine 's Day but asked me only to open it the next day . ""
Pistorius said he was "" acutely aware "" of violent crimes committed by intruders .
He had received death threats in the past and had been a victim of violence and burglary .
For that reason , he kept a 9 mm Parabellum pistol under his bed at night .
The athlete woke up in the early hours of 14 February , he added , and went on to the balcony to bring a fan in and close the sliding doors , blinds and curtains .
"" I heard a noise and realised that someone was in the bathroom .
I felt a sense of terror rushing over me .
There are no burglar bars across the bathroom window and I knew that contractors who worked at my house had left the ladders outside .
Although I did not have my prosthetic legs on I have mobility on my stumps .
"" I believed that someone had entered my house .
I was too scared to switch a light on .
I grabbed my 9 mm pistol from underneath my bed .
On my way to the bathroom I screamed words to the effect for him / them to get out of my house and for Reeva to phone the police .
It was pitch dark in the bedroom
and I thought Reeva was in bed . ""
He went on : "" I noticed that the bathroom window was open .
I realised that the intruder / s was / were in the toilet because the toilet door was closed and I did not see anyone in the bathroom .
I heard movement inside the toilet .
The toilet is inside the bathroom and has a separate door . ""
It filled me with horror and fear of an intruder or intruders being inside the toilet .
I thought he or they must have entered through the unprotected window .
As I did not have my prosthetic legs on and felt extremely vulnerable , I knew I had to protect Reeva and myself .
"" I believe that when the intruder / s came out of the toilet we would be in grave danger .
I felt trapped as my bedroom door was locked and I have limited mobility on my stumps .
"" I fired shots at the toilet door and shouted to Reeva to phone the police .
She did not respond and I moved backwards out of the bathroom , keeping my eyes on the bathroom entrance .
Everything was pitch dark in the bedroom
and I was still too scared to switch on a light .
Reeva was not responding .
"" When I reached the bed , I realised Reeva was not in the bed .
That is when it dawned on me that it could have been Reeva who was in the toilet .
I returned to the bathroom calling her name .
I tried to open the toilet door but it was locked .
I rushed back into the bedroom and opened the sliding door exiting on to the balcony and screamed for help .
"" Pistorius put on his prosthetic legs , ran back to the bathroom and tried to kick the toilet door open , he said .
He went back to the bedroom to grab his cricket bat and smash open the toilet door .
One or more panels broke off and he found the key so he was able to open it . ""
Reeva was slumped over but alive .
I battled to get her out of the toilet and pulled her into the bathroom . ""
Pistorius said he called an administrator of his estate and asked him to phone an ambulance and also called a private hospital .
He carried Steenkamp , 29 , downstairs so she could be taken to hospital . ""
Downstairs , I tried to render the assistance to Reeva that I could , but she died in my arms . ""
Pistorius reflected : "" I am absolutely mortified by the events and the devastating loss of my beloved Reeva .
With the benefit of hindsight I believe that Reeva went to the toilet when I went out on the balcony to bring the fan in .
I can not bear to think of the suffering I have caused her and her family , knowing how much she was loved .
"" I also know that the events of that tragic night were as I have described them and that in due course I have no doubt the police and expert investigators will bear this out . ""
The court also heard affidavits from friends of the couple .
They spoke of how Pistorius and Steenkamp seemed very happy together , even if he was moving a little too fast for her in the relationship .
One said : "" Oscar told me Reeva could be the girl he would one day marry . ""
Another , named Samantha , recalled : "" Reeva told me that she really liked Oscar and they both clicked and understood each other . ""
Pistorius treated her "" like gold "" , Samantha added .
"" Reeva said if Oscar asked her to marry him , she would probably say yes . ""
At that , Pistorius bowed his head and wept .
Earlier , the prosecutor told the court that Steenkamp had arrived at the house in a gated community at about 6 pm on 13 February with an overnight bag .
He said Pistorius fired four times into the door of the toilet where Steenkamp had taken refuge after an argument .
Three of the bullets hit her , Nel said .
"" She could n't go anywhere , "" Nel argued .
"" You can run nowhere ...
It must have been horrific . ""
"" The applicant armed himself , attached his prosthesis , walked seven metres to the bathroom and shot the deceased while she was in the toilet , "" he continued .
It was not , he argued , a case of "" there was someone standing over my bed "" , something which might cause a spontaneous reaction . ""
He shot four times ...
There 's no possible explanation to support his report that he thought it was a burglar ...
If I arm myself , walk a distance and murder a person , that is premeditated .
The door is closed .
There is no doubt .
I walk seven metres and I kill . ""
The "" cold facts "" added up to premeditated murder , he added .
Nel said the prosecution was giving details only relevant to the bail hearing and would present its full case later . ""
The broken door is important .
She was there , she locked the door for a purpose , I 'm not allowed to give you that purpose now . ""
Pistorius sobbed as his lawyer insisted the shooting was an accident and that there was no evidence to substantiate a murder charge . ""
Was it to kill her , or was it to get her out ?
"" he asked about the broken - down door . ""
We submit it is not even murder .
There is no concession this is a murder . ""
He said the state had provided no evidence that the couple quarrelled or offered a motive .
Nel rebutted : "" The motive is ' I want to kill ' . ""
Pistorius won two gold medals and one silver at the London Paralympics last year .
The court heard that Pistorius 's house is valued at 5 m rand ( £ 360,000 ) and he owns two further properties worth a total of 1.6 m rand .
His occupation as an athlete provides him with about 5.6 m rand a year , and he has cash investments in excess of 1 m rand a year .
The bail hearing continues ."
2013-02-19,"The BBC has apologised after it followed a news report on the trial of Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius with Jimi Hendrix 's Hey Joe which features a lyric about a man shooting his girlfriend .
Pistorius appeared in a South African court on Tuesday for his second appearance over the death of his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp and was formally charged with premeditated murder .
The bulletin on the BBC 6 Music breakfast show , which included details of the case , was played at 9 am and was followed by the Jimi Hendrix Experience version of Hey Joe .
The much - covered track , originally recorded by LA folk - rockers The Leaves , includes the lines "" Hey Joe , where you going with that gun in your hand ?
I 'm going out to shoot my old lady ,
you know I caught her messing around with another man "" .
The show 's presenter Nemone , who was sitting in for the usual host Shaun Keaveny , apologised on air after the track was played .
A BBC spokeswoman said : "" In light of the nature of the news story , we apologise for any offence caused by the proximity of the song
Hey Joe to the bulletin .
An on - air apology was made immediately the mistake was realised . """

2013-02-19,"The president of the International Paralympic Committee has insisted the momentum generated by the London Games will not be halted by the arrest of Oscar Pistorius – its most high profile athlete – on a murder charge .
Sir Philip Craven , the Bolton - born president of the IPC , has spoken of his "" shock "" at the death of Reeva Steenkamp and the arrest of Pistorius on charges of premeditated murder .
But on Tuesday he wrote to all members of the IPC to try to "" impress how we 're moving forward "" and to "" make the differentiation between what happened there are what we 're about as a movement "" .
Craven insisted that the "" euphoria "" created by the London Paralympics and the extent to which it created new stars to rival Pistorius would ensure that it was not derailed by the events in South Africa .
He said that since the London Games , the Paralympics were now associated with a wider range of athletes by the public .
"" It has changed since the summer and we 've many new stars coming through .
I 've been amazed over the last six months how fresh and bright those memories from London still are in people 's minds , "" he told the Guardian .
"" This is a major tragedy but we have to differentiate it away from Paralympic sport and the Paralympic movement and what will happen in Sochi [ 2014 ] and in Rio [ 2016 ] . ""
Craven insisted that he had never been concerned that the Paralympics were so closely linked in the public mind with a single athlete , even before the London Games .
"" It never really worried me .
I was very quick to point out before the Games that there were 4,200 athletes in London , all with great stories to tell , "" he said .
"" When you have people like Alan Oliveira , Jonnie Peacock , who are 21 and 19 – they are the future of the movement .
There are so many names on people 's lips that we are still in a very strong position . ""
Since the London Paralympics , the IPC has signed a new broadcasting deal with Channel 4 to screen the Rio 2016 Games and develop a range of support programming over the next four years .
It has also announced plans for a new series of athletics meetings as it attempts to build a more coherent events programme in between Games .
Craven insisted that meetings with US broadcasters and commercial partners now waking up to the potential of the Paralympics would not be derailed by the Pistorius case .
"" It 's quite natural to have these emotions , to want to know more and to want to know what really did happen .
But we also have to make the differentiation between what happened there and what we 're about as a movement , "" he said .
While he would not comment on the police investigation , Craven spoke of his "" shock "" and "" disbelief "" at hearing the news of Steenkamp 's death and Pitorius 's arrest .
"" My immediate thoughts were to convey my sincere condolences to Reeva Steenkamp and her family .
I remained in that strange quasi - world for Thursday and Friday , and by Saturday morning was thinking more clearly about the whole thing , "" he said ."
2013-02-19,"After an initial brief gasp of collective stunned silence , South Africans have talked of little else than the death of Oscar Pistorius 's girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp .
We simply ca n't get enough of the story and our voracious appetite for more , and yet more , gory detail seems only to feed on itself .
Pistorius has not even formally pleaded to a murder charge in court yet .
And even before his formal bail application this morning , we had already read over the weekend that a bloodied cricket bat would be a key piece of evidence in the trial , that Steenkamp was wearing her nightdress when she died and that her skull had been crushed .
The press has also been replete with stories of Pistorius 's "" temper "" and womanising ways .
The British public and press may well be baffled by the amount of detail the South African press has published about the state 's case against Pistorius .
In the UK , leaked details of a criminal investigation would be likely to put a publication at risk of being held in contempt of court .
After a brief stint reporting courts in the UK , I was similarly baffled by how little British court reporters are able to cover , limited by what seemed to me to be draconian "" reporting restrictions "" – to the point where the press sometimes was able to cover little more than a description of the accused 's "" blue suit and red tie "" .
It seems all the more strange because the law in the two countries is not actually all that different .
What is famously known in South Africa as the "" sub judice rule "" , which allows for contempt of court prosecutions if media reports could prejudice a trial , is still , in theory at least , part of South African law .
The legal test for when a successful prosecution can be brought is , in South Africa , very similar to the test applied in the courts of England and Wales : the question a court must ask is whether there will be "" real risk "" of substantial prejudice to the administration of justice .
The bar was set much lower before the dawn of South Africa 's constitutional order in 1993 .
Then , publications could be ( and regularly were ) successfully prosecuted for contempt of court if a report "" tended "" to prejudice the administration of justice , but a seminal judgment of the supreme court of appeal , South Africa 's highest court on non - constitutional matters , reviewed the test in 2007 .
The question must now be decided in the context of a balancing exercise between two competing constitutional rights : the right to a fair trial and the right to freedom of expression .
This is similar to the way English courts have framed their approach .
The big difference between the English system and South Africa is that South African criminal trials are not decided by jury .
The jury system was done away with altogether in 1969 .
The thinking is that judges are trained to put aside their prejudices and decide cases on the basis of the evidence before them and the law .
Unlike juries , they also have to give reasons for their decisions .
A real risk of substantial prejudice to the administration of justice is therefore much , much lower when there is no jury .
In fact , many media lawyers in South Africa think the sub judice rule should be abandoned altogether because it is an anachronism ; a hangover from the days when the country had juries , which was preserved by the apartheid - era government to strangle the press .
In recent years , the rule has , in practical terms , fallen by the wayside .
An attempt by fraud accused J Arthur Brown in 2011 for a stay of prosecution because of a "" media campaign "" against him failed dismally .
Others think there may still conceivably be a chance that media coverage could present a high enough risk of prejudice to a trial to trigger a successful contempt prosecution , but media law expert Dario Milo at solicitors firm
Webber Wenztel says it would need to a "" pretty egregious breach "" .
The Pistorius coverage , so far , is yet to reach that point , he says .
However , if the media circus around the Pistorius trial continues on its current trajectory , it may very well be the case that truly tests whether the sub judice rule has any teeth , or whether it has simply died a natural death in South Africa 's constitutional democracy .

2013-02-20,"Police Pistorius fired at an angle into the toilet door .
Steenkamp 's wounds suggested she was not on the toilet at the time but "" hiding "" in the right - hand side of the toilet room .
Defence Steenkamp 's bladder was empty when she died , indicating she had indeed got up to use the toilet as usually at 3 am you would not find an empty bladder .
Autopsy showed no sign of defensive wounds or an assault .

Defence
No evidence that Pistorius had attached his prosthetic legs before the shooting .
Under cross - examination the officer leading the inquiry accepted this fact .
Police Pistorius would have had to pass his bed to walk to the bathroom , suggesting he would have noticed whether or not Steenkamp was in bed .
A holster for the gun was found on the same side of the bed as Steenkamp 's overnight bag and slippers .
Defence Pistorius had a shoulder problem so he slept on the other side of the bed than usual .
Steenkamp had spent the previous night there too , and had slept on her usual side that night .

2013-02-20,"In this painting – I mean photograph – Olympic and Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius is given tremendous dignity .
The solitude of his situation is dramatically illuminated as he faces the most serious murder charge that can be brought in South Africa .
It is hard to believe the picture was not set up for hours to get the composition right and the lighting suitably Rembrandtesque .
It really does have the gravitas of an oil painting .
And yet this is a real - life image seized by Siphiwe Sibeko during an emotional , contentious , crowded pretrial hearing .
Does this study in suffering sentimentalise Pistorius ?
It is far more subtle than that .
The truth of what happened at his house in the early hours of Valentine 's Day will not be decided by a court for many months , although defence and prosecution agree that he shot Reeva Steenkamp dead – either deliberately , or in a terrible mistaken attack on an imagined burglar .
Whatever the truth , here we see him isolated by the awful event and unresolved mystery of the night Steenkamp died .
The picture eerily captures his psychological isolation .
The courtroom audience is physically and symbolically separated from him by a low wooden wall that might as well be a 100 ft high barbed wire fence .
It is the barrier between the accused and unaccused .
Some of the people look at him , some do n't , and the eyes of those who study Pistorius seem mystified and uncertain rather than emotionally committed for or against .
Meanwhile , his own eyes are shadowed and enigmatic .
His pain is not just in his face but his entire body language – his sportsman 's frame is taut and electrified , as if he were ready to sprint , but it is the ordeal of the bail hearing that fills him with angst and supercharged emotion .
Clearly , South Africa 's courtrooms are designed by someone with a flair for the dramatic .
What gives this photograph such intensity is the court lighting , which would not be out of place in a Caravaggio painting .
The room is dark , with just enough light to reveal faces against tones of gloom .
The wall behind the public gallery is black , except for a pool of light that reveals a rusty , or bloody , red - brick arc of wall .
This curve of light heightens our concentration on the solitary figure of Pistorius , for he is caught by the camera right next to it .
And so he stands in shadows , picked out by a reddish glow , his eyes dark pools of horror ."

2013-02-20,""" This is like watching a baby seal getting clubbed , "" tweeted South African journalist Karyn Maughan on Wednesday .
The baby seal was police detective Hilton Botha .
The club was defence advocate Barry Roux , the man trying to save Oscar Pistorius from prison .
Roux ran rings around the police officer of 24 years ' experience who crumpled under cross - examination , his bold assertions about Pistorius 's guilt unravelling one by one .
The senior advocate of the Johannesburg bar gave a massive confidence boost to Pistorius and his family .
They had lost day one of the bail hearing , when the magistrate determined that Pistorius must answer the most serious charge possible .
But judging by their expressions and even smiles , they clearly felt they had won day two , thanks in no small part to Roux 's robust approach .
If this is South Africa 's equivalent of the circus that was the O J Simpson trial , then Roux is the heir to flamboyant American defence lawyer Johnnie Cochran .
It is speculated that , as one of the country 's leading advocates in criminal cases , he could be earning around 50,000 rand ( £ 3,600 ) per day .
Roux was admitted to the Johannesburg bar in 1982 and is a senior advocate .
An online profile says his practice "" comprises criminal , insurance , delictual , aviation , matrimonial , medical negligence , general contractual and liquidation work "" .
Observers describe Roux as a legal gun for hire who is not motivated by altruism .
In the 1990s he reportedly acted on behalf of lieutenant - general Lothar Neethling , an apartheid - era police chief , who sued newspapers for damages over claims that he supplied a toxin to be used on anti - apartheid activists .
Roux 's other cases include dentist Casper Greeff , convicted of murdering his wife , and businessman Dave King .
More recently he was involved in the prosecution of mining magnate Roger Kebble , the father of politically connected murder victim Brett Kebble .
But never has he had a place in the limelight like this .
Each day , watched by dozens of reporters and photographers , Roux takes his seat at a desk beneath the magistrate along with attorney Kenny Oldwage and other members of the defence team .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel and his colleagues sit to the magistrate 's right in the somewhat mundane redbrick courtroom .
On Wednesday Yesterday Roux showed his mettle by directing firm , aggressive and piercing questions at the hangdog detective on the stand .
On a couple of occasions , magistrate Desmond Nair had to step in , like a referee in a boxing match , to give the witness time to finish his answer .
But Botha was worn down by the relentless pressure .
Whereas he had begun by supporting the prosecution 's case and arguing that Pistorius should be denied bail , he ultimately had to concede that he had not found anything at the scene inconsistent with the athlete 's version of events .
Roux put it to him several times to ram the point home .
Afterwards , asked how the day had gone , Roux said simply : "" I do n't know , I just work here . ""
"" Was it fun ? ""
someone asked . ""
No case is fun , "" he replied .
"" It 's hard work . ""
As for Botha , he breathed a sigh of relief that his ordeal was over .
"" It 's difficult to concentrate with all the media here , that 's the problem .
"" How do you feel ? ""
Much better now . ""
The police 's failings may have played a part in allowing Roux to shine .
William Booth , a criminal defence lawyer who believes Pistorius should get bail , said : "" He did a good job and deserves credit for getting the detective to concede a lot of ground , but my question is : were the police properly prepared , why go to the witness box and say he 's a flight risk ?
Why is he a flight risk ?
He ca n't answer . """
2013-02-21,"The prosecution of Oscar Pistorius has taken a dramatic turn after it emerged the detective leading the case is facing seven charges of attempted murder .
A spokesperson for the South African police service confirmed on Thursday morning that Hilton Botha and two other officers were accused of firing at a taxi carrying seven passengers during an allegedly drunken incident in 2011 .
The revelation of charges against Botha presents additional difficulties for the prosecution and raises further questions about Botha , who crumbled under cross - examination in court on Wednesday , when his assertions about Pistorius 's guilt unravelled one by one .
There are unconfirmed reports that Botha might be removed from the Pistorius investigation .
When the bail hearing resumed on Thursday the chief prosecutor , Gerrie Nel , began by explaining the attempted murder charges to the court , stating he wanted to put matters on the record . ""
The case [ against Botha ] was originally dropped but now it has been reinstated , "" Nel said .
Botha was not present at the time , and the hearing was briefly adjourned as officials looked for him .
Nel joked "" there goes my case "" as Botha was brought back into the court .
The detective , who was not questioned about the 2009 incident , was asked to clarify some of his statements to the court regarding the evidence in the Pistorius case .
South African news reports said at the time of the alleged shooting in 2011 that Botha and the other officers were pursuing a man accused of murdering and dismembering a woman before dumping her body parts down a drain .
The officers were arrested in 2011 and are due to appear in court in May.
A police spokesman , Neville Malila , told the news website Eye Witness News the charges were initially dropped but later reinstated .
"" There was a decision taken by the DPP 's office to charge the members , each one of them with seven counts of attempted murder .
That was the number of people that were in the taxi , "" Malila said .
The prosecution said they were unaware of the charges against the detective when they put him on the stand to explain why Pistorius , who is charged with murder of his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , should not be given bail .
Malila said police learned on Wednesday that the director of public prosecutions ( DPP ) has reinstated the charges against Botha .
He said police were waiting for details from his case file from the prosecutor .
The National Prosecuting Authority ( NPA ) said the charges against Botha were reinstated on 4 February , 10 days before Pistorius shot dead Steenkamp , 29 , in a locked toilet at his Pretoria home .
"" The decision to reinstate was taken on 4 February , way before the issue of Pistorius came to light or the murder of Reeva was committed , "" an NPA spokesman , Medupe Simasiku , told Reuters .
"" It 's completely unrelated to this trial . ""
The police force said they had chosen Botha , an officer for 24 years and detective for 16 , in spite of the charges because of his experience . ""
[ Botha ] is innocent until proven guilty , "" Malila said .
"" [ He ] was chosen by the station to do the investigation due to the fact that he is a senior . ""
The revelations come after serious failings in the prosecution case against Pistorius were exposed on Wednesday .
Botha struggled during defence cross - examination after he wrongly claimed to have found boxes of testosterone in Pistorius 's bedroom and admitted that police had no evidence contradicting the athlete 's version of events .
The detective has been a central figure in the case against Pistorius , the gold medal - winning Olympic and Paralympic athlete known as the Blade Runner .
Pistorious has admitted shooting dead Steenkamp while she was in the bathroom of his home on 14 February , but denies a charge of premeditated murder , claiming he mistook her for an intruder .
Botha has been strongly criticised by Pistorious 's family , who have been closely following the athlete 's bail hearing from the court in Pretoria .
The detective was forced to correct the testosterone allegation , admitting under cross - examination that he could not be certain of the contents ."
2013-02-21,"The prosecution case against the Olympic and Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius has been dealt serious blows after South African police admitted a series of blunders in their murder investigation – and the chief investigator turned out to be on attempted murder charges himself .
Hilton Botha , the detective leading the investigation , had crumbled under defence cross - examination on Wednesday after he wrongly claimed to have found boxes of "" testosterone "" in Pistorius 's bedroom and admitted that police had no evidence contradicting the athlete 's version of events .
On Thursday further pressure was piled on South African police as they admitted Botha is himself charged with attempted murder .
Police Brigadier Neville Malila told the Associated Press that the detective is scheduled to appear in court in May.
Malila said Botha faced seven counts of attempted murder over what news reports called a drunken incident in which he and two other police officers were accused of firing shots from a state - owned vehicle while trying to stop a minivan .
Pistorius , a double leg amputee known as the Blade Runner , has admitted shooting dead his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , 29 , while she was in the bathroom of his home on 14 February , but claims he mistook her for an intruder .
He denies a charge of premeditated murder .
Sitting in the dock at Pretoria magistrates court for his bail hearing , Pistorius looked more calm and composed than at any point so far , while the smiles on his family 's faces suggested that they felt momentum was shifting his way .
The lead protagonist in another day of drama on Wednesday was chief investigating officer Botha , who initially asserted that he had found two boxes of "" steroids "" in Pistorius 's bedroom , electrifying the courtroom .
But he hastily corrected himself to say "" two boxes of testosterone , needles and injections "" .
Later , questioned by advocate Barry Roux for the defence , Botha had to admit he could not be certain of the contents .
Roux said it was a "" herbal remedy "" called testo - compositum co - enzyme used by many athletes , insisting : "" It is not a steroid and it is not a banned substance . ""
The state prosecutor 's office later said there was an error in the detective 's testimony when he identified the substance as testosterone .
Medupe Simasiku , a spokesman for South Africa 's national prosecution agency , said it was too early to identify the substance as it is still undergoing laboratory tests .
Roux piled on the pressure on Botha after he told the court that one of his witnesses heard a fight – "" two people talking loudly at each other "" – between 2 am and 3 am on 14 February .
Questioned by Roux , he conceded the witness had not identified the voices as belonging to Pistorius and Steenkamp – and lived 600 metres away in a gated community .
There was a collective murmur from Pistorius 's family .
Botha later changed his estimate to 300 metres when questioned by the prosecution .
Botha acknowledged that Pistorius 's legal team had also found a spent bullet cartridge in the toilet bowl in the bathroom that his officers had not .
He also confronted Botha , saying : "" You were in the house walking with unprotected shoes .
That should not happen . ""
Botha conceded that it should not .
Botha said police found two iPhones in the bathroom and two BlackBerrys in the bedroom , adding that none had been used to phone for help after the shooting .
But Roux claimed the defence team had another phone in its possession that the police had failed to request .
"" Why did you not come to us and ask for Pistorius 's cellphone number ? "" he asked .
Roux also took him to task for failing to check Pistorius 's claim that he phoned the Netcare hospital at 3.20am .
Botha said ammunition for a .38-calibre weapon had been found at the house but Pistorius did not hold a licence for it . ""
Did you take steps to find out who the owner of the ammunition was ? ""
Roux asked .
Botha replied : "" No , I did n't . ""
He also acknowledged that his investigators did not take photographs of the ammunition and allowed Pistorius 's friends at the scene to take the cartridges away .
Wilting under pressure , Botha conceded that he had initially said there would be "" no problem "" with Pistorius receiving bail but changed his mind after talking to forensics about "" how it went down "" .
Yet asked repeatedly by Roux if he found anything at the scene inconsistent with the account presented by Pistorius in court on Tuesday , Botha confessed that he had not .
Nor did he have any evidence to suggest the couple were not in love .
Police "" take every piece of evidence and try to extract the most possibly negative connotation and present it to the court "" , Roux said .
The criticism continued at the end of his testimony , when magistrate Desmond Nair noted that Botha was opposed to Pistorius receiving bail on the grounds that he was a "" flight risk "" .
Nair said the accused was an international Paralympic athlete who uses prosthetic legs and whose face is internationally recognised . ""
Do you subjectively believe he would take the opportunity , on prostheses as he is , known as he is , to flee South Africa if he was granted bail ? ""
Nair asked .
Botha , who has 24 years ' experience as a police officer and 16 as a detective , replied : "" Yes . ""
That was met by an outburst of laughter in court , where the mood has mostly been tense and sombre .
The magistrate pressed : "" And if he were to flee , he may opt for a country with no extradition agreement with South Africa ? ""
"" It 's possible , that 's all I can say , "" the detective replied .
Pistorius , 26 , had said in an affidavit read in court on Tuesday that he and his girlfriend had gone to bed on 13 February and that when he awoke in the early hours of the morning he detected what he thought was an intruder in the bathroom .
He testified that he grabbed his 9 mm pistol and fired into the door of a toilet enclosed in the bathroom , only to discover later that Steenkamp was there , mortally wounded .
As on previous days , Pistorius looked vulnerable in the dock , struggling and sometimes failing to hold back tears .
As the prosecution ran through its case against him , he sobbed .
The court was again congested with criminologists , journalists and legal officials .
A sketch artist , Jaco Van Vuuren , could be seen drawing Pistorius 's face .
The prosecution argued that the couple had a shouting match , that Steenkamp fled and locked herself into the toilet and that Pistorius fired four shots through the door , hitting her with three bullets .
"" I believe that he knew that Reeva was in the bathroom and he shot four shots through the door , "" said Botha , adding that the angle at which the rounds were fired suggested they were aimed deliberately at somebody who was on the toilet .
One point of dispute is whether Pistorius was wearing his prosthetic legs when he shot through the bathroom door .
In his statement on Tuesday , the athlete said he was on his stumps and feeling vulnerable when he opened fire .
But the prosecution has claimed the killing was premeditated because Pistorius took time to put on his prosthetic legs first .
Botha supported this view , saying the trajectory of the bullets through the door showed the gun was fired from a height . ""
It seems to me it was fired down , "" he said .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel projected a plan of the bedroom and bathroom on to a white screen in the court and argued Pistorius had to walk past his bed to get to the bathroom and could not have done so without realising Steenkamp was not in the bed .
"" There 's no other way of getting there , "" Nel said .
Botha said the holster for the 9 mm pistol was found under the side of the bed on which Steenkamp slept , also implying it would have been impossible for Pistorius to get the gun without realising that Steenkamp was not in the bed and could have been the person in the bathroom .
Pistorius has claimed that the bedroom was pitch dark .
Botha cited another witness who claimed to have heard "" two - to - three shots "" , seen Pistorius 's lights on , then 17 minutes later heard another "" two - to - three shots . ""
He said : "" We have the statement of a person who said after he heard gunshots , he went to his balcony and saw the light was on .
Then he heard a female screaming , then more gunshots . ""
Roux again contested the claim .
Botha said Steenkamp was shot in the head over her right ear and in her right elbow and hip , with both joints broken by the impacts .
The shots were fired from 1.5 metres , he added , and police found three spent cartridges in the bathroom and one in the hallway connecting the bathroom to the bedroom .
Officers found the victim downstairs covered in towels and wearing white shorts and a black top .
The detective said that all Pistorius would say after the shooting was "" he thought it was a burglar "" .
Guards at the gated community where Pistorius lives did call the athlete , Botha said .
The detective said that all the athlete said was : "" I 'm all right , "" before crying . ""
Was it part of his premeditated plan , not to switch off the phone and cry ? ""
Roux asked sarcastically .
But the prosecution did land some blows on the athlete 's character .
Botha claimed that Pistorius was involved in another shooting at a restaurant in Johannesburg in January and , aware of the media storm that would ensure , asked the gun owner to "" take the rap "" for the incident , which he did .
Botha told the court of a further incident at a racetrack where Pistorius allegedly threatened to "" fuck up "" a man during a row over a woman .
As the day wore on , Pistorius 's brother Carl moved to the front desks and sat beside the defence team .
At one point he turned to Pistorius and smiled .
Carl said later : "" I feel like the court proceedings went well today .
We trust that everyone has more clarity about this tragic incident .
"" Kenny Oldwage , Pistorius 's lawyer , added : "" We 're very pleased with today . ""
The hearing was adjourned to Thursday morning when a decision over bail might be made ."
2013-02-21,"The prosecution of Oscar Pistorius over the death of Reeva Steenkamp took a dramatic turn on Thursday after the chief investigator , Hilton Botha , was dropped from the case following the revelation that he was himself facing seven charges of attempted murder .
Shortly after the third day of Pistorius 's bail hearing drew to a close , National Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega told reporters that Botha would be replaced by "" the most senior detective "" in the force , Lieutenant General Vineshkumar Moonoo . ""
I have decided to assign this very important investigation under the leadership and stewardship of the divisonal commissioner , Lt Gen Moonoo , "" said Phiyega . ""
He will lead the process of establishing a team of highly skilled and professional detectives .
They shall continue with this investigation .
"" Earlier , the South African police service confirmed that Botha and two other officers were accused of firing at a taxi carrying seven passengers during an allegedly drunken incident in 2011 .
When the Pistorius bail hearing resumed on Thursday , the chief prosecutor , Gerrie Nel , began by explaining the attempted murder charges to the court , stating he wanted to put matters on the record . ""
The case [ against Botha ] was originally dropped but now it has been reinstated , "" Nel said .
Botha was not present at the time .
The hearing was then briefly adjourned as officials looked for him .
Chief prosecutor , Gerrie Nel , joked "" there goes my case "" as Botha was brought back into the court .
The detective , who was not questioned about the 2011 incident , was asked to clarify some of his statements to the court about the evidence in the Pistorius case .
There followed yet another dramatic day in the hearing , with the proceedings briefly suspended again because of what was described as a "" threat to the court "" .
Pistorius has said that he killed Steenkamp by mistake , when he opened fire through a locked toilet door , thinking there was a burglar or burglars in his house .
The prosecution maintains that Pistorius , 26 , deliberately shot and killed her , and on Thursday Nel accused him of showing scant regard for her wellbeing .
"" You want to protect her , but you do n't even look at her .
You do n't even ask : Reeva , are you all right ? ""
Nel said .
"" His version is so improbable . ""
But perhaps the most dramatic moment of the day was the news that Botha was himself under investigation .
South African news reports said at the time of the alleged shooting in 2011 that Botha and the other officers were pursuing a man accused of murdering and dismembering a woman before dumping her body parts down a drain .
A police spokesman , Neville Malila , told the website Eye Witness News that the charges were initially dropped but later reinstated .
"" There was a decision taken by the director of public prosecutions ' office to charge the members , each one of them with seven counts of attempted murder .
That was the number of people that were in the taxi , "" Malila said .
The prosecution said they were unaware of the charges against the detective when they put him on the stand to explain why Pistorius should not be given bail .
Malila said police learned on Wednesday that the DPP had reinstated the charges against Botha .
He said police were waiting for details from his case file .
The National Prosecuting Authority said the charges against Botha were reinstated on 4 February , 10 days before Pistorius shot Steenkamp . ""
The decision to reinstate was taken on 4 February , way before the issue of Pistorius came to light or the murder of Reeva was committed , "" an NPA spokesman , Medupe Simasiku , told Reuters .
"" It 's completely unrelated to this trial . ""
The police force said they had chosen Botha , an officer for 24 years and detective for 16 , in spite of the charges because of his experience . ""
[ Botha ] is innocent until proven guilty , "" Malila said .
"" [ He ] was chosen by the station to do the investigation due to the fact that he is a senior . ""
The revelations come after serious failings in the prosecution case against Pistorius were exposed on Wednesday .
Botha struggled under defence cross - examination , wrongly claiming to have found boxes of testosterone in Pistorius 's bedroom and admitting that police had no evidence contradicting the athlete 's version of events .
The detective has been a central figure in the case against Pistorius , the Olympic and Paralympic athlete known as the Blade Runner .
Pistorious has admitted shooting dead Steenkamp on 14 February .
He denies premeditated murder .
Botha has been strongly criticised by Pistorious 's family , who have been closely following the athlete 's bail hearing from the court in Pretoria .
The detective was forced to correct the testosterone allegation , admitting he could not be certain of the contents ."
2013-02-21,"The case against Oscar Pistorius took another astonishing turn on Thursday when the lead detective investigating the case was sacked after being charged with seven counts of attempted murder himself .
It emerged that Hilton Botha , who had given an unconvincing performance in the witness stand on Wednesday , and two other police officers are accused of drunkenly firing shots at a minibus carrying seven passengers in October 2011 .
The case had previously been dropped but the charges against Botha were reinstated on Wednesday , as he argued before Pretoria magistrates court for Pistorius to be denied bail .
The long - serving officer is due to appear in court in May.
Botha appeared in court again on Thursday as the prosecution and defence traded blows over what happened on the night that Pistorius shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp .
A decision as to whether to grant Pistorius bail or not is due on Friday .
The conduct of the South African police is already the subject of a judicial inquiry after officers shot dead 34 striking mineworkers at Marikana last year .
With the eyes of the world now on the Pistorius case , the national police commissioner sought to regain public confidence and quell fears of a bungled investigation .
General Riah Phiyega announced that Botha had been removed from the case and replaced with Lieutenant General Vineshkumar Moonoo , whom she described as the police 's top detective .
She said he would be working with the head of police in Gauteng province to "" put together a team that is formidable to do this job "" .
Phiyega told a hastily arranged press conference : "" With the process of the bail application over , I , as the national commissioner , am appointing a new team to take the long haul process and Hilton Botha is not part of the team .
"" She claimed the police had been unaware of the charges against Botha until they were informed by the national prosecuting authority on Wednesday . ""
The matter that was being looked into , we were aware of it .
He was on duty , it has been to court , it was withdrawn provisionally , we now have a decision and we will co - operate with the courts and look at the outcome and deal with it accordingly . ""
She defended Botha as a highly experienced officer of 22 years ' service and said he was still a member of the police and had not been suspended .
"" We do not lynch people , "" she said .
Asked if it was sheer coincidence that prosecutors revived the charges against Botha on the very day he was in the limelight , Phiyega told the Guardian : "" I wish I had a crystal ball .
I would be able to answer that .
We received the feedback yesterday and I would n't be able to address you on the coincidence …
We will look at the decision and act appropriately . ""
She denied that the police had made an embarrassing start to South Africa 's biggest criminal case of the century .
"" There is nothing embarrassing for the police .
That is your judgment …
Embarrassing ?
I know Botha .
He is an excellent officer . ""
Botha told South Africa 's eNCA channel : "" I do n't understand why [ the ] case was reinstated .
I can only think this is linked to my work on Oscar Pistorius . ""
He added : "" My blood was never tested for alcohol in the aftermath of the shooting .
I was n't drunk .
We were trying to apprehend a second suspect in an office park murder .
The taxi tried to push us off the road .
We fired . ""
Botha was summoned back to the witness box on Thursday where he was questioned by magistrate Desmond Nair .
Returning to the Pistorius bail application , Botha admitted he had not yet obtained telephone or financial records for Steenkamp , and was told by Nair that there appeared to have been a lack of urgency in getting them .
Earlier , during the bail hearing 's third day , Pistorous wept as the defence advocate Barry Roux summed up his case .
Roux said poor quality evidence from Botha had exposed "" disastrous shortcomings in the state 's case "" .
He argued that Botha had been selective with what he said and determined to bolster the state 's case , but could not refute Pistorius 's version of events .
Summing up the prosecution case , Gerrie Nel said the onus was not on the state , but on Pistorius to prove he should be given bail .
He asked if the international running star thought : "" I 'm Oscar Pistorius , I 'm a world renowned athlete , that in itself is special "" was an argument for exceptional circumstances , and said the he wanted to continue with his life "" as if this incident never happened "" ."
2013-02-22,"The moment of truth beckons for Oscar Pistorius .
The Olympic and Paralympic star sat as if lost in his own world as lawyers debated what was in his mind when he shot dead his girlfriend .
A knife - edge ruling on whether Pistorius will be granted bail and released , or denied it and probably sent to prison , is expected on Friday .
The unenviable decision lies with magistrate Desmond Nair , who faces criticism either way .
If he grants bail , he will anger gender violence campaigners who are pushing for Pistorius to remain in custody .
If he refuses , Pistorius 's well - organised PR machine is unlikely to take it quietly .
On Thursday , seemingly testing the water , Nair asked defence advocate Barry Roux about the South African public mood .
There was outrage on both sides , Roux replied , and "" you can see the sentiment changing all the time "" .
Nair pressed : "" Do you think there will be some level of shock if the accused is released ? ""
Roux said : "" I think there will be a level of shock in this country if he is not released .
"" There were murmurs of support from Pistorius 's family in the public gallery .
The runner 's haunted expression and periodic fits of tears that have been at the centre of courtroom C in Pretoria magistrates ' court this week were in evidence again on day three of this drawn - out bail hearing , along with the now - familiar grey suit , blue shirt and dark tie .
But the 26-year - old 's brother , Carl , wearing glasses and a striped jacket , seemed energised as he walked through the public gallery , shaking the hands of supporters .
He spent long periods looking down at an iPhone and has begun using the Twitter account @carlpistorius to comment on the case .
"" How does the prosecution lie with a straight face , "" Carl posted on Thursday , referring to prosecutors ' warnings that the accused could be a flight risk . ""
Passport was tendered to IO !
I went to collect in Johannesburg upon the IO 's request . ""
He tweeted , referring to the investigating officer .
In a case that has already seen its fair share of revelations , Thursday 's hearing began with prosecutor Gerrie Nel making an announcement about the chief investigating officer .
"" It became known to me and my team yesterday that detective Hilton Botha faces seven charges of attempted murder and will appear in court in May , "" he said .
"" We did n't know this yesterday . ""
Nel wanted to put this on record , he continued , following media reports that Botha is facing the charges over a 2011 incident in which he and other police officers opened fire on a minibus with seven people inside .
Botha , who has now been removed from the case , was summoned back to court to answer further questions by Nair .
The detective , who had been on the ropes under cross - examination on Wednesday , fared little better this time , admitting a "" lack of urgency "" in seeking phone or financial records .
Roux , who had been Botha 's tormentor , then summed up his case . ""
The poor quality of the evidence presented by chief investigating officer Botha exposed disastrous shortcomings in the state 's case , "" he told the court .
"" We can not sit back and take comfort that he is telling the truth . ""
He said Botha was determined to "" bolster the state 's case "" , but could not refute the double - amputee runner 's account that when he shot model Reeva Steenkamp , 29 , it was because he believed her to be a burglar .
Roux also raised the issue of intent , saying the killing was not "" pre - planned "" , and referred to a "" loving relationship "" between the two and , after she was shot , evidence suggesting that Pistorius was desperate to save her life .
He said an autopsy showed that Steenkamp 's bladder was empty , suggesting she had gone to use the toilet as Pistorius had claimed .
Prosecutors claim Steenkamp had fled to the toilet to avoid an enraged Pistorius .
If Pistorius had shouted about an intruder , he added , it was likely she would have locked the door . ""
The evidence is not that the applicant knew the toilet was locked when he fired the shots . ""
But Nel sought to claw back some of the gains the defence had made .
As he did so , Pistorius began to weep in the crowded courtroom , prompting Carl to reach out and touch his back . ""
This [ bail hearing ] is not the state 's onus , "" Nel began in his summing up .
"" This is the applicant 's onus . ""
Nel challenged Pistorius 's claim that he did not realise Steenkamp was no longer in bed as he rose to investigate the supposed intruder , shouting to her to call the police . ""
You want to protect her , but you do n't even look at her .
You do n't even ask : ' Reeva , are you all right ? '
His version is so improbable . ""
He continued : "" His actions are indicative of a man who was willing and ready to kill .
There were two people in the house .
One survived to give his version . ""
He fired four shots , not one shot .
The only reason you fire four shots is to kill .
On his own version , he 's bound to be convicted . ""
Nel added : "" No court will ever accept that the applicant acted in self - defence . ""
He said signs of remorse from Pistorius do not mean that the athlete had not intended to kill his girlfriend . ""
Even if you plan a murder , you plan a murder and shoot .
If you fire the shot , you have remorse .
Remorse might kick in immediately . ""
Speculating if there could be exceptional circumstances for bail , he said : "" ' I am Oscar Pistorius .
I am a world - renowned athlete . '
Is that a special circumstance ?
No . ""
He said the star wanted to continue with his life "" as if this incident never happened ...
This total lack of insight and willingness to take responsibility for his deeds increases his flight risk . ""
He said Pistorius had not given guarantees to the court that he would not leave the country if he was facing a life sentence .
Nel also stressed that Pistorius should not be given special treatment .
The court should focus on the "" murder of the defenceless woman "" , Nel added ."
2013-02-22,"Oscar Pistorius has been released on bail at the end of a tense hearing which has gripped South Africa and the world .
There was no sign of joy from the Olympian and Paralympian who continued to sob and looked plunged into despair as the magistrate read out his decision on Friday .
But there were smiles of relief from Pistorius 's family , who gathered in a circle to pray , and a shout of "" yes ! "" from friends who leaped to their feet in the charged courtroom .
Magistrate Desmond Nair set the bail at 1 m rand ( £ 73,000 ) and said Pistorius must hand over his passports and also turn in any other guns he owns .
The Paralympian 's next court appearance was scheduled for 4 June .
The magistrate also ruled he could not return to his home , where the killing of Steenkamp took place .
Speaking on behalf of Pistorius 's family , his uncle Arnold told reporters : "" We are relieved of the fact that Oscar got bail today .
But at the same time we are in mourning for the death of Reeva with her family .
"" We are also grateful for the magistrate for coming to the conclusion and for our legal team that has delivered extremely professional and legal statements that led to the decision of giving bail today . "" As the family , we know Oscar 's version of what happened that tragic night
and we know that that is the truth and that will prevail in the coming court case . ""
Nair made the ruling after four days of arguments from prosecution and defence in Pistorius 's bail hearing .
Nair said Pistorius 's affidavit , in which he gave his version of the events of the shooting on morning of 14 February in a sworn statement , had helped his application for bail in Pretoria magistrate 's court . ""
That reaching out in the affidavit , the way that he did , placing it before the court , "" Nair said .
"" I come to the conclusion that the accused has made a case to be released on bail . ""
During the hearing , prosecutors said Pistorius , 26 , committed premeditated murder when he fired four shots into a locked bathroom door , hitting his girlfriend cowering on the other side .
Steenkamp , 29 , sustained gunshot wounds to her head , hip and arm .
Pistorius ' defence team argued the killing was a tragic mistake , saying the athlete had mistaken Steenkamp for an intruder .
They said he was too famous to pose a flight risk and deserved bail to prepare for a case that has drawn worldwide attention . ""
He can never go anywhere unnoticed , "" his lawyer Barry Roux told the court on Friday .
The athlete 's lower legs were amputated in infancy but he races on carbon fibre blades .
Pistorius faces life in prison if convicted of premeditated murder .
Oscar Pistorius 's bail conditions Upon payment of the 100,000 rand ( £ 73,000 ) Pistorius must be released with the following conditions :

2013-02-22,"Prisoner A is a paraplegic man awaiting trial who , like a third of all South African inmates , has not been found guilty of any crime .
Despite the presumption of innocence , the country 's 46,000 remand detainees endure far worse living conditions than sentenced offenders .
With all eyes on the South African justice system in light of the Oscar Pistorius case , one man explains what it 's like inside the prison system for people with disabilities .
This is his story : "" I 'm a 50-year - old paraplegic and have been awaiting trial for more than two years since my arrest on fraud charges in December 2011 .
I ca n't walk , I ca n't control my bowel or bladder and have to wear disposable baby nappies which my family buy for me .
I ca n't feel a thing from my waist down .
I 'm paralysed from level four and do n't have a wheelchair .
"" My co - accused all got bail .
The main reason I never applied for bail was because I knew I could n't afford it .
My family have managed to raise some money now
and I 'm hoping for a hearing soon .
Even my 1,400 rand [ £ 103 ] disability grant , which I used for my seven - year - old daughter 's schooling , has stopped .
I asked a social worker here to help me renew it
but she said she could n't because I have n't been sentenced yet .
"" If I use my [ crutches ]
I have to pull my legs and throw them to the front .
That 's how I walk .
I was shot in my spinal cord , which was cut in the middle during a hijacking in the driveway of my house three years before my arrest .
Before I was transferred here I was in Johannesburg prison , where the doctor prescribed a wheelchair for me .
The doctor here says I must get a wheelchair from an outside hospital but has n't referred me . ""
Living here is very hard .
We are 88 men in this cell which is meant for 32 .
Sometimes there are more .
Twelve people sleep in two bunks pushed together , that 's six on the top and six on the bottom .
I have my own bed on the bottom , which is a privilege .
Luckily , I do n't have to share because of my medical status .
"" There are eight or 10 people with TB in this cell and four or five we know are HIV - positive .
A guy with multi - drug resistant TB sleeps on top of me .
I feel vulnerable all the time .
Not because I 'm threatened physically but because I 'm always called names and treated like an alien .
I 'd rather die than be here .
"" I ca n't rely on other inmates for help because they change all the time .
People come and go so I have to help myself .
My upper body is very strong so I just pull my legs along the floor .
There 's only one toilet and one shower for this cell .
It 's so crowded people even sleep on ' sponges ' on the toilet floor .
Sometimes there 's no water in the toilet and it does n't work .
The smell and the flies are horrible .
The food in the kitchen is also covered in flies .
"" It 's a big mission for me to get food .
It takes 30 minutes to drag my legs to the kitchen .
That 's why I do n't have breakfast , I just drink water .
I only go to the kitchen once a day for lunch , which is at 11 am .
The warders in the kitchen wo n't allow other prisoners to bring me food .
They say I have to fetch it myself .
"" I ca n't get the right diet here .
Prison food is not good for me or anyone with special needs like mine .
It gives me indigestion .
When I asked for special food and complained about my diet , I was told DCS [ the Department of Correctional Services ] had to get recommendations from a dietician .
Then I was told the prison budget was 11 rand per prisoner a day – for three meals – and they could n't afford to give me what I need .
Awaiting trial prisoners are only allowed non - contact visitors during the week .
You have to speak to your family through a microphone from behind a glass
and you get a maximum of 30 minutes .
My family can only visit at weekends because of work .
"" I made a special request for a visit last Saturday which was granted .
It was the first time my wife has visited me since 2011 because it 's so expensive to come here from Joburg .
It cost her 1,500 rand for transport and she also brought me 500 rands ' worth of food , nappies and medicine .
The captain in charge said I was n't allowed food , only nappies .
When I complained , he cut my visit short .
I saw my wife for about three minutes .
"" There 's no proper prison hospital here and prisoners die in the cells because they ca n't get medical attention .
When I had very bad indigestion and was shitting blood , it took a week for me to get to the prison hospital .
I have n't been given any medication since getting here , not even a Brufen .
"" I have to wash my pressure wounds and sores twice a day .
I ca n't even get swabs or bandages .
The last time I asked for Savlon , I was told to wash my wounds with salt water .
I 'm in constant pain .
Sleep is the only escape .
I 've only seen a doctor here once , in September last year , and he prescribed medical shoes for me .
I 'm still waiting . ""
The prison hospital is worse than the cells .
The ' hospital ' is just a normal cell with single beds instead of bunks .
It 's clean , has a tiled floor and is n't as crowded as a cell .
That 's the only difference .
Actually , my cell bed is better than a hospital bed .
"" If you 're sick today , you might see a doctor next week .
If you need a painkiller you 'll have to wait a week till the doctor comes .
Then you wo n't get medicine .
Not because the doctor does n't want to give you medicine but because there is n't any . ""
The independent prison visitors of the judicial inspectorate do come here to take complaints , but then nothing happens .
Some warders try to help me but others ask me why I think I 'm so special and require different treatment .
Living in these conditions means I 've been sentenced before I am sentenced . ""
Britta Rotmann , at the department of correctional services , said : "" We are bound by various sections of the constitution and have very clear policies of our own regarding people with disabilities .
Anyone coming into the system will be assessed and appropriate decisions made .
"" Every decision must take into account the security and dignity of the person .
We have no control over where an inmate will be sent .
This is the decision of the judicial officer and an assessment will be made in terms of the inmates needs and what accommodation is available . ""
Each disability is treated uniquely , said Rottman , adding : "" We have blind people who are placed where they can be assisted and also people in wheelchairs .
A judicial official will make the call and we will act on the warrant .
If we have ( the man 's ) details we will investigate all allegations and assess whether he qualifies for a referral . ""
The conditions of detention are our issue and I have said that medical needs must be met within the realms of possibility .
Further comment and assistance to the inmate should he need it , would require his details . ""

2013-02-22,"When the long - awaited decision came , the only man in the packed courtroom who did not seem seized by the moment was Oscar Pistorius himself .
His family members smiled and joined in a circle of prayer .
His friends leaped to their feet , punched the air and shouted "" Yes ! ""
Journalists thronging the court eagerly shared the news on Twitter .
But at the centre of it all , Pistorius remained utterly isolated , plunged into a seemingly bottomless pit of despair .
There was little sign of joy on the face of the London Olympic and Paralympic star , who had spent most of the day with jaw clenched , swallowing hard or sobbing softly .
"" I come to the conclusion that the accused has made a case to be released on bail , "" magistrate Desmond Nair said at the end of a near two - hour summing up , praising Pistorius for having offered a detailed affidavit which "" reached out to meet the state 's case "" .
The court set bail at 1 m rand ( £ 73,000 ) and postponed the case until 4 June , leaving Pistorius 's life and career in an agonising limbo .
The 26-year - old left the courthouse in a silver Land Rover , sitting in the rear , tailed by a motorcycle with a TV cameraman aboard .
A media bidding war for the first interview is predicted .
His lawyer , Kenny Oldwage , said that after his release from custody , Pistorius "" will be in a residence we 've provided in Pretoria "" .
The star 's coach , Ampie Louw , was quoted saying he is considering putting the athlete back in training "" to get his mind clear "" .
Pistorius has been ordered to hand over firearms and passports , avoid his home and all witnesses in the case , report to a police station twice a week , and not to drink alcohol .
He is not permitted to enter any international airport departure hall .
The magistrate 's decision came after four days of twists and turns in a case that has gripped the world .
Pistorius admitted shooting dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp at his luxury home near Pretoria on 14 February , but claimed he thought she was a burglar .
The prosecution insist it was premeditated murder while the defence argue culpable homicide .
After the steel gate clanked open allowing Pistorius into the dock on Friday , he stood still with eyes closed , head bowed , apparently in prayer as cameras clicked and flashed around him .
Nair complained that such spectacles made Pistorius look like "" some kind of species the world has never seen before "" .
The magistrate admitted he was in an "" unenviable position "" in deciding bail .
The case has polarised South Africans with either result bound to be controversial .
Nair made clear that bail was not a matter of guilt and innocence but determining whether justice would be served by holding a defendant in custody .
As Nair ran through Pistorius 's version of events , the athlete lost the battle with his emotions and wept silently , his hands trembling , at the words : "" She died in his arms "" .
Dissecting the prosecution case , Nair said Hilton Botha , the detective leading the investigation , had made "" several errors and concessions "" during cross - examination .
Nair said the officer had not asked for all the mobile phones , may have contaminated the crime scene , "" blundered "" on the description of substances found at the property , and did not spend as long as he ought to have if he wanted to establish that the athlete had a propensity to violence .
Botha was replaced as lead investigator on Thursday after he was charged with multiple counts of attempted murder for shooting at a minibus .
Police say he has been replaced by South Africa 's "" top detective "" .
In a sign that the trial could be very different , Nair cautioned : "" It can never be said that warrant officer Hilton Botha is the state case .
The state case will be put together by experts . ""
Nair said there were several grounds on which bail can be denied , one of which is whether the defendant is prone to violence .
He said this had not been proven despite reference to an incident in which Pistorius allegedly threatened to break a man 's legs .
Another is if the defendant poses a flight risk , an issue which brought the Blade Runner 's disability and hi - tech artificial legs into the spotlight .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said Pistorius has the "" money , means and motive "" to flee if given bail , and described how WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is just as well known but skipped bail by seeking refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy .
But Nair asked : "" What kind of life would he lead , a person who has to use prostheses , if he has to flee "" and is "" ducking and diving every day "" on artificial legs . ""
His international career would be over in any event . ""
"" A life not in prison , "" Nel replied simply .
Defence advocate Barry Roux contended : "" Mr Pistorius , every time he goes through security at airport , there 's commotion …
He can not go unnoticed through airport security
…
He can never go anywhere unnoticed . ""
He added : "" Those legs need maintenance and adjustment on a monthly basis . ""
Pistorius also requires medical attention for his stumps , he said .
Nair concluded : "" I can not find it has been established that the accused is a flight risk . ""
Earlier the prosecution had attacked Pistorius 's character and portrayed him as a cold - blooded killer .
Nel said mockingly : "" I shoot and I think my career is over and I cry .
I come to court and I cry because I feel sorry for myself . ""
He continued : "" I am not saying the planning of the murder of Reeva Steenkamp happened weeks ahead , days ahead .
I am saying the planning to kill Reeva Steenkamp happened that night . ""
He added : "" You can not put yourself in the deceased 's position .
It must have been terrifying .
It was not one shot .
It was four shots …
The degree of violence present in this case is horrific . ""
Nel also noted that the South African president Jacob Zuma had called for the law to prioritise violence against women and children .
He cited the case of Anene Booysen , 17 , who was gang - raped and murdered near Cape Town earlier this month .
In the absence of witnesses to the Pistorius shooting , however , Nair found the prosecution case rested on "" nothing more than circumstantial evidence "" .
But he also noted there were "" improbabilities that need to be explored "" in Pistorius 's account of events : why he did not try to find his girlfriend on fearing an intruder was in the house
, why he did not try to determine who was in the toilet , and why he would venture into perceived "" danger "" – the bathroom area – when he could have taken other steps to ensure his safety .
These are likely to be probed in the trial .
None of this , however , was enough to sway the magistrate against granting bail .
After the announcement , which was broadcast as live audio around the world , Pistorius 's friends welcomed his release .
Businessman Kenny Kunene said : "" Obviously I 'm excited .
I 've always believed in the effectiveness of the judiciary .
Fortunately the courts in this country are n't swayed by emotional or political factors .
"" I love Oscar , he 's an ambassador for the country and he turned his disabilities into abilities .
He 's a national hero . ""
Fubes Danor , who shouted "" Yes ! "" when the decision became clear , said : "" I 'm very happy .
I 've been hyperventilating this week .
We 've been friends for six years and he 's a cool dude . ""
Meanwhile in a magazine interview a week before her death , published on Fridayyesterday , Steenkamp , a law graduate and model , spoke about her three - month - old relationship with Pistorius .
"" I absolutely adore Oscar , "" she told Heat .
"" I respect and admire him so much .
I do n't want anything to come in the way of his career . ""

2013-02-22,"Judge Desmond Nair has granted Oscar Pistorius bail ahead of his trial for the alleged murder of Reeva Steenkamp .
Bail has been set at 1 m rand ( £ 73,000 ) , and Pistorius has been ordered not to return to Silver Woods estate , where the shooting took place , and to report to a police station on Mondays and Fridays .
These were the judge 's main reasons :
•
He did not think Pistorius was a flight risk .
•
He did not think the prosecution had shown that Pistorius had a propensity for violence .
•
He did not think the prosecution had shown there would be public outrage if he were released on bail .
•
He did not think the prosecution 's case was so strong that Pistorius 's only reasonable reaction were he released would be to flee .
But the judge also pointed out holes in Pistorius 's story that may prove important when the case comes to trial : •
Why did he not ascertain Steenkamp 's whereabouts ?
•
Why did he not verify who was in the toilet ?
•
Why did Steenkamp not scream back from the toilet ?
•
Why did the deceased and the accused not escape through the bedroom door rather than venture into the toilet ?
•
Why would the accused venture into danger knowing the intruder was in the toilet , leaving himself open to attack ?
He returned to the dangerous area .
What if the intruder was waiting for him ?
And he said he had difficulty with the defence 's version of why the accused slept on the other side of the bed from usual that night ."
2013-02-22,"It is much too risky to speculate about what exactly happened when model Reeva Steenkamp was shot dead in the home of Oscar Pistorius .
But the South African sports legend has been charged with murder , and has just been granted bail .
In a troubling twist , the lead investigator , Hilton Botha , faces seven attempted murder charges after allegedly firing at a taxi .
This raises the question : does South Africa need to interrogate masculinity and gun culture ?
As reports flooded South Africa 's news sites over the last week , it seemed as if editors ' sympathies lay more with Pistorius than Steenkamp as theories about an "" accidental shooting "" were quickly offered well before the facts were ascertained .
In fact , the Commission for Gender Equality claimed that the many reports on the death of Reeva Steenkamp shifted attention from gender - based violence to Oscar Pistorius .
Regardless of the circumstances of the shooting , the fact is that yet another woman met a violent end in South Africa – a country at war with its female population .
Earlier this month , Bredasdorp teenager Anene Booysen was gang - raped , murdered and mutilated – a case so appalling in its brutality that it made headlines across the globe .
And as extreme as this case was , such violence is not isolated .
In 1999 , 14-year - old Valencia Farmer was gang - raped and murdered .
At the time , we saw a great deal of media outrage at the incident – not unlike the response to the Booysen murder .
But , between these two horrific events , we have seen many other instances of gender - based violence that expose the hollow nature of the righteous indignation expressed by public officials , political parties and journalists alike .
According to a 2011 survey by Statistics South Africa , 38.4 % of sexual offences were committed by community members known to their victims .
Furthermore , 37.2 % of victims were murdered by known community members , followed by a spouse / lover ( 18.2 % ) , and friends / acquaintances ( 12.1 % ) .
According to allAfrica.com , police statistics reveal that in South Africa seven women were murdered each day in 2011 , and that one woman gets raped every 17 seconds .
What does this have to do with Steenkamp 's death , you may ask , especially when the true facts are not yet known ?
The answer lies in how stereotypical views of masculinity get rewarded in South Africa .
While the country 's gun culture is by no means comparable to that of the US , paranoia about violent crime in a post - apartheid era has extended the laager mentality that emerged during the rule of the National party .
( The term refers to the defensive circle created by the wagons of colonial - era settlers , effectively creating a mobile fort against attacks by indigenous Africans .
Settlers would hide inside these wagon forts with their guns on the ready in the event of an attack . )
Under apartheid , white paranoia about being murdered by vengeful "" natives "" helped the National party to consolidate its political power , as well as to justify the conscription of white males to defend South Africa 's borders against "" communists "" – shorthand for the African National Congress 's military wing .
Many white South African males were compulsorily drafted , and a large number of young soldiers fought in border wars with Angola and Mozambique .
In addition , the patriarchal nature of apartheid ideology created hierarchies based on gender as well as race .
Black citizens on the other hand experienced the structural violence of apartheid policies , and faced brutal repression in their struggle for civil rights .
The landmark murders in Sharpeville and Soweto were the tip of the iceberg – the disappearance of activists and the torture of detainees became a feature of everyday life .
This experience of violence went beyond racial oppression , though .
As feminist scholar Shireen Hassim 's research on Jacob Zuma 's rape trial suggests , the struggle for gender equality took a back seat to the fight against apartheid and , for this reason , women 's rights remain fairly low on the national agenda in democratic South Africa .
( Zuma was cleared of rape in 2006 . )
Today , brutal police action in Marikana , Ficksburg and Hangberg resonates with apartheid - era state violence .
More importantly , the evidence of the laager mentality 's continuing siege can be seen in the emergence of gated communities and rightwing organisations ' claims of a genocidal plot against white farmers .
This is notwithstanding the black South Africans ' experience of violent crime in the township , where the "" corrective rape "" of lesbians gives new meaning to the cynical term "" paper rights "" – constitutional rights that mean nothing in practice .
It has been reported that Pistorius was a keen marksman who did not hesitate to use his gun the moment his house alarm tripped – a characteristic indicative of the kind of paranoia that pervades middle - class South Africa .
Pistorius lives on a golf estate , which exemplifies all the elements of "" semigration "" to gated communities and the laager mentality after apartheid .
According to a 2007 report by the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation 53 % of homicides were linked to gun violence .
Whether or not the shooting was accidental , it certainly adds to a troubling set of statistics ."

2013-02-22,"The adventure began beside the River Trent on a warm , humid , summer afternoon when Nottingham 's evening newspaper warned of a sudden surge in local residents seeking medical treatment for mosquito bites .
It was 11 August 2012 , the day that , at the London Olympics , Mo Farah won a gold medal in the 5,000 metres , Usain Bolt captured gold in the 4x100 m relay , and Tom Daley 's diving earned a bronze .
Oscar Pistorius remained an international icon and commentators had started wondering whether football 's time in the sun was passing .
Only the most fervent Notts County and Bradford City fans were enthralled by the afternoon 's League Cup first round tie at Meadow Lane .
Played in front of 3,460 spectators , Bradford 's 1 - 0 extra - time win came against a backdrop of media disinterest .
No one realised football had begun re - asserting its own peerless dramatic capacity , let alone that , by taking the first of seven startling steps towards Wembley , Bradford City were en route to becoming the first team from English football 's fourth tier to reach a major cup final .
James Hanson regarded the tie with rare excitement .
Three years after taking a £ 250 weekly pay cut by exchanging a joint living as non - league Guiseley 's key striker cum part - time supermarket shelf stacker for life as a professional , he continued to count his blessings . ""
Notts County was a big match , "" recalls Bradford 's centre - forward .
"" They 're League One , so it was a chance to show everyone we can play at a higher level . ""
Once County 's Yoann Arquin hit the bar from three yards , "" missing an open goal "" , Hanson sensed opportunity .
"" I 'd been scoring in pre - season , I was confident and , when the ball fell to me outside the area in extra time , I hit a left - foot curler into the top corner , "" he says .
"" Not a lot of people knew I had that in my locker .
People talk about my semi - final goal at Aston Villa but the one against County was better — and look what it started . ""
Valley Parade routinely reverberates to chants of "" He used to work in the Co - op "" and Hanson 's life has changed dramatically from the days when his duties included changing the toilet rolls in the store 's staff lavatory .
Dubbed "" the Big Unit "" by team - mates , he still shops at his old workplace in nearby Idle and enjoys reminiscing about the first three months of his life at City when , forced to complete a notice period , he raced to the Co - op after playing centre - forward in time to clock on for Saturday evening shifts . ""
At first Bradford paid me the same wage Guiseley had , so losing the Co - op money was tough , "" says the 25-year - old , whose four - month - old daughter , Lexie , will be dressed in a miniature Bradford No9 shirt emblazoned with "" Daddy "" on Sunday .
Hanson and his girlfriend , Jodie , had barely begun shopping for baby paraphernalia when Garry Thompson 's 90th - minute winner during a 2 - 1 second - round win at Watford left Gianfranco Zola lamenting football 's "" cruelty "" .
When Phil Parkinson 's side went 2 - 0 down at home to Burton in the third round , two late goals from Nahki Wells , Bradford 's Bermuda striker and leading scorer , forced extra time during which Stephen Darby , once a Liverpool full - back , struck the winner .
Known simply as "" Ken "" at Valley Parade , the 24-year - old Darby is said to bear an uncanny resemblance to Coronation Street 's Ken Barlow and is regularly teased for being old before his time .
Wells seems cast more in the "" 18 ' til I die "" mould . ""
Nahki recently bought an extremely fancy new car but rather spoilt the effect by needing L Plates , "" reveals Matt Duke , Bradford 's goalkeeper .
"" It did n't look right but , after a few attempts , he 's finally passed his test .
Fortunately he 's a better footballer than a driver . ""
The former star of Bermuda 's Dandy Town Hornets recalls the frustration .
"" The most annoying thing about the UK is the driving test , it 's a ball - ache , "" says Wells .
"" I failed twice .
I just feel like some examiners here take their job too seriously . ""
The 22-year - old 's serious side involves devoting spare time to studying for a degree in international business studies .
The need to concentrate keeps his mind off the homesickness that scuppered a trial at Ipswich as a teenager .
"" I blew it "" , he concedes .
"" I missed my family and quit , but I knew I 'd made a mistake as soon as I got on the plane back to Bermuda . ""
Subsequent culture shock probably explains an undistinguished six - month spell at Carlisle two years ago .
"" Bermudans are spoilt , "" acknowledges the forward , whose life has cheered up since he began sharing a house with team - mates Zavon Hines and Carl McHugh in Bradford .
"" We 've got hot weather and a good lifestyle ; I 've never spent as much time indoors or watched as much television as I have in England .
Zavon loves wildlife documentaries , so I 've been seeing a lot of David Attenborough . ""
Parkinson understands why Ajax once coveted Wells . ""
Nahki 's an exceptional athlete , "" says Bradford 's manager .
"" But he 's also got supreme confidence and intuition .
When chances fall his way around the box , time seems to stand still for him .
He can get to the Premier League .
He 's got that arrogance strikers need . ""
Even Wells failed to score in the fourth round , a 0 - 0 draw at Wigan that went to extra - time and penalties before Duke eventually clinched it for a team accumulated at a total cost of £ 7,500 — Hanson 's transfer fee from Guiseley — by saving Jordi Gómez 's shoot - out kick .
To Parkinson the tie felt a little like an epiphany . ""
It kind of caught us by surprise when 5,500 Bradford fans travelled across the M62 , "" he says .
"" I can remember one particular moment standing on the touchline and looking into Roberto Martínez 's face .
I could see he was shocked by the intensity of our support and our play .
Afterwards I said to the lads : ' that 's why you came to this club , we 've seen the potential ' .
Things came together that night at Wigan . ""
Parkinson is good friends with Brendan Rodgers and , particularly , Alan Pardew , whom he once assisted at Charlton .
But the former Reading midfielder 's lifestyle is considerably more modest than those enjoyed by his managerial pals at Liverpool and Newcastle .
Bradford pay Parkinson a basic £ 52,000 a year but the 45-year - old , whose stewardship of Colchester United attracted plaudits before an unhappy stint at Hull temporarily derailed his career , retains a fierce ambition .
He has persuaded Julian Rhodes and Mark Lawn , Bradford 's co - owners , to invest precious resources in employing the fitness expert Nick Allamby as the club 's head of sports science and John Muranka as its sports psychologist .
During Middlesbrough 's Premier League years Allamby served as their highly rated conditioning coach and Bradford 's squad can not praise his input highly enough .
While Muranka works only with those who seek his counsel , several players , most notably Hines , once of West Ham , credit his influence as life transforming .
"" I remember reaching 32 as a player and realising I finally had the right mentality , "" recalls Parkinson .
"" I wished I 'd had someone around in my 20s to help me .
Psychologists play a huge part in other sports and players sometimes need help .
At this level they 're playing for their futures .
These lads are not on big salaries .
They worry about mortgages and supporting families .
That adds pressure .
In the Premier League professionals are financially secure , but these players are n't .
They 're striving .
But that 's the beauty of this team : people enjoy watching Bradford because these lads show incredible desire . ""
Appointed in 2011 , Parkinson embarked on a radical overhaul last summer , offloading 10 professionals and signing eight on free transfers . ""
Myself and my staff made lots of sacrifices through the close season to re - draw the squad , "" says a manager who recently rejected a job offer from Blackpool but will soon be out of contract .
"" We trawled the country meeting players and spent hours watching DVDs and being really thorough in our homework .
I felt Bradford needed players with real commitment and desire : people looking for a fresh challenge , not just there to earn money . ""
By the time Arsenal were defeated on penalties in a momentous quarter - final at Valley Parade which saw the score 1 - 1 after extra time and Duke saving from Santi Cazorla in the shootout , that summer of sacrifice was paying rich dividends .
"" When Arsenal equalised in the 88th minute and we had to survive extra time our performance typified the spirit I 'd brought into the squad , "" says Parkinson .
The fact that he spends more time than many peers getting stuck into ' devil in the detail ' mud - on - boots coaching and assigns countless hours to individual chats with players may also be relevant .
Buying success has not been an option at Bradford since 2001 , when they paid Benito Carbone £ 40,000 a week but were still relegated from the Premier League .
The memory of two ensuing administrations and an attendant tumble down the divisions should ensure that the £ 2.3 m accrued from a Wembley run replete with goalkeeping heroics is invested prudently .
Transforming his 6 ft 4 in frame into a formidable barrier , Duke shone again as Aston Villa lost 3 - 1 at Valley Parade in the semi - final first leg .
It was five years to the week since the then Hull keeper had been diagnosed with testicular cancer . ""
When I was told it was a tumour
I kept thinking it could n't happen to me , "" says the 35-year - old .
"" I tried to phone Hull 's physio , who was the only one who really knew what was going on .
But I just could n't speak to him .
The words would n't come out .
I was that upset .
I was in shock .
As soon as the word cancer is mentioned you fear it 's going to take your life .
It 's a horrible feeling . ""
A successful operation and chemotherapy preceded an excellent prognosis but , back in those dark days of early 2008 , Duke could never have envisaged Bradford 's odyssey , never have imagined himself performing further heroics as a 2 - 1 second - leg defeat at Villa propelled his team into the final .
Yet there he was sitting on the team coach as it swung out of Villa Park and hurtled up the motorway , music blaring en route to a casino , where Parkinson 's celebratory squad enjoyed "" several sherbets "" , rounded off by full English breakfasts .
Pleasantly tipsy and thoroughly euphoric , the players learnt their reward for reaching the final was a trip to Las Vegas in May.
What Duke terms "" the whirlwind "" of sudden , unprecedented media attention and recognition from strangers in the street was already under way .
It has gathered force during the past week .
On Friday Bradford checked into The Grove , a luxury Hertfordshire hotel regularly frequented by the England team .
Saturday features a reconnaissance trip to Wembley , where on Sunday the squad will wear suits handmade by a London tailoring firm whose clients include Jonathan Ross .
At last week 's final fitting , its normally ultra - discreet staff kept commenting on how "" humble "" the League Two heroes were .
In the background , Parkinson 's phone beeped non - stop . ""
Steve Parkin , my assistant , knows Sir Alex Ferguson and he had a really nice message from him , "" he says .
"" We 've had loads of messages from other managers too , mostly expressing amazement at our achievements . ""
Back in his office beneath Valley Parade 's cantilevered main stand , which steeples evocatively into the city 's skyline , he began reading scores of handwritten letters .
"" Some were from people whose relatives died in the Bradford City fire disaster in 1985 when 56 people lost their lives , "" recounts Parkinson , whose players will wear tracksuit tops bearing the number 56 and the words "" Always with us "" on Sunday .
"" There 's a unique bond between the club and the supporters because of the tragedy .
I 've had letters from a lot of supporters telling me that this is the game to remember those 56 .
There 's a feeling that , outside Bradford , they might have been forgotten .
So we 'll make sure Sunday is about remembering them . ""
Wells will recall a 57th absent face .
After scoring against Villa he displayed a vest reading "" RIP Tumaini Steede "" in recognition of his fellow Bermuda forward who died in a motorbike accident last year .
"" We were tight mates , we grew up together , we loved each other , "" says Wells .
"" He was so talented .
His passing has been hard for me
but I 've just totally put my career towards honouring him .
His memory inspires me to achieve my ambitions .
"" Any player who is not in the team on Sunday will be bitterly disappointed .
"" I 've got massive decisions to make before naming the team , "" Parkinson acknowledges .
"" I can only make calls honestly and explain the reasons why , but leaving players out for a game of this magnitude will be the worst part of my job . ""
Another , happier , but equally tricky dilemma also looms . ""
The staff are n't sure whether to accompany the lads to Vegas , "" says Bradford 's manager , eyes twinkling .
When reminded that Wells has vowed to "" definitely "" carry the cup on to the plane as transatlantic hand luggage , he laughs .
Nervously ."
2013-02-23,"Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius is expected to make contact with the grieving family of Reeva Steenkamp , the girlfriend he admits shooting dead at his home , his uncle said on Saturday .
The athlete , who is accused of murder , spent eight nights in a police cell in Pretoria before being released on bail of 1 m rand ( £ 74,000 ) on Friday .
He was driven to the luxury home of his uncle , Arnold Pistorius , who said the athlete wanted to reach out to the Steenkamps .
"" We do n't want to put him under pressure but while we were in the car , that is what he said , "" Arnold told the eNews Channel Africa ( eNCA ) . ""
The family of Reeva is in his mind all the time
and he knows his purpose would be to be part of the family in future .
"" It is not clear whether the Steenkamp family , who cremated their daughter last week , are ready for such a gesture .
The late model 's father , Barry Steenkamp , told South Africa 's Beeld newspaper that Pistorius would have to "" live with his conscience "" if he was lying about how he had killed her .
The athlete would "" suffer "" alone if his claims that he mistook her for a burglar were false , he said .
The warning came as what appeared to be Pistorius 's first public comment on the case turned out to be the work of a hacker . ""
Thank - you to every person that has prayed for both families , Osca "" , said a message on his brother Carl 's Twitter account .
A spokeswoman for Pistorius said : "" The tweet is not from Oscar or Carl .
We can confirm that Carl 's Twitter account has been hacked during this very tragic time .
We are busy cancelling all the social media sites for both Oscar 's brother and his sister . ""
The London Paralympic gold medallist , staying with his family at his uncle 's house in the exclusive Pretoria suburb of Waterkloof , was visited by parole officers and a counsellor on Saturday .
Under his bail conditions he can not drink alcohol , return to his own home or leave the country and must report to a police station twice a week .
Karyn Maughan , a legal journalist at eNCA who has been following the case , said : "" I strongly suspect his legal team will bring a challenge to the bail conditions .
There was a degree of shock from both the defence and the prosecution that the magistrate added eight or nine conditions that had n't been sought . ""
The condition that Pistorius be subjected to random alcohol and drug tests had caused particular disquiet , Maughan added .
She also said that , according to his coach , Pistorius was due to see a psychiatrist on Tuesday . ""
Apparently he 's not sleeping . ""
The 26-year - old faces months of anxiety and detailed preparation before his next court appearance on 4 June .
His agent , Peet van Zyl , played down reports that Pistorius could be training again soon . ""
Oscar 's got far more important things to worry about than training and that 's why I 've cancelled all his meetings locally and internationally , "" he said .
Pistorius was pursued to his uncle 's home on Friday by the media , who then set up camp outside .
Big - money bids are said to be coming in for his story .
"" Everybody wants to interview him , "" van Zyl added .
"" We 're not going to do any interviews at this time .
We 'll sit down with the lawyers and make a decision . ""
The double amputee does not face the future alone .
At the heart of "" Team Pistorius "" is his family which , it became clear in court , is deeply religious and close - knit .
When the magistrate ruled that Pistorius would be released , they shed tears and embraced in a circle , heads bowed in silent prayer .
Pistorius 's father Henke and brother Carl sat behind him during the four - day bail hearing , occasionally reaching forward to place a consoling hand on the shoulder or back of the trembling , sobbing star .
Carl could also be seen typing on a laptop or iPhone , tweeting commentary such as : "" How does the prosecution lie with a straight face ? ""
Carl gave a comforting hug to his sister , Aimee , another fixture in court , when she wept at Friday 's decision .
Aimee 's most recent tweet , on 19 February , says : "" Reeva 's family in my thoughts today .
"" But it is uncle Arnold who has emerged as the family 's de facto spokesman , talking to journalists in the courtroom and , on Friday , maintaining his composure and dignity as he addressed a massive media contingent .
Arnold released another statement on Saturday after the athlete 's first night out of custody .
"" This constitutes a moment of relief under these otherwise very grave circumstances , "" he said .
"" We are extremely thankful that Oscar is now home . ""
The family was coming to terms with the reality of Steenkamp 's death and Pistorius 's part in it , he added .
"" What happened has changed our lives irrevocably .
As a family it drew us closer together , supporting and encouraging each other , praying for Oscar whom we love and who remains our son , brother and nephew .
We have all been deeply affected by what transpired .
"" We are acutely aware of the fact that this is only the beginning of a long road to prove that , as we know , Oscar never intended to harm Reeva , let alone cause her death . ""
He added : "" We realise that the law must run its course , and we would not have it any other way . ""
The statement was released through Vuma Reputation Management , a Johannesburg - based firm that specialises in brand - building and crisis communications for clients such as mining firm Anglo American Platinum , Colgate and First National Bank .
It has begun the long process of trying to rehabilitate Pistorius 's public image by overhauling his website .
Oscarpistorius.com now has black borders , a statement about "" the recent tragic events "" and photos of Pistorius in action , smiling with children and posing on the front of the New York Times magazine .
It says messages of support are being received "" in the thousands "" .
Vuma 's four - strong team has taken over day - to - day public relations from former Sun editor Stuart Higgins , who was in court on Tuesday handing out photocopies of Pistorius 's affidavit to journalists , but then flew back to Britain and took a backseat role ."
2013-02-23,"The father of Oscar Pistorius ' dead girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp says the athlete will have to "" live with his conscience "" if he is lying about how he killed her .
But Barry Steenkamp said he may be able to forgive Pistorius one day , if the London Olympic and Paralympic runner is telling the truth about shooting dead 29-year - old model Reeva after mistaking her for an intruder .
"" If it did n't happen the way he says it did , he must suffer and he will suffer , "" Steenkamp told the South African Beeld newspaper .
"" It does not matter how much he has and how good his legal team is , he will have to live with his conscience .
But if he speaks the truth , I can perhaps some day forgive him . ""
On Friday , Pistorius was freed on bail but still faces charges of premeditated murder .
June Steenkamp , Reeva 's mother , told Beeld that she received a bouquet of flowers from the Pistorius family . ""
But what does it mean ?
"" she said .
"" Nothing . ""
She also said the Pistorius family must be "" devastated "" and had done nothing wrong .
"" They are not to blame , "" she said .
The paper reported that she wept as she described how she had hoped one day to play with her daughter 's children . ""
Now everything is taken away from her in such a violent way .
It 's so violent .
We just want to know the truth "" , she said .
The Steenkamp family has previously made no comment on the case other than to demand that Pistorius provide "" answers "" about their daughter 's death .
Pistorius , 26 , was granted bail on Friday and his case postponed until 4 June .
He spent Saturday at his uncle 's home in an affluent suburb of Pretoria .
"" We are extremely thankful that Oscar is now home , "" his uncle , Arnold Pistorius , said in a statement , "" What happened has changed our lives irrevocably . ""
His lawyer Kenny Oldwage said the athlete "" will be in a residence we 've provided in Pretoria "" .
His coach , Ampie Louw , was quoted as saying he is considering putting Pistorius back in training "" to get his mind clear "" .
Pistorius was ordered to hand over firearms and passports , avoid his home and all witnesses in the case , report to a police station twice a week , and not to drink alcohol .
He is not permitted to enter any international airport departure hall .
The court 's decision to grant bail , set at 1 m rand ( £ 73,000 ) , came after four days of twists and turns in a case that has gripped the world .
Pistorius admitted shooting dead his girlfriend at his luxury home near Pretoria on 14 February , but claimed he thought she was a burglar .
The prosecution insist it was premediatated murder while the defence argues culpable homicide ."
2013-02-24,
2013-02-24,"Pictures have emerged of a smiling Reeva Steenkamp arriving at the home of her boyfriend , Oscar Pistorius , on the night he is alleged to have murdered her .
The stills , taken from CCTV footage , show the 29-year - old model driving into the Silver Woods estate on the outskirts of the South African capital Pretoria just before 6 pm the day before Valentine 's Day .
The series of images show how , as her Mini Cooper car pulled up to a guarded entranceway , she held her right hand against her cheek and right eye , then broke into a broad smile as the estate 's uniformed guards greeted her .
Pistorius , who was released on bail on Friday at the end of a week of tense hearings , arrived at the estate ten minutes after her .
The Olympic and Paralympic athlete used a lane that is further away from the CCTV camera and which did not capture his facial expression .
According to police , soon after the CCTV footage was taken , Pistorius and Steenkamp started arguing so loudly that his neighbours heard them "" shouting and screaming "" .
The 30 seconds ' worth of footage was broadcast on Sunday night by a private South African television channel , which also broadcast a brief interview with Steenkamp 's parents , Barry and June .
"" It 's only Oscar [ and ] Reeva that know the true story , "" said her father .
"" All I want is that he must just come out with the honest truth . ""
On Friday , as well as ruling that he could not return to his home , must hand over his passports and also turn in any guns he owns .
The sprinter 's next court appearance was scheduled for 4 June .
During the hearing , prosecutors said that Pistorius committed premeditated murder when he fired four shots into a locked bathroom door , hitting his girlfriend cowering on the other side .
Steenkamp sustained gunshot wounds to her head , hip and arm .
Pistorius ' defence team argued that the killing was a tragic mistake , saying the athlete had mistaken her for an intruder .

2013-02-25,"Oscar Pistorius , the Paralympic star accused of his girlfriend 's murder , has reported to correctional services as required by his bail terms , his spokeswoman said .
Lunice Johnston of Vuma Reputation Management said the double - amputee athlete had visited correctional officers in Pretoria but she was not told when or where .
A big media contingent gathered at Brooklyn police station in the South African capital on Monday morning to await Pistorius , but Johnston said it was no longer a police matter . ""
The uncle , Arnold Pistorius , confirmed it is now a matter for correctional services , so Oscar has to report to correctional services authorities , "" she said .
"" I do n't know where . ""
Pistorius , who was released on 1 m rand ( £ 73,000 ) bail on Friday , is staying at the home of his uncle in the affluent Pretoria suburb of Waterkloof .
Pistorius is accused of shooting dead his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , in the early hours of 14 February .
Prosecutors say the pair had an argument before Steenkamp was killed , while Pistorius contends that he mistook her for an intruder .
Pistorius is "" considering "" whether to approach the Pretoria high court to ease his strict bail conditions , according to media reports .
The chief magistrate , Desmond Nair , ordered him not return to his home , not to contact witnesses , not to drink alcohol , to hand over all guns and passports and to check in with authorities twice a week .
Pistorius 's lawyer , Kenny Oldwadge , told the Times of South Africa : "" We are still considering our position and this is really as much as I can say right now . ""
It also emerged on Sunday that Pistorius 's brother Carl is facing charges of culpable homicide after a 2008 road accident that left a female motorcyclist dead .
He is due in court late next month ."
2013-02-26,"Everyone , I suppose , knows what happened .
In the early hours of Valentine 's Day , Oscar Pistorius , Olympic gold medallist , double amputee and a national hero , fired four shots through a locked bathroom door and killed the woman concealed behind it .
Pistorius claims he thought he was shooting an intruder , but the police have charged him with the premeditated murder of his girlfriend , the model Reeva Steenkamp .
The case dominated news around the world .
A Canadian broadcaster called it the biggest story from South Africa since the release of Nelson Mandela .
Which may say something about excitement levels in Canada , but not a lot about how these things play out in South Africa .
Because the oddest thing about the Pistorius shooting is that it is n't really odd at all .
Upwards of 15,000 times a year –
and I am talking of a good year –
a man reaches for a weapon , and someone , often a woman , will die .
The country shakes its collective head , shrugs and moves on .
When homicide is this prevalent , the story of a legless man who shoots his girlfriend may earn , at best , a paragraph in the papers because it has a piquancy that run - of - the - mill shootings tend to lack .
Yet the Pistorius shooting electrified the country .
Perhaps because celebrity always trumps tragedy .
The man who shot the model was famous for being the fastest runner in the world , "" on no legs "" .
He was an inspiration to other disabled athletes .
Big sponsorship from the sports companies had made him a wealthy man .
But I think the reason why the Pistorius case obsesses South Africans is because it is so embarrassing .
In the Valentine 's Day fusillade the quintessential South African way of doing things is mercilessly revealed : it is a violent way , founded on machismo , carried out with gusto and it ends in bloodshed .
It is a way that began long ago , in a country where the three Rs seldom meant reading , writing and arithmetic – but something closer to rugby , rape and revolution .
It is such a cause of anguish here in South Africa because it is the way things are done .
What strikes the newcomer to South Africa is the ubiquity of violence ; just beneath the surface of life run rivers of rage .
This may be so because , ever since settlers arrived and shot the first local people they met as a way of signalling their future intentions , all contacts have been conflicts .
It may be that , after years of enforced racial separation , people have no idea how to reach across the divide .
But it is also , I sometimes think , because people actually like it this way .
Violence is stitched into life and into language .
Pistorius 's website gets to the heart of it .
Until recently we saw , together with the injunction from Nike to "" Just Do It "" ,
the athlete in his green Lycra bodysuit bursting off the starting blocks , under the line : "" I am the bullet in the chamber .
"" There was an enlightening moment during the Pistorius bail hearings , when the prosecutor asked why , if Pistorius was not a violent man , he had threated to break the legs of a rival in love .
His defending counsel waved this away as nothing more than the sort of talk young people enjoyed .
He is right of course .
To read the sports columns is to find a celebration of roughing people up , knocking them dead and giving opponents a good "" klap "" .
The Afrikaans word may be translated as "" a blow "" but this does scant justice to its percussive power .
The term can cover anything from a "" love pat "" , to a mild slap , to a murderous beating , to a barrage of gunshots .
Much of the past four centuries of South African turmoil is summed up in this word .
The question is who gets to do it , and to whom .
It is the manly way of dealing with disobedience , disrespect or dissent : anything less violent is for women and wimps .
Africa , in the posturing braggadocio of tough - talkers , is "" not for sissies "" .
The Pistorius case has raised the glimmer of an uncomfortable question : is n't it about time we sent for more sissies ?
I grew up in Pretoria , as did Pistorius , and my home was in the eastern suburbs , close to what is now the luxury gated estate where Pistorius lived and where Steenkamp died .
I went to school a bike ride away from what is now the Silver Woods Country Estate , where the shooting took place .
Names are misleading in South Africa because in Silver Woods there was no wood and certainly no silver .
There was only a stretch of bare , stony veld , now buried under a sprawl of expensive security estates , golf courses and shopping malls .
I remember it as a prime site for fights between boys , a place to settle scores , out of sight of parents or teachers .
It also served as a battlefield where rival gangs clashed over girls and territory .
The weapons were fists , or stones , and sometimes we used catapults .
How no one was badly hurt is a mystery .
But that was how things were done , prized and celebrated .
Our local "" copshop "" was the Brooklyn police station , where Pistorius was held throughout his bail hearing .
Thinking back to those turf wars , where Pistorius 's house now stands , I do n't imagine the cops of my childhood would have done anything more than look on with fond recognition as we kids knocked hell out of each other .
After all , that was what boys did .
The Silver Woods Country Estate is the kind of suburban fortress , increasingly popular all over the country .
Most people know that it is poor South Africans , many of them black , who suffer most from violent crime .
But there is a widespread and well - founded fear of attack among the middle classes of every race , and these formidable clustered villages seek to address that fear .
They are the property market 's response to the murder rate .
Silver Woods is particularly proud of its solid electrified wall .
There will also be other sophisticated measures to keep intruders out : closed - circuit cameras , electronic beams , sensors buried beneath the surrounding wall , guards on the gates and armed - response teams ready to race to the rescue when a householder hits the panic button .
Despite all these security measures , most householders probably also own guns .
Pistorius used a 9 mm Parabellum pistol when he shot Steenkamp ; it was the only gun for which he held a licence but , as it turned out , he kept an arsenal of other weapons for which he had applied , but not yet been granted , firearm licences .
He owned two revolvers ( a Smith and Wesson 500 and a S&amp;W .38-caliber )
a powerful hunting rifle ( a Vektor .223 ) and three shotguns ( a Mossburg , a Maverick and a Winchester ) .
When this armoury was carted away by the police , withdrawal symptoms were swift , it seems , since a reapplication for licences for these guns was lodged just days after the shooting .
When strict - sounding regulations limiting guns are voted into law everybody feels good about it .
But the truth is this : guns are us .
Guns in the bedroom , guns in the glove compartment and guns on the brain .
About a month ago , Pistorius took his girlfriend into a crowded restaurant and at some point during the meal he fired a shot .
Happily , the bullet narrowly missed someone at the same table , and a friend loyally took the blame for the shooting .
None of the diners reported the incident and the restaurant owner hushed it up because Pistorius and Steenkamp were regular customers .
I see his point .
You do n't want your famous clients moving their custom to a more accommodating eatery .
When Pistorius pictured himself as "" the bullet in the chamber "" , he was being unusually modest .
Pistorius was n't just the bullet in the chamber , he was also the bullet that whizzed passed his fellow diners ; and he was the four bullets in the bathroom door where his girlfriend was hidden .
How many guns are there in South Africa ?
Six million , say some – a dozen firearms for every 100 people .
These figures , like the statistics on murder and rape , are unreliable .
Much had been made of how very hard it is to get a firearm licence .
The laws are strict , but there is little to suggest that anyone takes much notice of them .
As long as guns confer power , prestige and protection , people are going to get their hands on them .
There are those who want only the police to carry guns .
It 's a fine idea , but it seems to take little notice of how things are .
South African police officers are frequently murdered for their weapons ; and in other ways the idea is downright scary .
In the massacre of miners at the Marikana mine last year , the police used their weapons in a way that reminded everyone of the bad old days of Sharpeville .
If that were not enough , Pistorius 's bail hearing veered from tragedy into farce when the investigating officer who had charged Pistorius was himself charged with attempted murder for reportedly trying to shoot a taxi driver .
Not everyone who sets out to kill needs a gun .
It is tragic that the Pistorius shooting has pushed out of sight a recent murder so brutal it shocked even South Africans .
Seventeen –
year - old Anene Booysen was gang - raped and murdered in a little town in the Cape by a group of men who knew her well .
Her bones were broken and she was disembowelled .
They used no guns because guns cost money and the desolate back lots of Bredasdorp , where Booysen was killed , are home to people who struggle to afford food .
If you look past the heap of weapons Pistorius kept in his home , you get glimpses of the impulses that feed the culture of violence , make it so powerful and so matter - of - fact .
There are guns as a good night out , which Pistorius demonstrated when he went to dinner and indulged in a bit of gunplay between the starter and the sweet .
There is gunfire as therapy .
When asked by an American visitor if he often went to the shooting range at night , Pistorius replied that he only did it when he had trouble sleeping .
Then there is the even odder idea that guns promote good causes , and that firearms , graphically displayed , make attractive fundraisers .
Just days after the murder of Booysen , and shortly before the shooting of Steenkamp , students at the University of Cape Town hit the streets to sell copies of their annual fundraising magazine .
The full - colour cover showed a massacre reminiscent of the shootings at Columbine , but done South African - style .
Beneath the familiar outline of Table Mountain , a batch of blood - stained corpses lie at the feet of two shooters , one of whom aims a pistol , the other wields an axe .
The ( male ) editor of the magazine clearly thought it was fun , and admirers called it really "" edgy "" .
No one was terribly fussed : after all , this is South Africa .
But I did ask myself where , when depictions of murder lose their edge , do you go next ?
Then it came to me : perhaps next year 's student rag
mag will offer a commemorative rape cover – that would knock the punters dead .
Exactly 50 years ago , I remember that the Brooklyn police station endured a surge of notoriety only matched when Pistorious was locked up in one of its holding cells .
A Sergeant Arlow and his sidekick , Constable Hattingh , shot dead , without reason or warning , a black man they had arrested .
Both escaped a charge of premeditated murder but were found guilty of "" unlawful killing "" .
Arlow and Hattingh were given suspended sentences and hailed as heroes by government ministers , and by much of white Pretoria .
A remark of Arlow 's has always stuck in my mind : "" I only speak to a native once , and then I shoot . ""
Arlow was another who saw himself as the bullet in the chamber .
Pistorius succeeded in his application for bail .
This came as a disappointment to some – not least the ANC Women 's League , which picketed the bail hearings , carrying banners demanding that Pistorius "" rot "" in jail .
This is the same group that honours president Jacob Zuma for his tender regard for women – keeping their eyes averted from his past .
A few years back , the man who was to become the president was tried for , and later acquitted of , the rape of a family friend .
Zuma 's supporters outside the courtroom carried placards , aimed at the woman who had brought the charge .
These read : "" Burn the Bitch . ""
Julius Malema , now a fierce critic of Zuma
but at that time still a loyal supporter , threatened "" to take up arms and kill for Zuma "" .
When I consider the president 's love of the ANC "" struggle song "" Bring Me My Machine Gun , which he still sings to cheering supporters , it takes me right back to where I started .
The terms of Oscar Pistorius 's bail are stringent : he is to report to Brooklyn police station twice a week
and he is forbidden to communicate with potential witnesses .
Given the casual way young South Africans threaten to break each other 's legs , this is probably just as well .
In the period until his trial , set for June , he is not allowed to return to the compound where Steenkamp died But the house will be looked after .
Such is the murder rate that small industries have sprung up to tidy away the grim reminders .
Reports suggest that two sisters , who work for Crime Scene Clean - Up , are likely to get the job .
Known as "" the blood sisters "" , they will scrub away the signs of the Valentine 's Day shooting .
It is specialised work , requiring more than the usual household detergents .
The sister 's website suggests they have much first - hand experience .
Any evidence that may turn up , such as the spent bullet in the toilet bowl that the police failed to discover when they examined the crime scene , will be turned over to the authorities .
And that 's how it goes in South Africa : another day , another visit from the blood sisters .

This article was amended on 6 March 2013 .
The original said , in relation to an incident when a gun was fired in a restaurant , that Pistorius had taken the gun there .
The person who narrowly avoided being hit by the bullet has said the gun did not belong to Pistorius so that reference has been deleted ."

2013-03-08,"Soon after South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius was released on bail to await his murder trial , Ronnie Fakude – a paraplegic awaiting trial in prison – was pleading for medical attention .
In such acute pain he thought he was dying , Fakude begged for help to secure Islamic burial rights .
The 50-year - old Fakude , who is paralysed from the waist down , has spent the past 15 months in Bloemfontein 's Grootvlei prison facing fraud charges .
He shares a cell designed for 32 with 87 other men ; has to wear nappies brought in by his family ; and is forced to drag himself around on crutches without the use of a wheelchair .
Ronnie Fakude is Prisoner A , the man whose plight was highlighted by the Wits Justice Project in a story in the Guardian two weeks ago .
Fakude initially called himself Prisoner A because he feared victimisation by prison officials .
He subsequently became so ill that he no longer cared .
But since the story appeared , offers of assistance have been received from around the globe .
Following the intervention of the Wits Justice Project and senior Department of Correctional Services official Britta Rotmann , Fakude was moved to Grootvlei 's "" hospital "" section and put on a drip .
After members of South Africa 's National Council for Persons with Physical Disabilities read his story , Fakude 's life took a turn for the better .
"" We got a private doctor to see him last Sunday to ascertain the severity of his medical condition and had medicine delivered to him , "" said Therina Wentzel , national director of the council – an NGO funded mostly by public donations .
On Tuesday Hendrien de Klerk of the Free State Association for Physical Disabilities donated a wheelchair and offered Fakude accommodation in a specially - equipped facility , should he be released on bail .
Pistorius 's case highlighted the plight of other South Africans with disabilities behind bars .
Like Pistorius , Fakude remains innocent until proven guilty .
Unlike Pistorius , who was granted R1 m bail , Fakude did not apply because he believed he could not afford it .
His co - accused were granted bail of R15 000 , which was beyond his means .
Fakude said he was advised by the investigating officer and prosecutor not to apply for bail until the investigation was complete .
A date , 18 March , has finally been set for his hearing .
"" Living here is tough , "" Fakude said .
In his over - crowded cell , 12 people sleep in two bunks pushed together , six on the top and six on the bottom .
"" I have my own bed on the bottom which is a privilege .
Luckily , I do n't have to share because of my medical status .
"" I have no bowel or bladder control which is why I wear nappies .
I got TB while I was in Joburg prison , prior to moving here .
This means I have a compromised lung and am prone to infections . ""
Paraplegics need special diets .
I have indigestion because of the bad prison diet .
I also have ulcers which cause me terrible pain and make me shit blood .
I have one kidney and my intestines are sutured because of injuries from my hijacking .
I have pains and pins and needles throughout my body because I ca n't exercise or get physiotherapy . ""
Fakude is likely to stay in Grootvlei 's "" hospital "" until the conclusion of his trial .
But whether this is a better alternative to the cell is a moot point .
"" It 's just a normal cell with single beds instead of bunks , "" Fakude said .
"" It is clean , has a tiled floor and is n't as crowded as a cell .
That 's the only difference .
Actually , my cell bed is better than a hospital bed . ""
Fakude 's wife , Precious , says that even if the "" hospital "" is less crowded than a conventional cell , there is the added danger of exposure to infection — which is a problem for a person with a compromised immune system like her husband .
A doctor only visits the prison once a week .
Another Grootvlei inmate has complained of rats in the "" hospital "" at night .
"" At least the cells are too overcrowded and noisy for rats , "" he said .
The Department of Correctional Services has guidelines governing the treatment of prisoners with disability .
Departmental spokesman Koos Gerber said : "" There are more than 150 000 inmates in correctional facilities , many with some degree of disability - and there are many forms of disability .
Individual needs are evaluated and attended to in the centres where the inmates are accommodated .
Our main concern is that their needs are taken care of .
Any allegations that DCS officials are not applying our policies will be investigated and there will be consequences .

2013-03-11,"From the time the BBC gave Mentorn Media the go - ahead this was always going to be an ambitious film to turn around .
The arrest of Oscar Pistorius on a murder charge has , arguably , been South Africa 's biggest story for decades .
The cocktail of different themes – one of the world 's best known sportsmen under arrest , a beautiful woman and her violent , seemingly inexplicable death –
this was a story that was always going to generate headlines around the world .
The first challenge we faced was in assembling a team , both editorial and technical , that could deliver the hour - long film in a little over two weeks .
Such was the huge international interest in the shooting of Reeva Steenkamp , there were no available camera crews in Johannesburg .
We were forced to go further afield to Cape Town to hire the cameraman and sound recordist .
As is common practice in staffing - up such rapid turnaround films out of the UK , local expertise is essential .
The idea of someone from outside the country just turning up , making local connections , then disappearing back to Blighty with the necessary footage is simply impractical , particularly when the international media have descended and are hoovering up resources and potential contributors .
We were hugely indebted throughout to our Cape Town - based "" fixer "" , Karen Schoonbee .
Knowing just which friends of Oscar and Reeva could be approached saved us a great deal of time .
Providing the journalistic beef was Shekhar Bhatia , a former chief reporter of the Sunday Express and well - versed in liaising with police .
While they "" set up "" interviews , we filmed other material – general shots of Oscar 's gated compound and pieces to camera with the film 's presenter , Rick Edwards .
One of the all - important lessons about making films in a hurry is always to fill the day even as you wait for more significant elements .
That is not to say that everything went smoothly .
Originally , we had planned to send back the material to London to be edited , assured that our hotel 's internet could handle the transfer of such data .
Constant crashes and funereal speeds described by our cameraman as "" like Mozambique 15 years ago "" made us think again .
Problems when they occurred were sorted out by our London - based production team .
There have been other challenges , too .
The cost of archive , particularly for films that will be sold internationally , is sky - high .
And , in our case , it was not simply about money but whether the owners of footage of Oscar Pistorius would release it to us .
So , you will see Oscar Pistorius running in the 2012 Paralympics , but not the Olympics .
Years ago , a veteran of many quick - turnaround documentaries told me that there were two essential requirements for anyone contemplating this type of high - pressure film making .
The first was simple – "" surround yourself with a strong team . ""
The second – "" get it on air . ""

2013-03-28,"The sporting world seemed poised to give the cold shoulder to Oscar Pistorius after a court in South Africa allowed the Olympic and Paralympic star to return to international competition .
Organisers of major athletics meetings now face a dilemma over whether to invite the 26-year - old to race .
Many privately admit that they are reluctant to welcome Pistorius , who is awaiting trial for the murder of his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , at his home last month .
British Athletics declined to comment on the issue , but sources close to the governing body say Pistorius is unlikely to receive an invitation to run at the London Anniversary Games , to be held in the Olympic Stadium on 27 July , or at the Birmingham Grand Prix on 30 June .
Pistorius was a headline act at two prominent Diamond League meetings in the United States last year – New York and Eugene – but he is unlikely to be welcomed back to either this year .
Organisers for the two events refused to comment publicly , but one source said : "" My gut feeling is that it would be completely unrealistic . ""
The official line from the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) , the sport 's governing body , is that it will not dictate to meeting organisers which athletes they invite to their events .
But it is believed that any organisers who do invite Pistorius will risk incurring the wrath of the authorities , who fear an onslaught of negative publicity for the sport .
An IAAF spokesperson said : "" All invitations are at the discretion of the meeting organisers , and not the IAAF . ""
It is believed that the governing body is planning talks with federation members and key meeting organisers to dissuade them from extending an invitation to Pistorius .
One source close to the IAAF said their biggest fear was a small meet wanting to make a name by bringing upon itself a media circus .
Most of the meeting directors contacted by the Guardian said they needed time to discuss the developments .
Pistorius 's agent , Peet Van Zyl , said he believed that the athlete could rely on invitations to race from a number of supportive meeting directors .
"" I am confident that competitions will want him back , "" he said .
"" I have received emails from numerous meet directors who have been supportive of Oscar [ during the trial ] and said one day they would like to see him back on the track at their meets . ""
Van Zyl said he last spoke to the athlete a week ago , when a return to competition was not discussed .
He plans to sit down with Pistorius and his coach next week to plot the future . ""
Oscar and Oscar alone will determine if and when he wants to train and wants to be running , "" he said .
"" He has not been training for a substantial amount of time .
He 's a world - class athlete and if he 's in the right condition , then and only then will he decide .
"" Van Zyl described the prospect of Pistorius running in the world championships in Moscow in August as "" highly unlikely "" .
He added : "" We 're not going to force anything .
At the end of the day it 's his choice .
If he wants to run again , we 'll be there for him . ""
Adam Azzie , 26 , a friend of Pistorius since school , said : "" It would be nice to see him get himself together and get back on the track to be successfully competitive . ""
Pistorius could face a life sentence if convicted of murder .
He claims that he mistook his girlfriend for a burglar when he opened fire through a closed bathroom door at his home in a gated community in Pretoria .
He is next due in court on 4 June , and his trial is likely to take place before the end of the year .
The double amputee athlete was released on bail by the magistrate Desmond Nair last month under strict conditions including surrendering his passport and not returning to his home .
On Thursday his lawyers asked the North Gauteng high court for several of the conditions to be relaxed , arguing that Pistorius – who has been staying with his uncle – was effectively under house arrest .
Pistorus was not present in court .
Pistorius 's lawyers said he had no immediate plans to return to competition but he would probably need to do so in the future to earn money . ""
He has no desire to compete now but it might change and it will change , "" the defence lawyer Barry Roux told the judge .
Roux said Pistorius would not try to evade trial if he was allowed to travel internationally . ""
He is not going to run away and hide .
He is going nowhere , "" Roux said .
"" Why stop him from travelling under controlled circumstances ? ""
He added : "" Why would this athlete go to a country without extradition and go and hide ?
It is not as if the appellant is travelling for holiday in Mauritius ; it 's only to gain an income , there 's no other reason .
""
The judge , Bert Bam , granted the appeal , saying there was no reason Pistorius should not be allowed to leave the country if he was invited to compete abroad .
But his passport will be held by a court while he is in South Africa , Pistorius can only leave the country if he provides an itinerary of his travel plans at least a week in advance , and he must hand his travel documents back to the court within 24 hours of returning home .
The judge also decided that Pistorius no longer had to be regularly supervised by a probation official .
A ruling that he was not allowed to consume alcohol and could be tested at any time for alcohol and "" prohibited substances "" was lifted .
Pistorius was also allowed to return to the home where he shot and killed Steenkamp .
The decision to allow him to travel abroad was criticised by a friend of the Steenkamp family .
Samantha Sutton , who is close to the late model 's mother , June , said : "" I thought it was disgusting .
I do n't think it 's right .
I 'm shocked .
If you 've got accusations like that against you , you should be like anyone else , but if you 've got money and lawyers standing with you
it 's different of course .
""
Asked how the Steenkamps would react , Sutton replied : "" I do n't think they 're thinking about him .
They feel sadness .
What 's done is done ; he 's done the worst and they 've got to get on with their lives . """

2013-04-04,"Oscar Pistorius has been photographed back on the athletics track – by a group of school hockey players visiting a university campus .
Charmaine Koekemoer , director of sport at Voortrekker high school , said there was excitement in the school bus on 24 March when the pupils spotted Pistorius at Pretoria University .
"" None of us are in any doubt .
We saw Oscar training , "" Koekemoer told South Africa 's Witness newspaper .
"" As we drove past on our way out on Sunday at 10.15 , one of the kids screamed : ' There 's Oscar ! '
As true as Bob , there he was . ""
The pupils took pictures with their mobile phones and quickly distributed them on a mobile messaging app .
On Thursday the Paralympian 's agent , Peet van Zyl , confirmed that the photos were genuine , but told South African media it was not an "" official training session "" , adding : "" He said he just wanted to get a feeling of putting his legs on again and having a bit of a jog .
"" Pistorius , who is facing a murder trial later this year following the shooting of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp , told Van Zyl and his longtime coach Ampie Louw at a meeting on Tuesday that he was "" definitely keen to get back on track to resume training "" , the agent said ."
2013-04-16,"Police in South Africa have been forced to surrender 49 mobile phones that they used to snatch photos of Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius after his arrest on suspicion of murder .
The intervention deals a fresh blow to the police 's reputation and is indicative of the global media circus that surrounds Pistorius , with any picture of him a highly prized commodity .
Four official mobiles and 45 private phones were confiscated from officers on 20 February , six days after the athlete 's arrest in connection with the killing of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp , South Africa 's police minister said .
The phones were seized from officers at Boschkop police station in Pretoria after Pistorius was transferred between court and the station , Nathi Mthethwa wrote in a reply to parliament on Monday .
"" This action was necessary after it came to light that photos were taken of a high - profile individual who had been arrested , "" Mthethwa wrote .
The phones could be used as evidence in possible disciplinary proceedings against the police officers , the minister added .
He did not reveal how many officers had taken photos of Pistorius .
Pistorius , who is known as the Blade Runner , was initially held at Boschkop , a station near his home in suburban Pretoria , after being arrested on 14 February in connection with the fatal shooting of Steenkamp , a 29-year - old model .
He was moved to another police station for his bail hearing at Pretoria magistrates court .
The case has already raised questions about the competence of the force .
The former lead investigating officer , Hilton Botha , wilted under cross - examination in court during Pistorius 's bail hearing and , it later emerged , he was himself facing seven charges of attempted murder .
Botha was removed from the case and later resigned from the South African police .
He told South Africa 's Star newspaper that he was stunned to hear that his former colleagues ' phones had been seized .
"" I was involved in the case and my phone was never taken , and when I was there , no one 's [ from the detective team ] phone was ever taken , "" he said .
Botha also told the Star that foreign media had offered 458,000 rand ( £ 32,630 ) for a photograph of the toilet door that the athlete shot through when he killed Steenkamp .
Officers were also offered between 5,000 and 10,000 a picture by South African media organisations , Botha added .
"" If that happens [ the leaking of photographs ] , both the state and the defence 's cases could be destroyed , "" Botha told the Star .
"" I decided at that point that all pictures should be sent off to forensics immediately .
That way we had no pictures and there could be no leak . ""
Despite the intense public interest in Pistorius , only one image of the double - amputee runner has emerged since he was freed on bail on 22 February .
The photograph , also a mobile phone photo but taken by a school pupil , shows Pistorius wearing running gear and walking on his hi - tech running blades when he visited his practice track at Pretoria University last month .
Pistorius was granted bail of 1 m rand on 22 February and has since had the conditions relaxed to allow him to compete overseas .
He has been living like a recluse at his uncle 's home in Pretoria , but went out with friends for the first time on 6 April and was seen enjoying drinks at a restaurant in Johannesburg .
A family spokesperson denied there had been any inappropriate behaviour .
Pistorius is due back in court for a hearing on 4 June ."
2013-05-18,"Alan Oliveira speaks candidly when asked about Oscar Pistorius , the man who described the Brazilian 's victory over 200 m at the London Paralympics as "" unfair "" and "" ridiculous "" . ""
He tried to take all the shine off my gold medal , but it did n't work , "" says Oliveira .
"" After the semi - final , when I arrived in the Olympic village , everyone was coming up to me and saying : ' You know that Oscar is complaining about your blades ?
' I did n't know that
but we knew the regulations
so we were n't worried
, he could complain but we were right .
I think he was playing mind games to make me nervous or lose my focus , but it did n't work . ""
Pistorius 's comments had the reverse effect : Oliveira was trailing round the bend in the T43/44 final by some distance but following a remarkable burst of pace he edged past his South African rival on the line to secure a surprise win .
The eight months that have passed read like a bad movie script that has yet to reach a denouement .
Instead of debating the legal length of athletes ' prosthetic legs , Pistorius will soon find himself on trial for the murder of his former girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp .
"" I was sleeping when I heard about it , "" says Oliveira .
"" My coach called me and he told me the story , I felt sad , shocked
and I could n't believe it .
Now we just have to wait
, it 's not a sporting issue , it 's a police issue .
"" Life after London has been somewhat different for Oliveira .
The 21-year - old , who had both legs amputated below the knee soon after birth , is now a household name in his homeland and has quickly had to adapt to life as a poster boy .
He will race at the Great City Games in Manchester on Saturday , as will a number of high - profile Paralympians including Britain 's Jonnie Peacock , but any plans to make the transition into able - bodied racing , like Pistorius , have been put on hold until after Rio 2016 . ""
For now I want to focus on the Paralympics , to race in the 200 m and the 100 m , that 's the reason I train every day .
The Paralympics have so many good athletes , look at Jonnie Peacock for example , he is such a great athlete and a great person , "" Oliveira says .
"" Sometimes I wonder if I could be a national qualifier for the Olympics but maybe I could try after Rio .
It 's just an idea , let 's see , after Rio we could think about that . ""
Pistorius 's frustration after defeat in the 200 m last September was the reaction of a man unaccustomed to losing .
He apologised for the timing of his criticism , which came instantly on the side of the track at the Olympic Stadium , but maintains that Oliveira 's longer blades increased his stride lengths and gave him an unfair advantage , although the Brazilian actually took six more steps than Pistorius during the race .
Oliveira , though , is not dwelling on the row .
Indeed , when he recalls that night last summer , his memories are not shrouded in bitterness , but instead he remembers a seminal moment in his career that came four years after first running with metal legs .
"" When I watch a video of it I still ca n't describe how it happened , "" Oliveira says .
"" That night was for me , that was my day and every time I watch it is such a rush .
I was just relaxed , I was more nervous in Beijing [ 2008 ] but at London I was well prepared
, I was n't worried about who I was racing against , just ready to do my best and that 's what I did .
"" I ca n't explain – when I crossed the line and saw that I was in first I just had to control myself and not go crazy .
London was an unforgettable moment for me and for the whole Paralympic movement with everything it represented in the world of sport .
"" I have to thank God that I do n't have legs , otherwise I would be on a farm in the countryside , working in the north of Brazil just like another guy .
Now I am an athlete who gets to travel the world and competes with the best because I do n't have legs .
I have had to work to be the person that I am .
"" I am always looking on the bright side .
I always think I can inspire young people , able - bodied and disabled , and I 'm so glad that I can compete in the best competitions .
I have the right structure in place and my family supports me . ""
He continues : "" Paralympic sport has changed a lot here in Brazil .
People got to know it during London 2012
and I 'm recognised more on the streets now .
It 's a lot different for me since London .
"" I 'm looking forward to Rio and after everything in London I hope it is the same here for me –
the crowd supporting their home athletes .
I 'm really looking forward to racing in my home country and seeing people cheering for me .
It 's normal that when you win a gold medal that people expect you to win again and I will have to be prepared for that . ""
Oliveira does not believe that Pistorius 's murder charge has damaged the image of Paralympic sport .
However , with the South African having dominated the Games both in a sporting and commercial capacity for so many years , the future of the Paralympics must undoubtedly undergo a significant period of adjustment .
Pistorius won six gold medals and earned the right to compete at the Olympics before Steenkamp 's shooting in Pretoria in February .
Now , the Paralympic movement needs a new figurehead , but Oliveira wants to shape his own path rather than follow in the footsteps of an adversary .
"" I 'm writing my own story –
I 'm Alan , he 's Oscar .
It 's my history .
I still have a lot of work to do but if it happens it will be natural .
You ca n't just replace someone , it must come with my performance , "" says Oliveira .
"" The Paralympic movement will go on without Oscar .
It was sad and everybody feels shocked .
But it 's not going to stop the Paralympics . """
2013-05-26,"Oscar Pistorius , the Paralympic star facing a murder charge , was fined for unpaid taxes after being forced to declare his assets during his bail hearing , it was reported on Sunday .
South Africa 's City Press newspaper said the tax authorities audited and fined the double - amputee runner "" less than one million rand "" ( £ 69,169 ) , which he duly paid .
Pistorius 's uncle , Arnold Pistorius , gave only a four - word statement in response : "" Oscar is tax compliant . ""
His agent Peet van Zyl , speaking from New York , added : "" I am not aware of any of that .
As far as I know his taxes were up to date .
I did n't see anything from the South African Revenue Service to suggest otherwise . ""
Pistorius , 26 , has admitted shooting dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp at his luxury home in Pretoria in February , but claims he mistook her for a burglar .
He is due back in court next month .
The Paralympian declared in a court affidavit during his application to be freed on bail that he earned around $ 630,000 ( £ 415,265 ) a year and owned three houses and a vacant plot in South Africa with a combined value of nearly $ 1 m .
City Press reported that he owns another house in Johannesburg , which he bought for 9.8 m rand ( £ 677,856 ) this year
but this was not declared as part of his assets in the affidavit .
City Press did not say if that house was bought before or after the killing of Steenkamp at his $ 500,000-home in a gated community in Pretoria .
Much of Pistorius 's income is believed to have come from sponsors
Nike and eyewear company Oakley , which suspended their deals after he was charged with murder .
His family has denied previous media reports that he is facing financial ruin because of legal costs , saying in a statement in March that those bills are "" under control "" . ""
While the family does n't deny that Oscar 's legal expenses are massive and that he has sold off some of his investments , including his racehorses , "" the family said .
"" Oscar will evaluate the cost situation on a day - to - day basis and make decisions as required . ""
Prosecutors say Pistorius 's court hearing on 4 June , the first since his bail proceedings , will probably take less than 10 minutes and the case will be postponed until a date in August when it is hoped police will have finished their investigation .
Last week Van Zyl confirmed that the runner , known as the Blade Runner , will not return to the track this year .
"" It was always going to be a case of whether Oscar feels mentally ready to return to training , which he does n't , "" he said .
"" He would need at least 12 weeks to get ready for the top level and six weeks of competition . ""
He 's not mentally and physically ready at this time .
It 's better that he focuses on the court case .
He did n't talk to us about competing at any time . """

2013-06-04,"Oscar Pistorius should not face a "" trial by media "" ,
a South African magistrate warned as the athlete accused of murder appeared in court for the first time since he was bailed .
Pistorius was clean shaven and composed on Tuesday as he returned to the dock in Pretoria for a 15-minute hearing .
His case was postponed until 19 August .
But the magistrate Daniel Thulare used the opportunity to lambast the media – including those overseas – for threatening the "" fountains of justice "" and sanctity of South Africa 's courts . ""
Just like any other literate South African
I also read newspapers , "" he said .
"" It would appear there is somewhat a trial by the media houses of Mr Pistorius . ""
It would appear some of the activities may amount , if not to scandalising the court system in the republic , then to contempt of court .
"" The intense coverage of the case after the 26-year - old runner was charged with murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in February took many around the world by surprise .
A frequently cited explanation is that South Africa does not have a jury system and that judges are seen as less vulnerable to being swayed by reports .
But a series of articles and rumours in the South African and British press climaxed last week with the leaking of photos of Pistorius 's blood - splattered bathroom to Sky News .
Police said they were disgusted by the leak while the Pistorius family said it left them shaken .
On Monday , Britain 's Channel 5 broadcast a programme entitled Why Did Oscar Pistorius Kill Our Daughter ?
in which Steenkamp 's parents , Barry and June , said "" there is only one person who knows what happened "" on the night their "" terrified "" daughter was killed .
Addressing the packed court on Tuesday , Thulare said pointedly : "" It is important that we invite our colleagues around the world to make sure we all respect the processes of the Republic of South Africa . ""
He asked the national prosecuting authority to "" seriously look "" at whether any of the coverage of the case amounted to "" either a scandalous conduct towards the courts or outright contempt of court "" .
Earlier Pistorius , who has kept an extremely low profile since his release on bail more than three months ago , entered the court to a cacophony of camera clicks and flashes .
Wearing a grey suit , pale blue shirt and dark patterned tie , he stood straight - backed in the dock , hardly an arm 's length from 30 photographers and TV cameramen who turned their lenses on him .
Sitting in the public gallery , the athlete 's coach Ampie Louw expressed his discomfort at the scene , saying it was "" like he 's being torn apart "" .
At another point Louw gave Pistorius a thumbs - up sign , prompting the ghost of a smile in return .
The Paralympic and Olympic athlete also spoke with family members before the hearing began .
His brother Carl , sister Aimee and uncle Arnold , as well as Arnold 's daughters , were among those present .
In the absence of any discussion about the events leading to Steenkamp 's death , there was none of the raw emotion of previous court appearances that saw the accused repeatedly tremble and sob .
He remained expressionless for most of the hearing .
Pistorius is accused of murdering Steenkamp , a 29-year - old model and law graduate , on 14 February at his luxury home in Pretoria .
He claims he shot Steenkamp through a bathroom door thinking an intruder was inside his house .
The prosecutor Andrea Johnson asked for a postponement of the hearing to allow for further investigation of the case .
Thulare agreed , saying that Pistorius 's bail conditions would remain the same and he should return to court on 19 August .
By coincidence that date would have been Steenkamp 's 30th birthday .
Asked if he understood the magistrate 's instructions , Pistorius replied : "" Yes , Your Honour . ""
After the accused left the dock , his lawyer Brian Webber backed the magistrate , describing media coverage as "" grossly over the top and absolutely disproportionate "" .
He added : "" I do think we should follow the rules of court and respect the sanctity of the court . ""
The "" Blade Runner "" is expected to stand trial later this year or early next year .
Medupe Simasiku , a spokesman for the national prosecuting authority , said : "" We anticipate that before or by August the police will have completed their investigation .
That is when the trial date will be set .
It will depend on what is outstanding .
If everything is in place , we hope that it may be this year . ""
He added : "" The status of the investigation is currently sensitive .
We believe the police are doing a great job .
Up to so far we do n't have any doubts about the progress of this case .
Everything is on track and running smoothly . """

2014-01-24,"Richard Browne is the fastest one - legged athlete in the world but his mouth runs nearly as quickly .
In a time fractions outside his T44 Paralympic 100 m world record of 10.75sec , he explains that he wants to smash the 10-second barrier , be as big a cross - over star as Oscar Pistorius , and leave an everlasting mark on his sport .
And he is just warming up .
Browne has a reputation for not only stirring the pot but attaching a high - speed blender to it .
Yet the 22-year - old American , who competes in the Glasgow British Athletics International Match on Saturday afternoon , says he is more soothsayer than provocateur .
"" I call it as I see it , "" he says .
"" I got a lot of backlash for saying I was going to break the world record and beat Jonnie Peacock in the Anniversary Games
but hey , I did everything I said I was going to do . ""
Ask him to forecast the year ahead and Browne shoots further into the stratosphere .
"" I feel like 10.2sec is a possibility , "" he says .
"" After we did the Great City Games in Newcastle , [ the American sprinter ]
Mike Rodgers told me ' you can run 10.2 easy ' , so that 's the aim .
But by 2016 I believe I could be running sub-10 , so come
Rio there could be an amputee – myself – lined up at the Olympic Games in a 4x100 m or in the 100 m or 200 m .
"" Browne knows most people believe such hyper - accelerated improvement is impossible .
He has heard similar sentiments before .
It is tinnitus in his ears , something to tune out until he forgets that it is even there .
And why should Browne believe the sceptics , given the strides he has taken since losing his right leg in 2010 ?
Attempting to take refuge from a storm he slipped on a mat at a laundromat and crashed through the front - door glass , shredding his leg ; 14 surgeries later it had to be removed .
Browne overcame that hurdle .
Now he wants to clear others .
He says he is significantly stronger after months of winter training and in Glasgow intends to show it .
"" I 've been working on my technique because I do n't want to run like an amputee , "" he says .
"" I 've been watching people like Asafa Powell run .
He is amazing . ""
He wastes no motion .
If I can learn how to move down the track in one direction instead of all this rattling around , my 60 m time will be ridiculous .
I 'm already the first amputee to go sub - seven .
I went to 6.9sec last year , so I feel I can even go faster in Glasgow . ""
Browne 's only disappointment is that his arch - nemesis Jonnie Peacock will not be there , having suffered a minorniggle in training .
But he knows there will be other times , and more important duels . ""
The thing about Jonnie and I is that we 're both so young , "" says Browne .
"" He 's only 20 , and I 'm 22 , so we 'll be doing this going into Rio and possibly on into Tokyo .
It 's going to be a fun few years .
"" Browne is one of the star attractions of Saturday 's meeting which sees a British team take on Scotland , the US and a Commonwealth Select squad .
Also competing are the Olympic long jump champion , Greg Rutherford , the high jump bronze medallist Robbie Grabarz and the world 100 m finalist James Dasaolu .
But while Browne praises British athletics for being bold enough to include able - bodied athletes and Paralympians on the same bill , he feels that the IAAF attitude to Paralympians competing in the Olympics needs clarifying .
""
The IAAF made the comment that there 's 150 people who ran faster than my world record , "" he says .
"" But we 're going to see times this year that are going to make people change their minds about what is possible in amputee sprinting , whether it 's me , or Alan Oliveira or Jonnie going 10.5 , 10.4 or even 10.2 sec .
I think IAAF need to get together and get their rules ready for 2016 because , trust me , we are coming .
"" Few doubt that .
It 's just a question of how quickly they arrive .
Last year Browne took nearly three - tenths off his 100 m PB while Oliveira , the fastest man in the T43 category for double amputees , ran 10.57sec for the 100 m and 20.6sec for the 200 m .
Oliveira 's progress , in particular , has led one prominent sport scientist to predict the Brazilian could win a medal in the 400 m in Rio .
But while some are concerned that Oliveira gains too much of an advantage because , as a double amputee , his blades give him extra spring and power , Browne is not overly concerned .
"" I do n't care if you have one leg , two legs , three legs , four legs – running is running , "" he says .
"" I have to drive my knees and pump my legs with as much force as Usain Bolt , Justin Gatlin or anybody else who is an elite sprinter .
Over longer distances Paralympians have an advantage , but not in the sprints .
"" Gatlin was one of the stars , along with Michael Phelps and Lolo Jones , that Browne met when the US Olympic and Paralympic teams visited the White House after London 2012 .
At the time Browne was shocked that they knew his name .
Come Rio , he expects everyone will .
The Sainsbury 's Glasgow International Match will be live on BBC One from 1:45pm day 25 January"
2014-02-07,"The Barking Spider pub is long , narrow and gloomy , even on a summer 's day , with only the doorway and two small barred windows yielding to the light .
A shaven - headed man in T - shirt and jeans , with cigarette in one hand and helmet in the other , speaks to another in Afrikaans and then leaves .
A motorcycle engine growls outside and dies away .
Pictures of racehorses adorn the cream and pink walls , a flatscreen TV plays songs by Oasis and Kylie Minogue , and laminated menus offer English - style pub grub such as a full breakfast or fish and chips .
The owners of this modest drinking den in a remote South African village could little have dreamed that their destiny lay here when their daughter was posing on the red carpet and pursuing a career as a model .
Her name was Reeva Steenkamp and she was killed by her boyfriend , the Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius , a year ago next week .
The Valentine 's day tragedy shocked millions who regarded Pistorius , a double amputee dubbed the Blade Runner , as a hero .
He claims he mistook 29-year - old Steenkamp for an intruder when he shot four times through a locked bathroom door at his home at 3 am , a defence that will be tested in court next month when he stands trial for murder .
The case made global headlines , with Pistorius and Steenkamp portrayed on front pages as a couple in the mould of David and Victoria Beckham .
Yet for her parents , Barry and June Steenkamp , life has never been glamorous .
Their struggle to make ends meet offers a glimpse of a fragile white middle class that is a world away from that of models , sports stars and fast cars , and rarely features in narratives of South Africa in the outside world .
There are no pictures of Reeva on display at the Barking Spider , where black and white photos of horse races in 1930s South Africa , along with men 's and women 's toilets labelled "" Colts "" and "" Fillies "" , speak to Barry 's career as a trainer .
Likewise there is a wall of silence from most of her family and friends as the world 's media return to their doorsteps .
"" There 's been constant pressure , "" said Reeva 's half - sister Simone , standing behind the wood - strip bar one afternoon this week .
"" I 'll have my head on a block if I say anything . ""
She estimated that the pub could get anything from 10 to 40 customers a day .
Asked if she could confirm that the Steenkamps had bought it using money they were paid for two media interviews , Simone replied hesitantly : "" It will all come out in the end .
It 's all a bunch of hogwash . ""
Her mother , June , arrived and was more forthright : "" The trial is coming up .
Every single reporter has been in here .
This interview is over .
I would like you to leave . ""
Minutes later two journalists from an Afrikaans newspaper could be seen disappearing into the pub , only to re - emerge almost immediately and beat a hasty retreat .
While many in the community are sympathetic to the Steenkamps , the letters page of the Herald , the local paper in Port Elizabeth and one of the oldest in South Africa , has revealed dissenting voices .
The paper 's editor , Heather Robertson , said : "" I think the Steenkamps are beginning to be seen as money grabbers living off their daughter 's tragedy "" Port Elizabeth , in Eastern Cape province , was founded by British settlers nearly two centuries ago and a statue of Queen Victoria stands near the Herald 's office .
Car manufacturers such as Ford , General Motors and Volkswagen have plants here .
"" This is a blue - collar town , a motoring town , "" Robertson said .
"" This is the Detroit of South Africa , and Detroit is dead .
These are n't flashy people or your wealthy white middle class in Cape Town . ""
Cash - strapped and feeling hounded by the media after Reeva 's death , the Steenkamps moved 12 miles out of town to Greenbushes , a sleepy , traditional village of white smallholder farmers where black workers can be seen riding donkey - drawn carts .
It is evocative of another age . ""
Greenbushes is away from the South African story , "" Robertson observed .
The tightly knit community has welcomed the Steenkamps .
A 65-year - old businessman , who did not wish to be named , said : "" We are really putting our arms around them in this area .
Barry and June are begging for privacy .
They are going through a difficult time and their wounds must heal .
I think in a year 's time they 'll be new people .
Once the court case is over , they can start relaxing .
"" A local man has given Barry a piece of land and built stables so he can go back to training horses , while June has thrown herself into the pub and "" got compliments since day one "" on the quality of its food .
The businessman added : "" My son has been doing a lot of work there on electric fences and stuff .
One day she came to me and said , he 's an angel sent from heaven . ""
Greenbushes is ideal for the Steenkamps to find peace , the friend said .
"" It 's wonderful to stay here .
It 's my little paradise .
I think there 's no other place in South Africa with the crime rate we 've got : it 's almost nothing .
But it would be wonderful to bring the death penalty back .
The jails in this country are like hotels .
They live like kings .
"" There could hardly be a sharper contrast with Reeva 's career in the humming commercial capital , Johannesburg , where she advertised soft drinks and cars , secured a place on a reality TV show and dated international sportsmen including Pistorius .
Yet friends and admirers say she never forgot her roots .
Hagen Engler , a journalist and author who has written of Port Elizabeth 's "" prosaic , windblown glumness "" , knew her there and in Johannesburg , where as editor of the South African edition of FHM magazine he put her on the front cover .
"" Reeva was incredibly down - to - earth , "" he said .
"" She was like one of the guys .
I remember doing this photo shoot when she had to eat a hamburger
and she got tomato ketchup all down her arm
and she had a good laugh about it .
""
As a teenage brunette , Reeva took part in , but did n't win , several talent contests run by the Herald and its sister papers , as well as the Miss Port Elizabeth pageant .
Barbara Robertson , a journalist who helped organise the contests , said : "" Port Elizabeth girls are very natural and unsophisticated and unspoiled by the ways of the world .
Reeva was unpretentious and grew up with very down - to - earth values .
"" She moved to Johannesburg , dyed her hair blonde and posed for FHM , said Robertson , but she remained true to herself . ""
The front pages made out she was this brazen blonde with boobs hanging out .
She was more than a model .
She was Reeva .
She had studied law at university .
I do n't think she was seeking bright lights and fame and fortune .
She was spreading her wings .
If she got noticed , what 's wrong with that ?
It does n't make her a celeb - seducer . ""
Now Robertson is braced for another onslaught of interview requests before the first anniversary of the fatal shooting .
"" I was hounded by media from all over the world last year .
I did pull down the shutters because this is a small town
and we look after our own .
Port Elizabeth protected them ; nobody tells anyone who they are or where to find them . ""
Media inquiries are directed to a leading criminal lawyer Dup de Bruyn who has agreed to represent the Steenkamps pro bono .
"" They needed me , "" he explained .
"" They were really hounded and needed a buffer .
They 're very traumatised and , with all these days coming up , everybody 's beginning to phone and we 're trying to protect them .
There are more requests than I can handle . ""
De Bruyn said he was negotiating with Pistorius 's team over settling a civil suit out of court .
But one thing that remains uncertain is whether the Steenkamps will leave their remote village pub and head for the capital , Pretoria , to attend South Africa 's trial of the century , starting on 3 March .
"" We have n't made a final decision , "" De Bruyn said ."
2014-02-10,"South African detectives still do not have access to Oscar Pistorius 's mobile phone three weeks before the start of his murder trial because of FBI "" red tape "" in America , according to reports .
Investigators have been trying to persuade the FBI to back their request for Apple to unlock the Paralympic champion 's iPhone so its contents can be analysed , according to South Africa 's Eyewitness News .
Police declined to comment directly on the report but said they had "" everything we need "" to go ahead with the trial , due to begin on 3 March , in which Pistorius will claim he shot dead his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , last Valentine 's Day because he mistook her for an intruder .
Prosecutors said two iPhones and two BlackBerrys were found on the bathroom floor of Pistorius 's luxury home in Pretoria after the killing .
The phones are seen as potentially vital evidence because text messages could corroborate or undermine his account of what happened that night .
The double amputee , known as the "" Blade Runner "" , has claimed he forgot his Apple ID code , needed to log in to his iPhone 5 to access the messages .
According to Eyewitness News , investigators are still trying to get agreement from the FBI to help in the case .
This is apparently a prerequisite for making contact with Apple and gaining permission to study encrypted data on Pistorius 's phone .
The report said police had received supporting documents from the chief magistrate , Desmond Nair , and the director of public prosecutions , Sibongile Mzinyathi , and sent copies of the documents to the FBI three weeks ago , but the bureau wanted the originals before they considered the request .
Lieutenant - general Solomon Makgale , a police spokesman , refused to comment on the specific claim but said : "" From our perspective , our investigation has been completed .
We 've got everything we need for the trial .
Our focus is on the trial . ""
Anneliese Burgess , a spokeswoman for the Pistorius family , said she was not aware of the alleged delay .
Police were accused of bungling and contaminating the crime scene during Pistorius 's bail hearing last year , with lead detective Hilton Botha being taken off the case .
But last week they insisted they were confident of their preparations . ""
The case is going to court , [ and ] all necessary evidence that we needed to take the docket to court has been collected so far , "" said Major - general Tebello Mosikili , deputy commissioner in Gauteng province .
"" We have made good progress …
We are ready to go to court .
""
One hundred and seven witnesses are expected to testify .
Among them are 27-year - old Pistorius 's sister Aimee , his uncle Arnold , former investigator Botha and residents of the Silver Woods estate in Pretoria , where he lived .
Pistorius 's former girlfriends Melissa Rom and Samantha Taylor will also testify , along with medical experts , a weather forecaster , paramedics and ballistic and forensic experts .
The trial will be watched closely in Steenkamp 's home , Port Elizabeth .
Barbara Robertson , a fashion journalist and friend of the model , said : "" People are a bit cynical about Oscar Pistorius and sceptical of his fate .
Do we want revenge ?
What is justice ?
Whatever happened , he killed her and we do n't want him to walk away . """
2014-02-14,"Oscar Pistorius , the Paralympic athlete accused of murdering his girlfriend , broke his long public silence on Friday to describe her death as a "" devastating accident "" that "" consumes me with sorrow "" .
Both Pistorius and the family of Reeva Steenkamp spent the first anniversary of the Valentine 's Day shooting in quiet mourning and bracing for a murder trial just over two weeks away .
The 27-year - old admits shooting Steenkamp , a model , three times through a toilet door at his home in Pretoria , South Africa , but insists he mistook her for a burglar .
Before dawn on the anniversary , Pistorius tweeted for the first time in a year , posting "" a few words from my heart , "" and a link to his website .
A statement there said : "" No words can adequately capture my feelings about the devastating accident that has caused such heartache for everyone who truly loved – and continues to love Reeva .
He added : "" The pain and sadness – especially for Reeva 's parents , family and friends consumes me with sorrow .
The loss of Reeva and the complete trauma of that day , I will carry with me for the rest of my life – Oscar . ""
Known as "" Blade Runner "" because of his prosthetic legs , Pistorius has kept a low profile since being freed on bail last year : staying at his uncle 's home , resuming training and finding solace in religion .
He is due back in court on 3 March in a case that has attracted huge worldwide attention .
Enquiries into the mental state of the Paralympic champion , who also competed in the London 2012 Olympics , are dismissed by his family . ""
Asking this now is like asking a rally racer in the middle of a turn whether he 'd like an ice cream , "" his uncle , Arnold Pistorius , told South Africa 's Times . ""
At the moment it is focus .
Focus , focus , focus and then some more focus .
The sole thing we are focusing on now is the trial .
It is our end goal . ""
Steenkamp 's parents , Barry and June , are now running a pub outside Port Elizabeth and avoiding the media spotlight .
Their legal representative , Dup de Bruyn , said on Friday : "" The parents have no plans except to try and have a quiet day at home . ""
In a rare interview , they told the Times about the daily ordeal of living without their daughter , who was 29 when she died .
"" It is bad , "" June said .
"" Bad , bad , bad and nothing that is done will change that . ""
Under the circumstances we are not OK .
We are not all right .
Nothing will make us all right . ""
The couple have not been in court for Pistorius 's previous appearances but June confirmed she would be there for the trial , "" For me , for us and for Reeva –
but it will not bring our beautiful baby back .
It never gets easier .
In fact , it only gets worse . ""
Can you imagine how bad it is ?
Can you imagine waking up every morning knowing that you will never hear your daughter 's voice again , never see her smile , hear her laugh or hold her when she cries ? ""
Can you imagine someone just disappearing like that forever ?
Never saying goodbye .
Unless you have been there , you can never imagine it . ""
Other family members held their own commemoration .
The law graduate 's uncle , Mike Steenkamp , told AFP : "" We will release balloons in her memory .
They will be red and white , her favourite colours .
"" The function will be near Cape Town , "" away from the city and the concrete jungle "" , he said , adding that her parents and brother would not attend .
In two memorial adverts in the classified section of the Cape Times newspaper , family members paid tribute to "" our angel in heaven "" .
"" We miss you so very much but know that you are in the arms of our Lord , "" said relatives in Cape Town .
Family based in the UK said : "" We will never forget that tragic Valentine 's Day .
God came and picked his most beautiful flower to take to heaven . ""
On Friday the Women 's League of the ruling African National Congress marched in Pretoria to commemorate Steenkamp 's death , with many participants holding up posters denouncing violence against women .
"" Pistorius must rot in jail , "" one poster read .
The league said its march was intended to make communities aware of the "" barbaric conduct against women and children "" in the country ."
2014-02-14,"Oscar Pistorius , the Paralympic athlete accused of murdering his girlfriend , has broken his long public silence to describe her death as a "" devastating accident "" .
Pistorius issued a statement to mark the first anniversary of the Valentine 's day tragedy in which he shot Reeva Steenkamp three times through a toilet door at his home in Pretoria , South Africa .
He maintains that he believed her to be an intruder .
Just after 1 am local time on Friday , Pistorius tweeted for the first time in a year , linking to the statement on his website .

He is due to stand trial for murder on 3 March in a case that has attracted huge worldwide attention .
Steenkamp 's parents , Barry and June , also issued a statement this week through their lawyers .
"" All we are looking for is closure and to know that our daughter did not suffer on that tragic Valentine 's day , "" they said .
"" As the first anniversary of our beloved daughter 's death approaches , we would like to thank all family , friends , the people of South Africa , and the world for their compassion , kind words and comfort shown to us , and for the many letters of condolences we have received . ""
The family added that they intend to set up a foundation in honour of Steenkamp after the trial .
"" Reeva , who held such a passion for women 's abuse issues and frequently spoke out against domestic violence , intended to one day open an establishment where abused women would be cared for . ""
Steenkamp 's schoolfriend Gwyn Guscott posted on Facebook on Thursday : "" Tomorrow will be a tough one for most , but let 's remember how much she loved love and fill our day with roses and remember her stunning smile and that little giggle she used to do when she had happy thoughts .

2014-02-28,"The judge : Thokozile Masipa At the centre of the biggest media circus in South African legal history is a former crime reporter who was never short of stories during the dog days of the apartheid era .
Masipa , top , was also a social worker after leaving school in 1976 , and only completed her law degree at 43 .
In 1998 she became the second black woman on the Transvaal bench , and has spoken out strongly about violence against women in her judgments and twice handed down maximum sentences to men convicted of such crimes .
One was in 2009 against Freddy Mashamba , a police officer who shot and killed his former wife after a row over their divorce settlement . ""
No one is above the law , "" Masipa said .
"" You deserve to go to jail for life because you are not a protector .
You are a killer .
"" The second was in May against Shepherd Moyo , a serial rapist and burglar whose sentence of 252 years was intended to serve as a deterrent , she said .
"" The worst in my view is that he attacked and raped the victims in the sanctity of their own homes where they thought they were safe . ""
The prosecutor : Gerrie Nel Nel , middle , a career prosecutor with more than 30 years ' experience , has handled some of South Africa 's biggest cases and is unlikely to be disconcerted by the spotlight .
He has known worse .
In 2008 , when he was prosecuting Jackie Selebi , the country 's most senior police officer and later president of Interpol , Nel was arrested by 20 police officers in front of his wife and children in the early hours one morning .
Fraud charges against him were later dropped and , two years later , Nel secured a corruption conviction against Selebi , who was sentenced to 15 years behind bars .
"" Everything he touches turns to gold , "" Mthunzi Mhaga , a former national prosecuting authority spokesman , told South African media .
The defence : Barry Roux
In a case being compared to the OJ Simpson trial before it even opens , South Africa 's answer to the charismatic American defence lawyer Johnnie Cochran is Barry Roux , bottom , who will strive to prevent Pistorius from going to jail .
Roux was admitted to the Johannesburg bar in 1982 and is a senior advocate with a colourful history of clients .
â€
“ including Dave King , a Scottish - born businessman and former Rangers football club director who risked jail for ignoring the biggest tax bill in South African history .
It is speculated that Roux could be earning around 50,000 rand ( Â£3,600 ) a day .
He stole the limelight during Pistorius 's bail hearing when he tore into the evidence of the lead detective Hilton Botha . ""
This is like watching a baby seal getting clubbed , "" one South African journalist tweeted ."
2014-02-28,""" The Oscar Pistorius court case has all the elements of a Hollywood drama , "" says the blurb for South Africa 's flagship current affairs TV show this week .
""
A superstar sporting hero , a beautiful victim , a glamorous lifestyle and , on Valentine 's Day – a dramatic killing .
But this was n't fiction .
It was fact . ""
When Pistorius enters the North Gauteng high court on Monday morning , one of the most watched , most tweeted and most hyped murder trials in history will finally be under way .
South Africa , which had no television until 1975 , will launch a channel providing the kind of 24-hour rolling coverage usually associated with wars .
Dozens of journalists – from Le Monde in France to Yomiuri Shimbun in Japan – will be part of an international media extravaganza never before seen in an African court .
At the centre of it all will be a case that has everything but a whodunit , since the Paralympian has already admitted shooting dead his girlfriend , the model Reeva Steenkamp , at his home in the capital , Pretoria , on 14 February last year .
At issue is whether he intended to kill her , which could see him jailed for at least 25 years or , as he contends , mistook her for an intruder and fired four times in self - defence through a locked toilet door .
During the trial Pistorius , 27 , will call on at least four forensic scientists , and has hired a US forensic animation firm to digitally recreate the crime scene .
He is understood to be funding his own defence without input from his family .
But while the prosecution and defence trade blows in a case that could last months , another trial will be taking place simultaneously : that of South African criminal justice .
"" This far exceeds any other court cases in terms of hype and media attention , "" said Mandy Wiener , a journalist and author of Behind the Door :
The Oscar Pistorius and Reeva Steenkamp Story , one of several books about the case already in the pipeline .
"" It will certainly put the South African criminal justice system under the spotlight like no other case has done before . ""
Although there is no jury and the innocence or guilt of Pistorius – known as Blade Runner because of the prosthetics he uses to compete in athletics
– will be determined by Judge Thokozile Masipa with the help of two assessors , there are still fears that the OJ Simpson - style circus could jeopardise his chances of receiving a fair trial .
Pistorius 's defence raised such concerns this week when they argued for a broadcasting blackout in court .
Despite ruling that the trial could be covered live on radio , and parts of it on TV , Judge Dunstan Mlambo said he was aware of plans for round - the - clock TV coverage and warned : "" The so - called trial by media inclinations can not be in the interest of justice as required in this matter and have the potential to seriously undermine the court proceedings that will soon start . ""
Others share his concerns .
William Booth , a defence lawyer , said : "" The fact we have so much pre - publicity and commentary from experts means we will start pre - judging the case .
Many judges tell me that they read newspapers , watch TV and listen to the radio .
They have friends who ask them about cases .
I know my friends ask me about cases I 'm working on . ""
Although they have legal training and are supposed to be objective , judges are human and we have never had a situation like this before .
It 's crazy , hyped up media pressure
and I think the judge and the assessors could be influenced . ""
But media experts disagree .
Anton Harber , director of journalism and media studies at Wits University in Johannesburg , said : "" I think the danger of coverage threatening the fairness of the trial is easily exaggerated , especially without a jury .
It is speculative and unquantifiable , whereas the positive side of open justice is more real and tangible . ""
Pistorius will have the best legal minds defending him , a media team watching his back , and the justice system will be on its best behaviour , under the spotlight .
We all know that is not typical of our courts , so he is more fortunate than most accused .
"" There was evidence of Team Pistorius at work this week with the launch of a Twitter account , @OscarHardTruth , with the strapline "" Truth Shall Prevail .
Innocent until Proven Guilty "" .
By Thursday night it had more than 25,000 followers .
It is not only the frenzy of tweeting and punditry that will put South African justice under scrutiny .
One of the key questions to be tested in court is whether police tainted the crime scene at the start of their investigation .
During last year 's bail hearing , then lead detective Hilton Botha wilted under questioning , conceding that he had entered Pistorius 's home without the correct protective footwear , lost track of ammunition at the scene and made several false assumptions .
This comes against a backdrop of cases of incompetence , corruption and brutality among the South African police .
The case has also stirred commentary on two perennial South African themes .
Those who believe Pistorius is guilty point to the country 's high rate of domestic violence against women .
Those who think him innocent but trigger - happy highlight the fear of crime , often with a racial dimension , that drives some to live in guarded gated communities . ""
The man dubbed as the Blade Runner has articulated , to the point of triteness , the most popularly espoused white , middle - class South African paranoia , "" journalist Niren Tolsi wrote in the Mail and Guardian newspaper last year .
Yet attempts to grasp at wider meanings are likely to fall by the wayside on Monday when the theatricality of "" the trial of the century "" takes over .
Stepping into the dock in Pretoria , Pistorius will come face to face with Steenkamp 's mother , June , for the first time since the shooting .
Steenkamp 's father , Barry , reported to have had a major stroke , will not be in court .
Her uncle , Mike Steenkamp , said this week : "" They 're taking every day as it comes until the trial date .
It will be a form of closure , some stage of closure for them .
With the justice system it all depends on the case , and with this type of case the system should be working .
Let justice take its course . """
2014-03-02,"The family of Oscar Pistorius have called for an end to "" public commentary "" on his murder trial as he prepares for his biggest and most nerve - racking day in the world spotlight , dwarfing any of his star turns on the track .
Competition for gold , silver or bronze medals will be rendered trivial when the double - amputee athlete known as the blade runner enters court to a barrage of clicking cameras tomorrow .
Pistorius will stand trial for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp , 29 , at his luxury home in Pretoria , South Africa , on Valentine 's Day last year .
He claims her death was an accident .
Along with the intense legal tussle , Pistorius also faces the pressure of a trial in the court of public opinion , thanks to intense scrutiny by newspapers and live television and radio broadcasts of proceedings .
South Africa will even have a 24-hour TV channel devoted to coverage of , and commentary on , the trial .
Even if the Paralympic champion is found not guilty , his reputation will never be the same again as no stone in his personal life is left unturned .
A foretaste came on Saturday when Britain 's Sun newspaper reported that Pistorius , 27 , had a new girlfriend , Leah Skye , a 19-year - old student paramedic , labelled "" blade stunner "" by the paper .
A source close to the story told the Observer that the couple had in fact already separated ‚ coincidentally , on Valentine 's Day .
On Saturday his uncle , Arnold Pistorius , said : "" With less than two days before the start of Oscar 's criminal trial , the family as well as the legal team will not be distracted by extraneous issues that have no bearing on , or relevance to , the legal process that must now be allowed to unfold .
"" We will not be commenting on any media reports , nor will we be engaging the press on any issues that belong in court .
The time for public commentary is over .
The focus is now entirely on a very serious trial that is set to start this Monday .
We love Oscar , and believe in him , and will be standing by him throughout the coming trial .
"" The state has 107 witnesses for the trial , including Pistorius 's ex - girlfriends Melissa Rom and Samantha Taylor , whose mother welcomed the end of their relationship , posting on Facebook that she was grateful Taylor was no longer in Pistorius 's "" claws "" .
Erin Stear , who has denied reports she had an affair with Pistorius , will also take the stand .
In addition the court will hear from former footballer Mark Batchelor , who has claimed that Pistorius threatened to "" break my legs "" because he was a close friend of Steenkamp , a law graduate , model and reality TV star .
Prosecutors are expected to paint an unflattering portrait of the accused as reckless , hot - headed and obsessed with guns , every detail of which will be broadcast to the world and lapped up by pundits .
Sky News has shown footage of Pistorius at a firing range , shooting at a watermelon target that explodes on impact and draws delighted yells and laughter .
Police have said they found unlicensed .38 calibre ammunition in his house , while his Twitter account revealed he had boasted of going into "" full attack recon mode in the pantry "" after thinking an intruder was in his home .
The court will hear how , in one incident , Pistorius accidentally discharged a pistol under the table in a Johannesburg restaurant .
In another he put a bullet through the sunroof of a girlfriend 's car in a fit of rage .
Shortly after Steenkamp 's death , Nike had to scrap an advert that showed Pistorius bursting out of the starting blocks beneath the slogan : "" I am the bullet in the chamber . ""
On Monday he will face Steenkamp 's mother June for the first time .
She has already made her feelings clear in a TV interview last year , recalling an incident in which Steenkamp phoned her from Pistorius 's car .
"" She was afraid , "" June said .
"" She was so afraid .
She said , mummy , I 'm in the car with Oscar
and he 's driving like a lunatic .
Like a lunatic .
So I said , will you just give him the phone ?
She gave the phone to Oscar straight away .
And I said if you hurt my baby , I will have you wiped out . ""
Last month Pistorius reached an out - of - court settlement over an assault case in which he was accused of injuring a female guest at a party in his house .
In 2009 he crashed his speedboat into a pier , breaking his jaw and several ribs and damaging an eye socket .
When he came out of a three - day coma , he had 180 stitches in his face .
The prosecution is likely to state that Pistorius and Steenkamp argued on the night that he fired four rounds from a 9 mm pistol through a locked toilet door , hitting her in the head , arm and hip .
They will call on the testimony of neighbours who claim to have heard shouts and screams coming from the house .
Mobile phone records could also offer evidence of a fight .
Steenkamp is said to have had her phone with her in the toilet when she was shot ‚ unusual in the early hours of the morning .
Police have been trying to get access to Pistorius 's iPhone , which might contain evidence of a fight in the form of text messages .
South Africa 's Times newspaper recently reported that Pistorius was looking at pornography on the night of Steenkamp 's death .
Less than two years ago Pistorius graced the semi - final of the 400 m at the London Olympics , earning a bouquet of international sponsorship deals .
If the state succeeds in convincing judge Thokozile Masipa of intent to kill , the athlete will receive a life sentence with a minimum of 25 years in South Africa 's notoriously unforgiving prisons ."
2014-03-03,
2014-03-03,"The murder trial of Oscar Pistorius begins today as South Africa prepares for what is expected to be a marathon legal battle that throws a spotlight not just on the world - famous double - amputee athlete , but on his homeland 's criminal justice system and gun culture .
The trial , which has been compared to that of the OJ Simpson case in the United States 20 years ago , has led to the establishement in South Africa of a unique cable television channel dedicated to it .
The 24-hour channel , called The Oscar Pistorius Trial –
A Carte Blanche Channel , launched on Sunday night with footage of the sportsman 's girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , who was shot dead by him in the early hours of the morning on February 14 last year at his home .
While the Olymian denies murder and says that he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder , the prosecution maintains that he intentionally shot her several times after an argument .
State prosecutors are expected to paint an unflattering portrait of Pistorius as reckless , hot - headed and obsessed with guns , and have lined up 107 witnesses for the trial , including Pistorius 's ex - girlfriends Melissa Rom and Samantha Taylor , whose mother welcomed the end of their relationship .
Erin Stear , who has denied reports she had an affair with Pistorius , will also take the stand , as will the former footballer Mark Batchelor , who has claimed that Pistorius threatened to "" break my legs "" because he was a close friend of Steenkamp , a law graduate , model and reality TV star .
Police have said they found unlicensed .38-calibre
ammunition in Pistorius 's house , while his Twitter account revealed he had boasted of going into "" full attack recon mode in the pantry "" after thinking an intruder was in his home .
The court will hear how , in one incident , Pistorius accidentally discharged a pistol under the table in a Johannesburg restaurant .
He also put a bullet through the sunroof of a girlfriend 's car in a fit of rage .
Pistorius will also come face to face with Steenkamp 's mother , June , who made her feelings clear in a TV interview last year , recalling an incident in which Steenkamp phoned her from Pistorius 's car . ""
She was afraid , "" June said .
"" She was so afraid .
She said , ' Mummy , I 'm in the car with Oscar and he 's driving like a lunatic .
Like a lunatic . '
So I said , ' Will you just give him the phone ? '
She gave the phone to Oscar straight away .
And I said , ' If you hurt my baby , I will have you wiped out . '
"" Mobile phone records could be key during the trial , potentially indicating evidence of a fight .
Steenkamp is said to have had her phone with her in the toilet when she was shot .
Police have been trying to gain access to Pistorius 's iPhone , which might contain evidence of a fight in the form of text messages .
Another key piece of evidence , according to experts , may be the blood - spatter analysis of the inside of the toilet cubicle , which could give an indication of Steenkamp 's position when she was shot , including whether she was sitting on the toilet , or hiding behind the door , as prosecutors suspect .
Pistorius faces charges of murder , illegal possession of ammunition , and two additional counts relating to shooting a gun in public in two separate incidents before last year 's Valentine 's Day killing .
Criminal law experts believe that if the prosecution fails to prove premeditated murder , firing several shots through a closed door could bring a conviction for the lesser charge of culpable homicide , a South African equivalent of manslaughter covering unintentional deaths through negligence .
Sentences in such cases range from fines to prison .
They are left to courts to determine and are not set by fixed guidelines ."
2014-03-03,"And the Oscar goes to … the South African judicial system .
The judge for the murder trial of athlete Oscar Pistorius has decided to admit radio and television to his Pretoria court room today .
It should get an 18 certificate .
On trial is no great national issue , no terrorist gang or grand fraudster .
This is the examination of an intimate personal tragedy involving two people .
Yet television could boost it with "" all the elements of a Hollywood drama , a superstar sporting hero , a beautiful victim and a Valentine 's Day killing .
This was n't fiction .
This was fact , "" as one South African current affairs show put it .
The argument for holding trials in public is that justice should be seen to be done .
For all the ritual of judicial independence and court procedure , nothing can substitute for the ears and eyes of the world .
Hence open galleries , court reporting and public scrutiny .
And if court reporting why not court broadcasting ?
Surely the time has come for justice to enter the 21st century .
I am sure the combination of juries ( nowadays almost only in Britain and America ) and publicity given to celebrity cases , has removed the sober dignity that should be attached to a trial .
The hysteria that surrounded the televised OJ Simpson trial in 1995 showed the pressure that daily broadcasting could put on an entire court .
Justice does not demand infinite openness .
It does not get it with certain family and rape cases .
The clear light of day is not the same as the ruthless glare of the spotlight .
Most crimes are of no public importance .
As in Pistorius 's case , they arise from a moment of personal madness or cruelty , and are of concern to only a very few people .
Judgment is what is required , not a "" Hollywood blockbuster "" .
The only wider demand is that judgment be fair .
South Africa may feel it can gain by subjecting its judicial system to global scrutiny .
I doubt it will turn out that way ."
2014-03-03,
2014-03-03,"The cameras were rolling , the families were hushed and the A - list accused , Oscar Pistorius , had brought a cushion to the hard bench of the dock in the expansive wood - panelled courtroom .
South Africa 's eagerly awaited "" trial of the century "" was about to start – but one person was missing .
A court interpreter required to translate witness testimony had taken one look at the massed ranks of lawyers and photographers , and the melee of global news networks ' tents , satellite vans , and the camera drone hovering above the entrance , and had run away , quitting the case in an "" emotional "" state , officials said later .
It caused a 90-minute delay and was a measure of how this was a day , and a trial , unlike anything Africa has seen before .
A disabled sporting Icarus , a blond reality TV star and , on the first day alone , descriptions of "" bloodcurdling screams "" have been deemed worthy of a dedicated 24-hour TV channel in South Africa .
In some ways it is reminiscent of sensational murder trials that thrilled newspaper readers in Victorian Britain or jazz - age Chicago .
Only here the banks of reporters in the courthouse are not scribbling in notebooks but tweeting on laptops .
Pistorius alone , perhaps , is accustomed to the daunting glare after winning the admiration of millions in the Paralympics and Olympics as the "" blade runner "" on his prosthetic limbs .
On the biggest day of his life there was no sign of the broken , haunted figure who shook and sobbed uncontrollably in the dock at last year 's bail hearings .
Instead , the 27-year - old , wearing a dark suit , white shirt and black tie , looked composed and businesslike as he entered court D at the North Gauteng high court in Pretoria carrying a briefcase .
The court artist , a man with a pony - tail , gave him a sympathetic hug and elicited a smile .
Throughout the day Pistorius wrote copious longhand notes in an A4 pad , occasionally handing messages to his defence team .
Facing the mother of the woman he killed for the first time , he apparently never caught her eye .
When a replacement interpreter had been found and proceedings began at 11.30am , prosecutor Gerrie Nel read the charge that Pistorius unlawfully and intentionally did kill his girlfriend , the model Reeva Steenkamp .
Asked by the judge , Thokozile Masipa , how he pleaded , Pistorius rose and replied softly : "" Not guilty , my lady . ""
Judging that attack is the best form of defence , Pistorius 's lawyer read a statement that accused the prosecution of using inadmissible evidence to "" engineer an assassination of my character "" .
Pistorius insisted again that he had shot 29-year - old Steenkamp through the locked toilet door of his home believing she was an intruder .
"" What happened was a tragic accident , "" he said .
"" We were in a loving relationship .
There was no argument .
The allegation I wanted to shoot or kill Reeva could not be further from the truth . ""
Nel conceded there were no eyewitnesses to the murder and the state 's case is based on "" circumstantial evidence "" .
He called the first of 107 witnesses , university lecturer Michelle Burger , a neighbour whom , the court was told , lived 177 metres from Pistorius in their luxury gated community in Pretoria .
Speaking in the Afrikaans language , she told how she and her husband had been woken at about 3 am on Valentine 's day last year by screams .
"" I was still sitting in the bed and I heard her screams , "" she said .
"" She screamed terribly and she yelled for help .
Then I also heard a man screaming for help .
Three times he yelled for help .
Just after her screams , I heard four shots .
Four gunshots ...
bang bang , bang , bang .
"" It was very traumatic for me .
You could hear that it was bloodcurdling screams .
You ca n't translate it into words .
The anxiousness in her voice , and fear .
It leaves you cold to hear that angst , that fear . ""
She added : "" I heard petrified screaming before the gunshots , and just after the gunshots . ""
The evidence challenged Pistorius 's account because the athlete has said he thought Steenkamp was in bed , and did not describe any woman screaming .
It was the kind of moment for Barry Roux , Pistorius 's defence counsel , to step up and prove himself a worthy heir to Johnnie Cochran , the fierce and flamboyant lawyer who captivated the US in his defence of another sporting celebrity , OJ Simpson .
In the absence of a jury – there has been no jury system in South Africa since 1969
–
But Roux 's job was to make his case to Masipa , a former crime reporter presiding with two assessors , who was a mostly quiet and understated presence .
Roux memorably demolished the lead detective in the case during last year 's bail hearings .
But Burger was an altogether more formidable opponent .
It transpired that the replacement interpreter was not quite up to the job , so Burger switched her testimony to English , and seemed to grow in confidence over time .
"" I could n't understand why Mr Pistorius did n't hear the screams of the woman and if he did n't hear the screams of the woman that 's a question that needs to be asked to Mr Pistorius , "" the star witness said .
"" Because of the climax of her shouts , I knew something terrible was happening in that house .
You only shout like that if your life is really threatened . ""
Roux asked if it was possible Pistorius 's distressed voice might have sounded like a woman .
Burger insisted that she had heard two separate people , a man and a woman .
There were occasional glimpses of wider South African context .
Burger said she had assumed at the time she was overhearing a burglary .
Asked if it was possible that she had heard the sound of Pistorius smashing down the bathroom door and confused it with gunshots , Burger replied that she and most people in the courtroom could recognise gunshots .
Pistorius , who faces life in jail if convicted , showed little emotion as he watched and listened to the witness .
His family and that of Steenkamp sat on the same row in the crowded courtroom but did not interact .
Steenkamp 's mother , June , wearing black , stared at Pistorius coldly for long moments .
Members of the Pistorius family , however , were sufficiently relaxed to turn and chat with journalists sitting on the row behind , and relaxed at lunchtime in the canteen .
For the first time in South Africa , parts of a trial are being televised live , although Burger 's testimony was only relayed in audio .
Small CCTV - style cameras could be seen in corners of the courtroom .
Pistorius shared a hug with his brother , Carl , who earlier had tweeted "" You can only come to the morning through the shadows "" – words spoken by Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings .
Then Pistorius left the building and was driven away , hotly pursued by a chaotic rain - soaked crowd , and the first of many long nights of studio punditry began with barely disguised glee ."
2014-03-03,"•
A witness has told the trial of Oscar Pistorius that she heard “ bloodcurdling screams ” on the night the Paralympian shot his girlfriend dead .
•
The witness , Michelle Burger , told the court she heard two people - a man and a woman - shouting , adding : “ The fear in that woman ’s voice ; you only fear like that if your life is threatened .
”
•
Burger said she heard four gunshots on the night in question .
•
Pistorius has pleaded not guilty to the murder and to firearms charges , telling the court he denies the allegations of murder “ in the strongest terms ” and believed an intruder had broken into his house and was in his bathroom when he fired .
•
Pistorius says he approached the bathroom with a gun in an effort to protect Steenkamp and has accused the prosecution of once again using “ unsubstantiated allegations ” to argue that he murdered Steenkamp .
•
The Paralympian has also accused the prosecution of trying to use inadmissible evidence for the “ assassination of my character ” and said that suggestions he deliberately killed Steenkamp “ could not be further from the truth ” .
The court has adjourned until tomorrow morning .
Burger says media reports that Pistorius had shot Steenkamp after mistaking her for an intruder “ did not make sense ” given the fear she heard in Steenkamp ’s voice .
Burger says she knows what a gunshot sounds like and says she is “ 100 % sure I heard gunshots that evening
” .
Burger says she has no doubt that what she heard were four gunshots , but also says she has never heard the sound of a cricket bat striking a door .
Roux is now asking Burger whether what she heard may in fact have been the shouts of a desperate man - rather than those of a woman - and whether she may have heard a cricket bat being used to break down a door rather than gunshots ...
The court is now back in session and Roux is taking Burger through her witness statement .
There ’s to be a short adjournment while the two assessors are provided with copies of Michelle Burger ’s witness statement .
Roux is now questioning the accuracy and chronology of Burger ’s evidence ...
There ’s been some argument in court over the accuracy of the interpreting of Michelle Burger ’s testimony from Afrikaans to English , as David Smith notes ...
Burger says her testimony is hers and her husband
’s is his .
She says they have not changed their accounts of what happened .
She then adds , again , that she heard four gunshots .
The court is sitting again after adjourning for lunch .
The trial of Oscar Pistorius for the murder last year of his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , began in Pretoria this morning .
•
Pistorius has pleaded not guilty to the murder and to firearms charges , telling the court that he denies the allegations of murder “ in the strongest terms ” and he believed an intruder had broken into his house and was in the bathroom .
•
Pistorius says he approached the bathroom with a gun in an effort to protect Steenkamp , and he accused the prosecution of once again using “ unsubstantiated allegations ” to argue that he murdered Steenkamp .
•
The Paralympian also accused the prosecution of trying to use inadmissible evidence for the “ assassination of my character ” and said that suggestions he deliberately killed Steenkamp “ could not be further from the truth ” .
•
The first witness , a neighbour of Pistorius , has told the trial that she and her husband were woken on the night in question by “ blood - curdling ” screams and then heard four gunshots .
Here is a more detailed account of the morning ’s proceedings from the Press Association .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel told the court : They were the only two people in the house .
There were no eyewitnesses .
The state ’s case is based on circumstantial evidence .
He said evidence included what neighbours had heard , and prosecutors would argue that “ a certain inference ” could be drawn from the scene .
We argue that the accused ’s version in the bail application and today could not reasonably possibly be true ; should be rejected …
The only inference from the circumstantial evidence would be that the accused shot and killed the deceased .
The first witness , Michell Burger , who lived in the Silver Stream Estate , which neighbours Pistorius ’s Silverwoods Estate , described waking up at around 3 am to a woman ’s “ terrible screams ” .
Speaking through an interpreter , she said : We woke up from the screams .
My husband jumped up and went to the balcony .
I was still sitting in the bed and I heard her screams .
She said she also heard a man screaming for help , adding : “ Three times he yelled for help .
”
Burger said she called security and expected them to call security at the Silverwoods Estate .
She added : I heard her screams again , it was worse , it was more intense .
Just after her screams , I heard four shots , it was four gunshots that I heard .
The court is rising for an early lunch .
Burger says she and her husband realised how important their accounts were .
Not “ really being media people
”
, they contacted a lawyer about how the should go about making a statement .
Burger says she woke up the next morning thinking that their neighbours had suffered a break - in .
She did not realise what had taken place and asked a friend if she knew what had happened after the screams and gunshots .
When Burger went to the university she told a colleague about the previous night ’s events .
She started work and her husband called to ask if she could remember what had happened during the night .
Her husband told her that , according to the TV news , Pistorius had shot Steenkamp thinking she was an intruder .
She told her husband that that account did not fit with the noises they had heard .
Burger says her husband phoned security guards to tell them that their neighbours were being attacked .
Burger says she heard a woman ’s screams that were “ worse ; more intense ” .
She adds : “ It was a climax .
She was very scared .
”
Just after the screams , Burger heard four gunshots and says that there was a longer pause between the first and second gunshots than between subsequent shots .
Pistorius says he can not understand how the prosecution can allege that he and Steenkamp had argued before her death , nor its allegation that “ I shot her because of the argument
” .
Denies there was an argument .
Pistorius denies prosecution suggestions that he “ pursued ” Steenkamp to the bathroom .
Trial about to begin after 90-minute delay .
You ’ll probably have realised that the trial , which should have started at 8 am UK time , has yet to begin .
According to AP , the judge has not arrived but proceedings should begin shortly .
And finally , the defence counsel , Barry Roux :
In a case being compared to the OJ Simpson trial before it even opens , South Africa ’s answer to the charismatic American defence lawyer Johnnie Cochran is Barry Roux , who will strive to prevent Pistorius from going to jail .
Roux was admitted to the Johannesburg bar in 1982 and is a senior advocate with a colourful history of clients , including Dave King , a Scottish - born businessman and former Rangers football club director who risked jail for ignoring the biggest tax bill in South African history .
It is speculated that Roux could be earning around 50,000 rand ( £ 3,600 ) a day .
He stole the limelight during Pistorius ’s bail hearing when he tore into the evidence of the lead detective , Hilton Botha .
“
This is like watching a baby seal getting clubbed , ” one South African journalist tweeted .
And now the prosecutor , Gerrie Nel : A career prosecutor with more than 30 years’ experience , Nel has handled some of South Africa‘s biggest cases and is unlikely to be disconcerted by the spotlight .
He has known worse .
In 2008 , when he was prosecuting Jackie Selebi , the country ’s most senior police officer and later president of Interpol , Nel was arrested by 20 police officers in front of his wife and children in the early hours one morning .
Fraud charges against him were later dropped and , two years later , Nel secured a corruption conviction against Selebi , who was sentenced to 15 years behind bars .
“
Everything he touches turns to gold , ” Mthunzi Mhaga , a former national prosecuting authority spokesman , told South African media .
While we wait for proceedings to begin , let ’s have a look at the key players in the trial , starting with the judge :
At the centre of the biggest media circus in South African legal history is Thokozile Masipa , a former crime reporter who was never short of stories during the dog days of the apartheid era .
Masipa became a social worker after leaving school in 1976 , and only completed her law degree at 43 .
In 1998 she became the second black woman on the Transvaal bench , and has spoken out strongly about violence against women in her judgments and twice handed down maximum sentences to men convicted of such crimes .
One was in 2009 against Freddy Mashamba , a police officer who shot and killed his former wife after a row over their divorce settlement .
“
No one is above the law , ” Masipa said .
“
You deserve to go to jail for life because you are not a protector .
You are a killer .
”
The second was in May 2013 against Shepherd Moyo , a serial rapist and burglar whose sentence of 252 years was intended to serve as a deterrent , she said .
“
The worst [ thing ] in my view is that he attacked and raped the victims in the sanctity of their own homes where they thought they were safe .
”
Here ’s a bit more detail and background from the Press Association .
Pistorius , wearing a dark suit , white shirt and dark tie , was ambushed by cameras as he made his way through the building to the courtroom .
Crowds of media gathered outside the court for the case , which has attracted global attention .
The trial is expected to hear from more than 100 witnesses , including neighbours who claim to have heard screams from his house that night , as well as former girlfriends of the athlete .
Parts of the proceedings will be broadcast live , and in South Africa a 24-hour channel will cover the trial and commentary around it .
Today is thought to be the first time Pistorius will come face to face with Steenkamp ’s mother , June , who is attending the trial .
The sporting star ’s case will be decided by a judge assisted by two “ assessors ” , but no jury .
The mandatory sentence for someone convicted of premeditated murder in South Africa is life with a minimum of 25 years in prison , meaning if Pistorius is found guilty he will be over 50 when he is released .
The paralympian is accused of the premeditated murder of Steenkamp , who died of multiple gunshot wounds .
Prosecutors allege Pistorius shot her four times through the locked bathroom door at his home in Pretoria in the early hours of 14 February 2013 .
Some witnesses have described hearing a woman scream , followed by “ moments of silence ” , then hearing gunshots followed by more screaming .
Pistorius claims he thought an intruder was in his home , but prosecutors say that even so , an “ error in persona ” did not affect the fact he intended to kill someone .
Some 107 witnesses are listed by the state , including Steenkamp ’s close friends Desiree , Gina and Kim Myers , as well as Pistorius ’s sister Aimee and his uncle Arnold .

Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the trial of Oscar Pistorius , who is accused of murdering his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , on Valentine ’s Day last year .
The Guardian ’s Africa correspondent , David Smith , is in court .
South Africa is preparing for what is expected to be a marathon legal battle that throws a spotlight not just on the world - famous double - amputee athlete , but on his homeland ’s criminal justice system and gun culture .
The trial , which has been compared to that of the OJ Simpson case in the United States 20 years ago , has led to the establishment in South Africa of a unique cable television channel dedicated to it .
The 24-hour channel , called The Oscar Pistorius Trial –
A Carte Blanche Channel , launched on Sunday night with footage of the sportsman ’s girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , who was shot dead by him in the early hours of the morning on February 14 last year at his home .
While the Olympian denies murder and says that he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder , the prosecution maintains that he intentionally shot her several times after an argument ."
2014-03-03,"Now is not a good time to be a Pistorian .
The trial of Oscar Pistorius – for the fatal shooting of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in February last year – must have made many fans of the athlete question their allegiances .
But for others the trial is less a challenge to their support , than a showcase for it .
Not everyone likes the term "" Pistorian "" though .
Lindy Steenveld , 34 , from Vredenburg , South Africa , is happy to describe herself as one .
But Mira Teuber , 39 , who lives in north Germany and runs a Support for Oscar blog , dislikes the term 's "" negative connotations "" .
"" We want to be referred to as ' supporters ' who are loyal and compassionate for everyone affected by this tragedy . ""
Since Pistorius 's arrest , a number of fan sites and Facebook support groups have sprung up .
Under the banner "" We 'll Stand By You "" , fans post messages such as "" Praying for you Oscar "" and "" Think before you judge "" .
So what is it about Pistorius that inspires such devotion ?
Why do some fans want to pledge support for an idol who is on a murder charge , with an absolute belief in his innocence ? ""
Probably too much time on their hands , "" says Michael Berry , a clinical forensic psychologist at the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland .
But Steenveld , 34 , has a job , a partner and a four - year - old son , while Mira Teuber , 39 , has a day job as a business administration clerk .
Another supporter , Sharon Horswill , from Birmingham , ca n't talk because she 's "" tied up in meetings ( deliberately arranged
so I would n't be following every moment of the trial ) "" .
There must be better explanations .
"" The whole process can be quite exciting , "" says Berry .
"" Organising what you 're doing , where you 're going .
Fans meet each other , get to know each other . ""
Building a network on social media creates an infrastructure that encourages support .
And the story of someone overcoming physical and emotional hardship in order to win on a global stage is a compelling one .
"" People have invested a lot in Pistorius .
He was the star of South Africa .
He is good looking , a multimillionaire who did charity work .
His is the kind of image that parents would want their kids to grow up with .
People have to protect that because if they do n't the whole image starts to disintegrate . ""
Steenveld , who will watch the trial on TV until she falls asleep at night , gives her explanation quietly , in a voice that sounds like a shrug .
She says simply that Pistorius "" is someone special .
He has a special place in my heart , although he does n't know who I am .
He is a South African hero .
He reached for things and he achieved them . ""
Her four - year - old son will be seeing a lot of "" Oscar "" – she has never met him but prefers to use his first name – in the coming weeks .
She plans to tell him more about the athletics than the "" accident "" though .
Both Steenveld and Teuber believe Pistorius is innocent of murder .
"" I believe that what he stated in his affidavit is the truth , "" says Teuber .
It is easy to mock such conviction , but belief is not the same as delusion .
If he is found guilty , Steenveld says he should be punished as anyone would be – "" even though it would break my heart to see him go to jail "" ."
2014-03-03,"A neighbour of Oscar Pistorius heard "" bloodcurdling screams "" coming from his home on the night he shot dead his girlfriend , a court has heard told as his eagerly awaited murder trial opened .
The Paralympic athlete pleaded not guilty to the murder of the model Reeva Steenkamp as the case got under way at the North Gauteng high court in Pretoria , the capital of South Africa .
In a statement read out by his lawyer , Pistorius described the 29-year - old 's death as a tragic accident , saying he had mistaken her for an intruder and did not intend to kill her . ""
This allegation is denied in the strongest terms , "" he added .
"" We were in a loving relationship . ""
But the first day – which started late owing to a missing interpreter – was dominated by a star witness for the prosecution , Dr Michelle Burger , a university lecturer .
She said she and her husband had been woken at around 3 am on Valentine 's day last year by screams coming from Pistorius 's home , in a gated community , 580 feet ( 177 metres ) away from her own home .
"" It was very traumatic , "" Burger said .
"" You could hear it was bloodcurdling screams .
You ca n't translate it into words .
The anxiousness in her voice , and fear .
It leaves you cold . ""
She screamed terribly and she yelled for help .
It was something you ca n't explain to someone else , how anxious those screams were . ""
Just after her screams , I heard shots , four shots , "" she said , describing one clear shot then three clustered together : "" bang … bang , bang , bang "" .
Refusing to buckle under pressure from the defence lawyer .
Barry Roux , Burger added : "" I heard petrified screaming before the gunshots and just after the gunshots .
"" I could n't understand why Mr Pistorius did n't hear the screams of the woman .
And if he did n't hear the screams of the woman , that 's a question that needs to be asked to Mr Pistorius .
"" She testified that she had also heard a man shout for help three times before the shots were fired .
At the time , she assumed the man and woman were being attacked by burglars . ""
Because of the climax of her shouts , I knew something terrible was happening in that house .
You only shout like that if your life is really threatened . ""
Wearing a dark suit , a white shirt and a black tie , Pistorius , 27 , carried a black briefcase , and looked more composed and businesslike than at last year 's bail hearings .
He sat on a cushion in the dock and made copious notes in an A4 pad .
He did not make eye contact with Steenkamp 's stony - faced mother , June .
The Pistorius and Steenkamp families sat on the same row in the packed courtroom .
Behind them were journalists from around the world , gathered for what has been called South Africa 's "" trial of the century "" .
A single judge , Thokozile Masipa , is presiding over the trial , along with two assessors .
For the first time in South Africa , parts of the trial are being televised live , although Burger 's testimony was relayed only in audio .
Proceedings were adjourned until 9.30am local time on Tuesday ."
2014-03-04,"On the second day of the Pistorius trial : â€¢ Charl Johnson , a neighbour of the athlete , told the court he heard screams and four consecutive shots on the night in question .
He said he had assumed that neighbours were being robbed , and had been surprised to learn the next day that Pistorius had shot Reeva Steenkamp .
â€¢ Johnson said that after realising how close their house was to the crime scene , he and his wife had chosen to speak to a lawyer rather than the police as they wanted to keep out of the public eye .
â€¢ Another witness , Johnsonâ€ ™ s wife , Michelle Burger , again insisted that she heard the screams of a woman , rather than an anguished man , on the night of Steenkampâ€ ™ s death .
â€¢ Burger rejected defence claims that the loud noises she heard coming from Pistoriusâ€ ™ s house were the sound of him using a cricket bat to smash down the door of the bathroom .
She said she heard four loud gunshots , and that the intervals between each were too short for the noises to have been a bat swung against a wooden door .
â€¢ Burger disputed claims that she used her husbandâ€ ™ s witness statement as a template for her own - and denied basing her evidence on â€œretrospective knowledgeâ€ � gleaned from later media coverage .
â€¢
The defence also sought to question Burgerâ€ ™ s evidence by arguing that Steenkamp would have been too severely injured by gunshots to have been able to scream .
â€¢
Another neighbour ,
Estelle van der Merwe , told the court she woke to hear an argument and four noises - which could have been consecutive gunshots - on the night Steenkamp died .
â€¢
The judge has reminded the media not to publish any images of witnesses after a TV channel and several papers carried a still photograph of one witness .
The judge agrees to Nelâ€ ™ s request that the case be adjourned for the day , reminds Johnson that he is still under oath , and rises .
The court will sit again tomorrow at 9.30am
( 7.30am UK time ) .
Johnson said he realised that he and his wife had been far closer to the crime scene than other witnesses , but decided to contact a lawyer rather than go straight to the police as they wanted to keep out of the public eye .
Johnson said he was surprised to be told that Pistorius had shot his girlfriend as he had assumed he had heard a break - in the previous night .
He said he found it hard to square that account with what he had witnessed , as he had heard both a man and a woman calling for help , and assumed they were reacting to an armed burglary and not having a domestic dispute .
Johnson says he heard shots and later found out there had been a total of four .
Asked about the timings of the shots , he says : â€œThere was a small pause after the first shot and the remaining shots were fired in close succession.â€ �
He and his wife were shocked , and she told him she feared the man whose voice they had heard had been shot dead in front of his wife .
Johnson says he could hear the voice of a woman â€œ[who ] was in trouble .
It was clearly distressed callsâ€ � .
Then he heard a man call , â€œHelp !
Help!â€ � .
He rang estate security on his wifeâ€ ™ s phone and told them that people were being attacked in the neighbouring estate .
It turned out that the number in her phone was for the security office for the estate where they used to live .
He told them he had got the wrong number and went back to the balcony .
Van der Merwe has finished her evidence .
The next witness is Charl Johnson , husband of the first witness , Michelle Burger , who comes back into court to watch .
Weâ€ ™ re back to the question of whether it was a manâ€ ™ s voice or womanâ€ ™ s voice that was heard that night .
Van der Merwe says it was a womanâ€ ™ s .
Van der Merwe says she knows a womanâ€ ™ s voice when she hears it - especially if that woman is angry .
Proceedings have resumed .
Hereâ€ ™ s a video of Roux questioning Pistoriusâ€ ™ s
former neighbour Michelle Burger
On the second day of the Pistorius trial : â€¢ Michelle Burger , a neighbour of the athlete , has again insisted that she heard the screams of a woman , rather than an anguished man , on the night of Steenkampâ€ ™ s death .
â€¢ Burger has rejected defence claims that the loud noises she heard coming from Pistoriusâ€ ™ s house were the sound of him using a cricket bat to smash down the door of the bathroom .
She says she heard four loud gunshots , and that the intervals between each were too short for the noises to have been a bat swung against a wooden door .
â€¢ Burger has disputed claims that she used her husbandâ€ ™ s witness statement as a template for her own - and denied basing her evidence on â€œretrospective knowledgeâ€ � gleaned from later media coverage .
â€¢
The defence has sought to question Burgerâ€ ™ s evidence by arguing that Steenkamp would have been too severely injured to have been able to scream after being shot .
â€¢
Another neighbour , Estelle van der Merwe , has told the court she woke to hear an argument and four noises - which could have been consecutive gunshots - on the night Steenkamp died .
â€¢
The judge has reminded the media not to publish any images of witnesses after a TV channel and several papers carried a still photograph of one witness .
The court has risen for an early lunch .
Nel will resume his questioning of Van der Merwe this afternoon .
On hearing the â€œshotsâ€ � , Van der Merwe turned her husband , who told her that the noises were gunshots .
He looked out of the window , but could see nothing .
They went back to bed and her husband called security .
Shortly after , she heard someone â€œcrying out loudâ€ � .
Van der Merwe says the four â€œshotsâ€ � were consecutive .
Van der Merwe says she , her husband and son went to bed around nine .
She says he woke up at 1.56am to hear people talking in loud voices , as if fighting .
It lasted about an hour
but she could not hear what they said , nor determine what language they were speaking .
She says she was annoyed by the disturbance as her son had an exam the next day .
She put a pillow over her head to block out the noise and tried to go back to sleep .
Later , she tried to see what she could see , but , failing to make out anything , went back to sleep .
She says she was woken around 3 am by four â€œnoisesâ€ � .
Interpreter translates â€œnoisesâ€ � as gunshots but , once again , the lawyers step in to question the accuracy of the interpreting .
Judge tells Burger she may leave the witness box and thanks her for her evidence .
Nel now re - examining Burger and asks if the sequence of shots ( one shot , a long pause and then three more shots , far closer together ) could have fitted with a cricket bat being used to smash a door .
Burger says she thinks too much time would have elapsed between cricket bat blows for a bat to have made the noises she heard .
Roux has wrapped up his cross - examination by questioning whether Burger is able to recognise the sound of a gunshot as she has not heard a gun fired for some year .
Burger says , once again , that gunshots make far more noise than a cricket bat would on a wooden door .
Burger insists she heard a woman scream following , or overlapping with , the last of four shots .
Roux replies that the medical evidence shows that Steenkamp could not have screamed after being shot as she would have lost â€œcognitive functionâ€ � .
Nel objects to Rouxâ€
™ s
use of the ballistic evidence and suggests that his opponentâ€ ™ s cross - examination is again relying on selective quotation .
Roux is now sketching out Pistoriusâ€ ™ s attempts to smash the bathroom door with a cricket bat : â€œIt was a stage of heightened anxiety ; it was a pinnacle
â€
¦
It was him screaming ,
absolutely anxious.â€
�
Roux suggests what Burger heard were not Steenkampâ€ ™ s screams , but the cries of his deeply upset client .
He also says that ballistic evidence shows that Steenkamp would by then have been too seriously wounded by the gunshot to her head to have screamed out .
Again , Burger suggests that Roux would be better off asking Pistorius these questions .
Roux asks Burger to be objective .
If a man is about to shoot his girlfriend who is hiding in a bathroom , is it not â€œinconsistentâ€ � that he would shout for help , he asks ?
Burger replies that the manâ€ ™ s cries were â€œpart of the sequenceâ€ � of the events of that night .
Roux has returned to yesterdayâ€ ™ s questions about how Burger could have told the difference between a gunshot and the sound of a cricket back struck against a wooden bathroom door , and between a female voice and an anguished male voice .
Burger on the similarities between the statements :
My lady , thatâ€ ™ s what I heard and Iâ€ ™ m glad that my husband heard exactly the same .
She again denies using her husbandâ€ ™ s testimony as the basis of her own .
Roux is reprimanded by the judge - and apologises - after replying , sarcastically , that
â€œof
courseâ€ �
Burger hadnâ€
™ t read her husbandâ€ ™ s statement .
Roux says the similarities between the two statements are â€œstrikingâ€ � .
Burger says itâ€ ™ s because they both follow the same sequence of events , as elicited by police questioning .
â€œI answered on the questions asked , â€ � she says , adding that they were both asked the same questions by the investigating officer .
Burger denies using her husbandâ€ ™ s statement as a template for her own .
Laughter erupts in court after Burger tells Roux her statement describing the open windows of her bedroom that night was very similar to her husbandâ€ ™ s description â€œbecause we were in the same bedroomâ€ � .
Roux says he will go through the statements , side - by - side , to highlight the similarities .
â€œItâ€ ™ s as if the one were used predominantly as a template for the other , â€ � he says .
Proceedings have resumed .
The judge and two assessors are being handed copies of Michelle Burgerâ€ ™ s husbandâ€ ™ s witness statement , which , says Roux , is â€œremarkably similar â€ ¦ too similarâ€ � to her own .
The court has now adjourned for a short break .
Roux asks how , from a distance of 177 m , Burger could have heard emotional screams and shouts from a locked , enclosed bathroom .
He invites the court to visit the crime scene and judge for themselves how hard it would be to hear noises from Pistoriusâ€ ™ s bathroom from Burgerâ€ ™ s house .
He says itâ€ ™ s impossible ; Burger points out a lot of construction has taken place since the killing of Steenkamp , making it harder to hear noise from neighbouring properties .
Burger says she could hear the noises from Pistoriusâ€ ™ s house as they are no buildings between her house and his .
She adds that she had her bedroom windows open and did not have a fan on .
Burger is being asked by Roux to explain why she thought there was an intruder in Pistoriusâ€ ™ s house that night .
Roux is suggesting she is using knowledge gleaned from media coverage after the event as part of her testimony .
She denies it .
â€œI did not change or alter
[ it].â€ � Roux has resumed his cross - examination .
The judge has now warned the media to be careful and to heed the orders in place .
Gerrie Nel has called for an investigation into how the picture came to be used .
eNCA , the news channel broadcasting the trial , has denied breaching the order by showing footage of a witness .
According to its Twitter account , it has used a still picture of Burger from the website of the university where she works .
The trial has been adjourned as the prosecutor has just informed the judge that an order prohibiting the broadcast of a witnessâ€ ™ s face appears to have been broken .
( As you can see from the top of the blog , proceedings are being broadcast live . )
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s counsel , Barry Roux , is continuing his cross - examination of Michelle Burger , who lived 177 m from the athleteâ€ ™ s house , and who told the court yesterday that she heard a womanâ€ ™ s â€œbloodcurdlingâ€ � screams and â€œpetrified shoutsâ€ � , followed by four shots on the night Steenkamp died .
Thereâ€ ™ s some fascinating social context in Margie
Orfordâ€ ™ s piece over on the Guardian Africa Network here .
In it , the journalist and author probes the â€œparanoid imaginings of suburban South Africaâ€ � .
Hereâ€ ™ s a bit of it : The murder trial of Oscar Pistorius is gearing up to be a John Grisham - style courtroom drama .
It will be a battle of â€˜expertâ€ ™ opinions because the uncontested fact is that on Valentineâ€ ™ s Day last year Pistorius fired four shots at close range through a locked bathroom door and killed Reeva Steenkamp .
This is not in dispute .
What is in dispute is his claim that he did not intend to kill his girlfriend .
He says he was shooting at somebody else ; that he thought there was an â€˜intruderâ€ ™ in the bathroom ; that this killing was a mistake ; that it was not just another South African femicide .
So the trial will revolve around Pistoriusâ€ ™ intention : essentially , the psychology of a man who claims to have been driven by fear to shoot before asking any questions .
This claim inserts a third body into an all too familiar narrative of domestic violence .
This imaginary body of the paranoid imaginings of suburban South Africa has lurked like a bogeyman at the periphery of this story for the past year .
It is the threatening body , nameless and faceless , of an armed and dangerous black intruder ...
Here are yesterdayâ€ ™ s key events : Summary â€¢ A witness told the trial that she heard â€œbloodcurdling screamsâ€ � on the night the Paralympian shot his girlfriend dead .
â€¢ The witness , Michelle Burger , told the court she heard two people - a man and a woman - shouting , adding : â€œThe fear in that womanâ€ ™ s voice ; you only fear like that if your life is threatened.â€
�
â€¢ Burger said she heard four gunshots on the night in question .
â€¢ Pistorius pleaded not guilty to the murder and to firearms charges , telling the court he denied the allegations of murder â€œin the strongest termsâ€ � and believed an intruder had broken into his house and was in his bathroom when he fired .
â€¢ Pistorius said he approached the bathroom with a gun in an effort to protect Steenkamp and accused the prosecution of once again using â€œunsubstantiated allegationsâ€ � to argue that he murdered Steenkamp .
â€¢
The Paralympian also accused the prosecution of trying to use inadmissible evidence for the â€œassassination of my characterâ€ � and said that suggestions he deliberately killed Steenkamp â€œcould not be further from the truthâ€ � .
Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the second day of the trial of Oscar Pistorius , who is accused of murdering his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , on 14 February last year .
Once again , our Africa correspondent , David Smith , will be in court D at the North Gauteng high court in Pretoria .
You can follow his tweets here .
You can read his report of the first dayâ€ ™ s events here ."
2014-03-04,"The trial of Oscar Pistorius , who denies the murder of his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , is – according to the Independent – "" the most eagerly awaited trial in South African legal history "" .
That ca n't be right , can it ?
This is a nation that saw Nelson Mandela prepared to die for "" the ideal of a democratic and free society "" in the Rivonia trial .
This is a country in which the rule of law and the demands of power stood for years in brutal contradiction .
Can this killing , intentional or not , ever hold so much meaning ?
On the one hand , no – it 's the hyperbole required by the intensity of the glare , the same impulse that drives reporters across the world to describe the moment when Pistorius holds his head in his hands , that propels the BBC to tell us what colour highlighter the man is using .
In the circular logic of the media circus , the fact of its global reach means it must have global importance .
Anyone questioning that would have to exercise some restraint .
Celebrity trials bring a looting mentality .
There 's a breakdown of norms , a sense that decency is pointless – if you do n't report it , someone else will .
It 's understandable – the private life of the accused , usually so prized , so closely defended behind its PR ramparts , is cast into open court for anyone to see .
Who would n't grab all they could ?
But that does n't give it significance ; we 'll wake up from this as we would from any other riot , with a hangover and some canned goods that we ca n't remember wanting .
And yet , of course , there is meaning in this trial : misogyny is on trial ; violence against women is on trial ; guns are on trial .
Drawing a comparison with the killing of Trayvon Martin , the Nation journalist Dave Zirin makes a subtle , thought - provoking point about gated communities themselves , the way they have "" become throbbing pods of paranoia and parabellums "" ; in which reading , even if this is judged accidental , inequality itself is on trial .
South African justice has a case to answer here , with its 14 % conviction rate for rapists ; but it 's not as though the UK or America have anything to crow about in that regard .
The wider culture of South Africa is on trial as a nidus of violence against women , a country with the highest recorded incidence of rape in the world , in which three women a day are killed by their partners .
But the more we turn these figures over , the more global they are , restricted neither to rich countries nor poor ones .
Often the only discernible difference between one country and another is not in women 's experiences but in the reliability of the statistical collection that illustrates them .
Unavoidably , if we see this case as synecdoche for the way justice fails women in that country , we have to ask how well are women served by justice here ?
If we watch this trial making any connection between Steenkamp 's death and the demonstration that occurred two days before it outside South Africa 's parliament , protesting at the pathetic punishments of men who kill women , we have to make that connection between the death of women everywhere and the global indolence that meets the prosecution of their killers .
Here the case does have significance to warrant its exposure ; it opens up a chasm between those who look at this case and see a misogyny that is global and systemic , and those who not only reject that but openly laugh at it , trivialising a woman 's death just to attack the audacity of those who insist upon its seriousness .
The most obvious example , of course , is Paddy Power , the bookies who were offering a bet on his innocence ( explained here ) with the promise of your money back if Pistorius "" walked "" .
A suggestion hovers over the wording , that it sets out to mock the defendant 's prosthetic legs ; but of course there is no mistaking the main intent , which is to treat this death as a piece of fun .
Would they do it if a child had died ?
What if a man had ?
There is something disgusting in how easily those questions are answered .
The journalist Giles Coren tweeted something in the same mould : "" The lawyers and witnesses in the Pistorius case are SO good at funny accents – but is it respectful ? ""
The "" joke "" ( "" I think foreigners are funny "" ) is supposed to scene - set this as an anti - PC jape .
Come on , be reasonable – if foreigners can accept that they 're inherently funny , why ca n't women too ?
Why are the one billion always rising ?
Why ca n't they just pipe down ?
Those provocations , deliberately conceived as antics , do n't depress me as much as the casual objectification in the tabloids : Steenkamp a collection of body parts ( mainly "" leggy "" ) ; Pistorius the embodiment of heroism ( indeed , in a bizarre description of his bearing by the Washington Post at his bail hearing , "" inspirational "" ) .
Taken together , this goes a long way towards explaining how such cases become so totemic ; the status quo is n't a compromise between those who see misogyny everywhere and those who refuse to see it .
It 's a ceasefire born of depletion ; we 're all just waiting for fresh ammo .
Yet , just because the Pistorius trial started , or restarted , this battle , does n't mean it can finish it .
When OJ Simpson was on trial , different divisions opened up : it became a conduit for a conversation about race – could a black man ever be found not guilty ?
– and simultaneously one about wealth and access to justice –
could a rich man ever be convicted ?
Even if those questions were n't a zero - sum game , the trial – one life , one death – could never have been big enough to answer them .
These crucible trials end but never resolve .

2014-03-04,"Oscar Pistorius broke down and wept as a court heard for the first time the sequence of fatal injuries suffered by his girlfriend when he shot her repeatedly at his home .
The Paralympic athlete was in the dock for the second day of a murder trial in Pretoria , South Africa , that is being followed by millions around the world .
He claims he fired four times through a locked bathroom door in February last year because he mistook Reeva Steenkamp for an intruder .
Gerrie Nel , prosecuting , told the court that a ballistics report showed the first bullet hit the 29-year - old in the right thigh , the second missed her and hit a wall , the third caught her shoulder and the fourth struck her in the head , killing her .
The details emerged as the defence counsel , Barry Roux , challenged a neighbour 's witness testimony that she had heard a woman scream just after the final shot .
"" There was serious , serious brain damage , and our evidence will be that a person with that brain damage will have no response , no cognitive function , no thought process , "" he said .
"" It can not be .
She could not have screamed . ""
An expert will later testify in the trial that "" with the head shot , she would have dropped down immediately , "" Roux added .
On hearing the graphic account , Pistorius , 27 , who had been self - controlled in the trial so far , bowed his head and folded his hands behind his neck , then wiped away tears with a white handkerchief .
Across the court , one of Steenkamp 's relatives touched a photo of the model and law graduate , who was 29 when she died , as a man put his arm around her .
Day two of the "" blockbuster trial "" was emotionally charged as a star witness for the prosecution also lost her composure and wept .
Michelle Burger , who claims to have heard "" bloodcurdling screams "" coming from Pistorius 's house , had just undergone a fierce cross - examination from Roux ( South Africa 's 24-hour trial TV channel asked viewers if Roux was "" too hard "" on Burger : 54 % said yes , 46 % said no . )
But it was the gentler questioning of Nel that finally moved the university lecturer to tears .
He asked Burger about her emotions at the time when she made her statement to police . ""
It was quite raw , "" she said , her voice breaking .
"" When I 'm in the shower , I relive her shouts , "" Burger , who lives 177 metres from Pistorius 's house , said of hearing screaming before , during and immediately after the sound of gunshots .
Nel asked her how she was coping .
"" I 'm coping fine .
It 's been a year . ""
The state then called its second witness , Estelle van der Merwe , who lives less than 100 metres from Pistorius 's luxury home in a gated community .
"" I woke up in the morning at 1.56am to sounds of someone talking loudly and fighting , "" she told the court through an Afrikaans language interpreter .
"" It lasted about an hour .
From where I was sitting it seemed like two people were having an argument
but I could n't hear the other person 's voice . ""
Later she recalled waking up to the sound of loud bangs .
But Roux put it to her : "" The fact is you did not hear an argument .
You heard a woman 's voice .
You could not hear the language or words spoken . ""
During the cross - examination it also emerged that the defence team went to Pistorius 's home in February this year and arranged for a man and woman to scream at the top of their voices at 2 - 3am to test how far the sound would travel .
Finally Burger 's softly spoken husband , Charl Johnson , also took the stand , telling the judge , Thokozile Masipa , that a woman 's screams woke him up and that he ran to his balcony . ""
At that point the fear and intensity of her voice escalated and it was clear that this person 's life was in danger , "" he said .
"" That 's when the first shots were fired . ""
Both Johnson and Burger also said they heard a man shout for help , a point that was seized upon by the defence as evidence that Pistorius was calling for help .
The trial is making South African legal history because it is being broadcast live .
But on Tuesday Nel accused the eNews Channel Africa of a "" clear violation "" of a court ruling by airing Burger 's photograph .
The channel said it got the picture from an independent source and pointed out it was also published in newspapers .
Judge Masipa called for an investigation and said : "" I am warning the media , if you do not behave , you are not going to be treated with soft gloves by this court . ""
Meanwhile Steenkamp 's mother , June , has told of her disappointment after Pistorius walked past her in court on Monday without acknowledging her presence .
June , 67 , had never met the "" blade runner "" before but travelled from her home in a hamlet near Port Elizabeth , Eastern Cape province , to attend court in the hope of looking him in the eye .
"" I wanted to see him and him to see me , "" she told ITV News . ""
But he did n't look at me or anything .
He just walked straight and looked ahead . ""
She looked sombre at the trial and stared at Pistorius for long moments when he entered , but he appeared not to notice and never returned her gaze .
Sitting in the dock , he spent most of the day writing notes and studiously avoided looking back at the public gallery .
"" The whole point was he must see me , that I 'm there , "" she said .
"" I 'm her mother
and you know , what happened to her was terrible .
And I wanted him to see me there , that I am there representing Reeva . ""
June said hearing evidence about her daughter 's death was "" very traumatic , very hard "" .
She continued : "" I tried to keep strong .
There was one occasion where I did n't
and I had a little breakdown , you know where they were talking about Reeva , what she went through and how she was traumatised .
"" You can imagine .
She 's locked herself in the toilet and she 's been shot
and she 's in pain .
I wish I could have been there to protect her .
That 's my child that I gave birth to
and it 's hard for me that she 's dead , that she 's gone .
That was the time I broke down . ""
Her husband , Barry , was not in court after suffering a minor stroke .
June herself did not attend proceedings on Tuesday
She said she can forgive Pistorius , a double amputee who ran in the London Olympics and Paralympics , for his catastrophic actions .
"" I 'm not a person who hates another person , "" she said .
"" One has to forgive , otherwise I will sit with all that anger and I do n't want it to burn me up .
One has to forgive .
We 'll never forget . ""
Pistorius faces a life sentence with a minimum of 25 years in prison before parole if convicted of murder .
The case continues ."
2014-03-04,"Paddy Power 's controversial ad campaign featuring Oscar Pistorius , which offers "" money back if he walks "" , is to be investigated by the UK 's advertising watchdog after receiving nearly 50 complaints .
The adverts , which offer refunds for losing bets if the South African Paralympian is found not guilty of the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp , has been criticised for being in bad taste .
The ASA ( Advertising Standards Authority ) received 46 complaints in two days and has now decided to launch a formal investigation .
The investigation will centre on whether Paddy Power breached advertising rules around causing offence .
The print advertising campaign shows the head of Pistorius superimposed on a statue of an Oscar award .
Next to it , the ad states ""
It 's Oscar Time .
Money back if he walks .
We will refund all losing bets on the Oscar Pistorius trial if he is found not guilty . ""
On its website , Paddy Power encourages "" savvy punters "" to take a "" courtroom flutter "" adding "" who can tell at this point what will unfold ?
But one thing 's for sure , trial verdicts do n't come much bigger than this .
"" Just hours after the ad appeared in newspapers and on social media a petition to halt it was launched on Change.org , which has now attracted more than 110,000 signatures .
The woman who started the petition wrote on Tuesday in a Guardian comment piece : "" [ The trial ] is a huge global moment , but also a story of the tragic loss of Reeva Steenkamp .
To bookmaker Paddy Power , it 's an opportunity to make a few quid and tell some sick jokes …
It must drop the bet , apologise for the adverts and give a donation to an organisation working with victims of domestic violence . ""
Paddy Power 's previous ad campaigns have sparked controversy for targeting "" chavs "" and the transgender community .

2014-03-04,"The mother of Reeva Steenkamp , the woman shot dead by Oscar Pistorius , has told how the Paralympic athlete failed to acknowledge her when his murder trial began on Monday .
June Steenkamp , whose daughter died at Pistorius 's home on Valentine 's Day last year , had never met the sportsman before but attended court on Monday in the hope of looking him in the eye .
"" I wanted to see him and him to see me , "" she told ITV News . ""
But he did n't look at me or anything .
He just walked straight and looked ahead . ""
Steenkamp , who lives in Port Elizabeth in Eastern Cape province , did not attend Pistorius 's bail application hearings last year but went to Pretoria for the opening of the trial .
She stared at Pistorius for long moments but he never returned her gaze .
He spent most of the day writing notes in the dock and avoiding looking at the public gallery .
"" The whole point was he must see me , that I 'm there , "" she said .
"" I 'm her mother
and you know , what happened to her was terrible .
And I wanted him to see me there , that I am there representing Reeva . ""
Steenkamp spoke from her guesthouse on Monday night after hearing Pistorius once again insist in court that he had not intended to kill his girlfriend .
He claims he shot four times through a locked toilet door because he thought she was an intruder .
Steenkamp , 67 , said she could forgive the "" blade runner "" for what he had done .
"" I 'm not a person who hates another person , "" she said .
"" One has to forgive otherwise I will sit with all that anger and I do n't want it to burn me up .
One has to forgive .
We 'll never forget .
"" She was not present in court on Tuesday , when Pistorius 's composure finally broke as he heard graphic details of Reeva 's death .
The defence lawyer , Barry Roux , claimed a gunshot wound to the head would have made it impossible for her to scream .
"" The person with that brain damage will have no cognitive response , "" Roux said .
"" It can not be .
She could not have screamed . ""
Pistorius bowed his head and folded his hands behind his neck , then wiped away tears with a white handkerchief .
The prosecution 's second witness , neighbour Estelle van der Merwe , testified that she heard what sounded like an argument early on the morning Reeva was killed .
"" From where I was sitting it seemed like two people were having an argument but I could n't hear the other person 's voice , "" she said through an Afrikaans - language interpreter ."
2014-03-04,"A woman is dead .
Her family are grieving .
The world is watching as the man accused of her murder faces the court .
It 's a huge global moment , but also a story of the tragic loss of Reeva Steenkamp .
To bookmaker Paddy Power , it 's an opportunity to make a few quid and tell some sick jokes .
Yesterday I posted on Twitter that Paddy Power was offering the chance for people to bet on the outcome of the trial .
Many friends asked if I was joking .
It was so unthinkable , even to those of us who see abuse all day , every day , that a company such as Paddy Power could seek to make a profit in such a flippant way from Reeva Steenkamp 's death .
We posted sad faces at each other .
Then we got angry .
And then angrier .
My heart hurts at the thought of the family 's anguish – and the memories this case stirs up for those of us who have survived domestic violence .
Forty - eight hours later , more than 90,000 people are calling on Paddy Power to drop the bet and withdraw the adverts .
For those of you with no experience of domestic violence and abuse , cases such as this , which the media pounce upon , are hugely difficult and traumatic for all the victims and survivors and the families of those victims and survivors .
Violence and abuse of women slips its ugly fingers around the hearts of anyone it touches .
It stains whole tapestries of interwoven lives with pain .
Children , sisters , mothers , fathers , grandparents , friends , lovers past and yet to come .
Lives are ruined .
Lives are reassembled somehow , but are never the same again .
So , for Paddy Power to see that vast pile of ruin and think that it is an appropriate way to make a profit and keep shareholders grinning makes my blood run cold .
It did yesterday .
It does today .
It will tomorrow .
I started the petition because this is an inhuman thing for a company to do and someone had to .
If it was n't me , it would have been any one of the fine women I meet every day both on and offline , campaigning to keep women safe and help them heal .
If Paddy Power repairs this mess – and it is still defending its position – perhaps we can all focus on justice for Reeva Steenkamp and her family in a sympathetic fashion , as is moral and normal .
The company should listen to the tens of thousands of people who have gone to change.org and signed my petition .
It must drop the bet , apologise for the adverts and give a donation to an organisation working with victims of domestic violence .
Only then can it start to appease the hurt it has caused those who have survived domestic abuse , as I have .
Jean Hatchet is not the writer 's real name ."
2014-03-04,"The murder trial of Oscar Pistorius is gearing up to be a John Grisham - style courtroom drama .
It will be a battle of “ expert ” opinions because the uncontested fact is that on Valentine ’s Day last year Pistorius fired four shots at close range through a locked bathroom door and killed Reeva Steenkamp .
This is not in dispute .
What is in dispute is his claim that he did not intend to kill his girlfriend .
He says he was shooting at somebody else ; that he thought there was an “ intruder ” in the bathroom ; that this killing was a mistake ; that it was not just another South African femicide .
So the trial will revolve around Pistorius’ intention : essentially , the psychology of a man who claims to have been driven by fear to shoot before asking any questions .
This claim inserts a third body into an all too familiar narrative of domestic violence .
This imaginary body of the paranoid imaginings of suburban South Africa has lurked like a bogeyman at the periphery of this story for the past year .
It is the threatening body , nameless and faceless , of an armed and dangerous black intruder .
It is this “ third ” body that will be the most important , even though , as everyone knew as soon as that now famous bathroom door was opened , it did not exist .
That was Steenkamp dying there
and she had made that fatal female error of being in the wrong place at the wrong time .
And yet it is this imagined intruder that will be central to Pistorius defence .
It is this chimera that is going to be the focus of all the court ’s attention .
For the rest of the world it might well be the Icarus - like fall of a crippled Olympian god , but for those of us who live in South Africa it taps into an old and painful vein in which race and sex and power and violence converge .
Perhaps this is the real fascination of the story for us .
These three bodies – one dead , one imagined and one on trial – will play different roles .
The power and the fragility of the human body is made manifest in Pistorius , with his chiseled face , as pared down and inscrutable as a Brancusi sculpture , now more iconic than the images of him as the triumphant Blade Runner .
Both his profound ability and his profound disability will be key to this case – the apparently crucial question of whether or not he had his prosthetic legs on .
Pistorius is , after all , a man who has , quite literally , strategised each and every step he took .
There was no other way he could ever have walked , let alone sprinted , to Olympic stardom .
The dead body – the exquisite corpse – is Steenkamp ’s , of course .
Her body can not but give up its physical secrets .
The answers to the most intimate questions will have been extracted in scientific samples and by scalpel during the autopsy .
Whether she had urinated before she died , whether or not she had her period , whether she had had sex or not , and if she had , with whom .
All this will be made public in the emotionless language of forensic science that tells everything and precisely nothing about the pain and terror of her death .
That we must imagine .
There has been a hum of tabloid speculation about Steenkamp , about whether or not there were other men in her life , about the state of what was only a three - month - old relationship .
These non - questions and non - answers always swirl around the female victim of what is called an “ intimate ” murder , especially if she is young and beautiful .
The state of their relationship – and Pistorius ’s reaction to Steenkamp – will form the bedrock of the narrative of the “ crime of passion ” , which is going to be the basis of the state ’s case for premeditated murder .
This means there is only one area of speculation : Pistorius’ state of mind when he fired at whoever it was he believed to be on the other side of that door .
It is here that the third body comes into play .
Pistorius has insisted that he thought it was an “ intruder ” , an armed and dangerous man intent on robbery , rape and murder .
The figure of the threatening black stranger has driven many South Africans into fortress - like housing estates , surrounded by electric fences , armed guards and the relentless surveillance of security cameras .
This figure is the reason almost every middle - class home has a panic button on both sides of the double bed in the master bedroom , a red button that will summons armed guards to the house within minutes .
So , the accepted logic goes , of course a man would simply shoot .
But what is this fear ?
Where does it come from ?
The estate where Pistorius lived and where Steenkamp died is the contemporary version of the laager .
Except this one is very expensive ; it has state - of - the - art security ; it had no history of crime , let alone violent home invasions .
But for a year this man who was not there , the one who Pistorius did not shoot , has lurked in the shadows of this relentlessly covered story .
Is it a kind of possession , this fear of an intruder that compels a man to unthinkingly and without hesitation fire a gun through a locked door ?
Or is it nothing more than the reclaiming of the old white fear of the swart gevaar ( black peril ) as Pistorius’ only defence against the charge of the premeditated murder of Steenkamp ?
What is this irrational fear that has sunk so deep into the psyche ?
It is perhaps the most atavistic of white South African fears .
Under apartheid , the threat of the swart gevaar was used to excuse any and all kinds of violence .
In the pernicious narrative of “ us ” against “ them ” , these dangerous strangers , these “ intruders ” in the land of their own birth , had to be obliterated .
In that unyielding construct of threat and danger , of your death or mine , there is no middle ground , no compromise and no space for thought or language .
If Pistorius was not shooting to kill the woman with whom he had just been sharing a bed , those four bullets fired indicate that there is still no middle ground .
Because whoever Pistorius thought was behind that door , firing at such close range meant that when he finished there would be a body on that bathroom floor .
So many men in South Africa exist in this state of macho hair - trigger tension in which action comes , all too often , before thought .
This trial will have to weigh up of one version of macho against another .
Either Steenkamp died because of Pistorius ’s drive for the ultimate control over a woman that comes if you kill her .
Or she died , an innocent bystander , of that other macho which has not faded in the 20 years since apartheid , where a notion of total onslaught comes from a deeply entrenched fear of the swart gevaar .
The trial will go through all the ballistics , the bullet trajectories , the blood splatter , the phone records and the meagre facts that Steenkamp ’s body offered up to the pathologist .
But nothing will alter the fact that a gifted man , a strategist , a man who must have considered every single step he ever took , fired deliberately and repeatedly through a locked bathroom door .
The court may well never be able to ascertain what Pistorius’ state of mind was , but nothing will alter the fact that a person died that night because of one man ’s rage or fear .
Is an atavistic fear any less dangerous , any more justifiable , than the blind , narcissistic rage that drives some men to murder the women they sleep with ?
If the prosecution is unable to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt , the judge will have to weigh up whether this fear of an imagined intruder is reasonable and therefore a mitigating factor .
The fact remains that this default to extreme and paranoid violence , whatever its psychological origins , has been so dangerous for women and children for so long in this country .

2014-03-04,"It was a headline casting Oscar Pistorius in the same light as Nelson Mandela that first made Jean Hatchet mad ; "" Long Walk to Freedom – Or Jail
"" ran this weekend 's Sunday Times , linking a sportsman standing trial for killing his girlfriend with a statesman who served a lifetime in jail .
Then she heard about the Paddy Power bet , offering odds on the outcome of the murder trial which started on Monday .
"" I thought it must be a joke at first – or a scam , "" she said .
"" But it was n't . ""
As with many survivors of domestic abuse , the high - profile allegations of violence triggered an instant , upsetting reaction in Hatchet , who uses a pseudonym .
"" A young woman has been killed , "" she says .
"" There 's no doubt that she was killed by this man , whether or not he intended to kill her . ""
She sees Paddy Power 's online bet as "" an incredibly awful , callous thing "" .
Working together with EverydayVictimBlaming ( which accused the online betting company of "" making a killing at the betting shop "" )
Hatchet launched an online petition and encouraged supporters to contact the Advertising Standards Authority about an ad that , presumably in a bid to garner maximum exposure , transposed Pistorius 's head onto one of the Academy awards statues .
The petition has already attracted nearly 100,000 signatures , while 46 people have complained to the regulator so far .
Public comments by the Ireland - based company suggest its spokesmen are not quite sure what the fuss is about .
A marketing man called Paddy Power ( does it come with the job ? ) told the Belfast Telegraph that the firm had "" no intention "" of taking the advert down during a high - profile trail he described as "" like OJ Simpson on steroids "" .
In an email from its press office to the Guardian , the company stuck to its decision . ""
Trial betting in general is n't a common occurrence , but there 's certainly nothing new about betting on the outcome of the most high - profile court cases – and they do n't come any more high profile than this .
Given the rolling coverage of this trial , pretty much everyone will be talking about it and speculating on the verdict .
We 're therefore expecting some of our customers to want to put their money where their mouth is . ""
That 's OK then , is n't it ?
Down the pub , people ca n't get enough of the way Reeva Steenkamp was shot dead by her own partner after locking herself in the toilet .
It 's all a bit of a laugh , is n't it ?
Human nature is a funny thing , eh ?
The nature of celebrity now is that every aspect of their lives is put into the "" entertainment "" or "" sport "" categories of life , even accusations of brutality .
And in the story of Pistorius ( paralympian action man ) , Steenkamp ( blonde , beautiful and nearly always stationary in pictures ) has been forced to play a bit part .
There may be nothing entirely new about the bets .
The difference now is that online bets use a mass media that targets everyone – those interested in the "" sport "" or those victimised all over again by it .
To put it another way , there probably were men at the forum taking bets on lions or men but their audience were all there watching .
The mangled remains of the victims were n't standing by watching the transaction .
Being controversial has never let Paddy Power down before , of course .
Transgender people at the races ( are they stallions or mares ? ) , the old , the blind and chavs have all been targeted by the company 's marketing giants .
And of course any coverage , even this piece , adds to its notoriety ; a sort of catch 22 for anyone concerned that a company should be able to make money from a brutal death .
Hatchet wants the company to donate the profits made from the Pistorius bet to women 's charities working to end violence against women .
Even that strikes an unsavoury note given the source of the profit .
In response , Paddy Power argues : "" We 're offering betting on the outcome of a trial .
It 's about whether Pistorius will be found guilty or not guilty , it 's not a betting market on domestic violence .
"" Supporters might see a warped sense of embarrassment in the company 's offer to return the money of anyone who bets that he will go to prison if Pistorius is found not guilty .
Or a warped sense of logic .
The ad reads : ' It 's Oscar Time :
Money Back if He Walks . '
Meanwhile , Hatchet has found solace in simply reaching other supporters .
Men and women have signed her petition . ""
So many men have signed , "" she says .
"" It 's restored my faith in humanity I think , which was a bit destroyed on Sunday morning . """
2014-03-05,"â€¢ Professional boxer Kevin Lerena , a friend of Pistorius , said the sprinter accidentally fired a gun in a restaurant and asked his friend to take the blame , in a separate firearms related charge .
The 27-year - old is charged with the murder of 29-year - old model Ms Steenkamp and also faces 3 firearms charges .
â€¢ Jason and Maris Loupis , from the restaurant said the group Pistorius was in were apologetic and left soon after the incident .
â€¢ Earlier , the chief defence lawyer Barry Roux sought to undermine the prosecution testimony of couple Michelle Burger and Charl Johnson , neighbours of Pistorius who say they heard screams before shots were fired on the night the athlete fatally shot his girlfriend .
â€¢ Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said Johnsonâ€ ™ s telephone number had been read out in court a day earlier by Roux and he had received a â€œlarge amountâ€ � of calls and a threat which said : â€œWhy are you lying in court ?
You know Oscar didnâ€ ™ t kill Reeva .
Itâ€ ™ s not
cool.â€ �
â€¢Roux argued that similarities in the Burgerâ€ ™ s and Johnsonâ€ ™ s accounts indicated that they had conferred over their answers , which Johnson denied .
State prosecutor Gerrie Nel asks for an adjournment while a new witness is prepared , and the judge says the court will sit again tomorrow morning .
It looks unlikely that this trial will be over in three weeks as expected if it continues at this rate .
The trial has been adjourned .
Loupis :
â€œI asked what had happened .
Darren told me the gun fell out of his tracksuit pants and went off .
I asked him what was the first rule of owning a gun , shouldnâ€ ™ t it be safety first .
He said yes , and I hit him over the head .

Says she did not speak to Pistorius .
Maria Loupis said she heard the gunshot , then the restaurant went silent .
Her husband went over to the table and then she over went over .
Said she was aware of who Oscar Pistorius was .
Maria Loupis , the wife of restaurant manager Jason Loupis , is called to the stand .
Manager says that â€œEverything seemed alrightâ€ ¦ shortly afterwards they paid the bill and leftâ€ � says witness .
Loupis says the restaurant was full of about 220 people when the gun went off Lerena leaves stand with a glance at Pistorius , who is reading his notes .
Next up , Jason Loupis , the manager of the restaurant .
Lerena says he canâ€

He says there was no intent on Pistoriusâ€ ™ part to fire the gun .
with that Roux has finished his cross examination .
Pistorius claims he was checking if there was a bullet in chamber when he fired it by accident .
Roux says he was angry with man who passed him gun , and confronted him about it , which Lerena says he canâ€ ™ t remember .
And we are back .
the cross examination of boxer rKevin Lerena begins .
Roux says that during the incident that Lerena has described , Pistorius did not hear a warning that there was a bullet in the gun chamber when it was handed to him .
Defence prosecutor Roux says that he didnâ€ ™ t know the witness was going to be called , and jokes that he has reservations about questioning a boxer .
The court is adjourning so the defence can look over their notes for further cross examination .
Defence asks for lunch break to start early , which the judge agrees with .
We will now have a two hour break .
Lerena says that Pistorius asked Darren Fresco to take the blame because of his media profile , and he did .
Lerena says Darren Fresco passed a gun under table to Pistorius .
Darren said â€œIâ€ ™ m one upâ€
¦ believe Oscar removed that bullet.â€ � Lerena says a shot went off under the table .
â€œA shot went off in the restaurant .
Then there was complete silence .
I looked down .
I was in shocked .
Where my foot was , saw hole in floor , â€ � he says .
He says that he had a â€œlittle grazeâ€ � on his toe , but he wasnâ€ ™ t hurt but he was in shock .
The prosecution is now taking Lerena through an incident at a restaurant when Pistorius allegedly fired shot under a table .

There were people next to us , says Lerena .
Apologies that our live stream apparently isnâ€ ™ t working at the moment , weâ€ ™ re working to get that fixed .

Now boxer Kevin Lerena , a friend of Pistorius has taken the stand .
He explains how he met Pistorius who he describes as â€œan iconâ€ � .
He says Pistorius was going to helphim with his training .
â€œHe is an icon and a legend in sport and athletics , â€ � he sayd .
Witness Charl Johnsonâ€ ™ s evidence has been suspended for a day as the court waits for copies of his notes which defence has asked for .
The cricket bat which Pistorius used to break down the door of the bathroom where Reeva Steenkamp lay shot is now in court , says Skyâ€ ™ s Alex Crawford .
South African journalist Barry Bateman , senior reporter for Eyewitness News , is also a good choice for live tweets on the Pistorius trial , you can follow him on : @barrybateman .
He explains that the delay at court is continuing .
The Press Association have filed a summary of this morningâ€ ™ s proceedings in court : The chief defense lawyer in Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ murder trial sought on Wednesday to undermine the prosecution testimony of a couple who say they heard screams and gunfire the night the athlete fatally shot his girlfriend , saying similarities in their accounts indicated that they had aligned their versions at the expense of the truth .
Charl Johnson , a neighbor of the double - amputee runner , had resumed his testimony on the third day of the trial after telling the court in Pretoria , the South African capital , that he heard the cries of a terrified woman and shooting around the time that Pistorius killed Reeva Steenkamp in what the athlete said was an accident in the early hours of Valentineâ€ ™ s Day last year .
Johnsonâ€ ™ s wife , Michelle Burger , had given similar testimony and at one point broke down in tears because of what she said was the memory of the terrified screams of a woman .
Defense lawyer Barry Roux said there were differences between the statements that Johnson and Burger had given to police after the shooting , and testimony that they gave in court .
Both the statements and the testimony shared similarities , Roux said , implying that the couple had contaminated their evidence by talking through what they were going to say .
â€œYou could just as well have stood together in the witness box , â€ � Roux said .
â€œWhat do you say to that?â€ �
The tart assertion drew a caution from Judge Thokozile Masipa , who told Roux he had gone too far .
Roux contended that crucial elements in the testimony of the couple were missing in their earlier comments to police , including the statements that they heard a womanâ€ ™ s screams rising in anxiety and intensity and that they heard the womanâ€ ™ s voice â€œfadingâ€ � after the last in a volley of gunshots .
Johnson suggested that he and his wife were more expressive while testifying in court than when providing information for a police document .
â€œI would venture a guess that itâ€ ™ s the way you verbally tell the story , â€ � he said .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s a lot more emotion involved ... whereas the statement is more factual.â€
�
At the beginning of proceedings on Wednesday , prosecutor Gerrie Nel said Johnsonâ€ ™ s telephone number had been read out in court a day earlier .
Johnson then said he had since received a â€œlarge amountâ€ � of missed calls .
He described one voicemail message as saying : â€œWhy are you lying in court ?
You know Oscar didnâ€ ™ t kill Reeva .
Itâ€ ™ s not
cool.â€ � Pistorius , 27 , has said he shot 29-year - old Steenkamp by accident , fearing she was a dangerous intruder in his home .
The case has transfixed people around the world , and the proceedings are being broadcast on television , adding to the scrutiny of South Africaâ€ ™ s criminal justice system as well as the character of a globally admired athlete whose career peaked when he ran in the 2012 Olympics .

â€¢ Defence lawyer Barry Roux said there were differences between Johnson and Burgerâ€ ™ s statements to the police and their testimony , implying they had coordinated the evidence they gave in court .
â€¢ Roux said that key elements in the coupleâ€ ™ s testimony of the couple were missing in evidence given to police , including that they heard a womanâ€ ™
s screams rising and becoming more intense and scared , and that they heard the same womanâ€ ™ s voice â€œfadingâ€ � after a volley of gunshots .
â€¢ Roux tried to establish that Johnson had been woken up by the sound of Pistorius breaking down the door of the bathroom where Steenkamp was found , rather than gunshots , but Johnson said he remained convinced that he had heard gunshots .
Interesting little tweet from journalist in the court Jerome Starkey , who says Pistorius has just acknowledged Michelle Burger talking to Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s relatives You can read more about the Pistorius trial by Zoe Williams
: Here the case does have significance to warrant its exposure ; it opens up a chasm between those who look at this case and see a misogyny that is global and systemic , and those who not only reject that but openly laugh at it , trivialising a womanâ€ ™
s death just to attack the audacity of those who insist upon its seriousness .
Johnson says he made plans to fit security doors on his own balcony .
Roux attempts to get Johnson to agree he discussed upgrading their house security together . , but the witness says he ca nt recall .
There is now a break in proceedings .
Johnson says he believed it was a house break - in because he head man and woman scream and says he was surprised to learn in the news that Oscar Pistorius had been arrested .
Roux suggests that the timings of phone calls made on the night mean that Johnson heard Pistorius breaking down the door of the bathroom with a cricket bat .
Itâ€ ™ s 3.17 am now when you hear the shots .
At 3.19 and 50 seconds , one and a half minutes later , Oscar Pistorius called friend for help : â€œSo we know Oscar Pistorius called friend , Justin Stander , immediately after breaking door , â€ � says Roux .
Johnson placidly insists that he heard gun shots .
â€œSometimes people genuinely believe something has happened and then that is what they tell people .
It is a different thing from it being correct , â€ � he says .
â€œA
manâ€ ™ s life is at stakeâ€ ¦
letâ€ ™ s look at other possibilities , â€ � says Roux .
He also says that the idea of hearing a man scream â€œdoes not fitâ€ � .
Johnson sticks to his version .
We heard scream before and after , says Johnson .
He says the couple assumed something had happened to the man after the shots as they hadnâ€ ™ t heard his voice again .
â€œIâ€
™ m convinced that I heard gunshots , â€ � says Johnson .
Roux is now trying to bring doubt onto Johnsonâ€ ™ s claims that he was woke by screaming .
He tries to weaken the witnessâ€ ™ resolve saying : â€œYou canâ€ ™ t rememberâ€ ¦ â€ � Roux focuses on what woke witness up .
Johnson admits to â€œuncertaintyâ€ � - with the implication from Roux that he could have been woken by shots , not screams .
Witness agrees that he woke his wife up buy jumping out of bed .
â€œSo when your wife woke up you already on
balcony.â€ � â€œThatâ€ ™ s possible.â€
� Roux trying to pull open holes in the coupleâ€ ™ s evidence .
He is trying to argue that they were woekn up by gunshots and any subsequent screams came from Pistorius .
For more Pistorius live tweets the BBCâ€ ™ s Andrew Harding is also in court and tweeting as @BBCAndrewH Roux is on the attack in Pistoria .
When Johnson says that he could not remember the number of shots , but his wife would have recollected this because she is musical and is more likely to count - he pounces .
â€œMr
Johnson , I must stop you .
You donâ€
™ t know what you are doing to yourself , â€ � he says adding that his wife had used the same remark in her testimony , that Johnson says they have not discussed .
â€œYou discussed the evidenceâ€ � , he accuses .
Johnson says â€œI can honestly tell you we did not discuss itâ€ � .
Roux says : â€œWhen witnesses start to use â€˜honestlyâ€ ™ then I wonder about it , â€ � he says .
He adds : â€œ You could just as well have stood together in the witness boxâ€ � and is quietly and calmly chided by the Judge : â€œDonâ€ ™ t you go to far
Mr Roux?â€
� , she says .
Roux says that is for the court to decide , but does not continue the line of questioning .
Roux appears to be suggesting Johnson might have heard his wifeâ€ ™ s testimony in court after al , and points out similarities again .
Johnson , very calmly retorts : â€œIf two people witness the same incident ten metres apart then they will have similar recollections of the event.â€ �
Roux continues to point out that Johnson and his wife Michelle Burger have used very similar language from the witness box .
â€œShe spoke about the scream fading after the last shot and you spoke about fading .
How is that?â€ �
Just a reminder that you can follow the action live in court via our correspondent David Smith who is at the court in Pretoria .
Heâ€ ™ s on @SmithInAfrica Roux is picking up on apparent differences between the tone of Johnson and his wifeâ€ ™ s witness statements and testimony regarding the nature of screams that night .
Roux asks about screaming : â€œYou said it was more intense .
You could hear the fear.â€
�
Johnson says when speaking about something it is normal to use slightly different language .
Johnson says that after the incident he took notes about what had happened .
Roux asks if they can see the nbotes , and Johnson offers his iPad in the witness room to confirm his testimony .
Roux is emphasising similarity between husband and wifeâ€ ™ s testimony , saying they both say they went to bed â€œbetween
nine and tenâ€ � , using the same words .
He appears to be implicitly questioning Johnsonâ€ ™ s claim that he and his wife have not discussed their evidence .
Johnson says he does not think that is strange .
They are â€œhighly routineâ€ � people .
He adds : â€œThat is what time we go to bed .
If you asked me what time I went to bed two weeks ago I would say â€˜between nine and tenâ€ ™
.â€ �
Johnson says he and wife Michel Burger have avoided discussing each otherâ€ ™ s evidence , other than their emotions about the incident .
Johnson says he was sent a message saying â€œwhy are you lying in court .
We know Oscar didnâ€ ™ t kill Reeva.â€ �
The trial has started again for the day .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ lawyer Barry Roux is cross examining neighbour Charl Johnson .
He says his privacy was compromised yesterday when Roux read out his phone number in court .
He says he has had to switch off his phone because he has received many calls , which he said is â€œvery
inconvenientâ€ � .
Welcome to day three of the trial of Oscar Pistorius , who is accused of murdering his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , on 14 February last year .
Our Africa correspondent , David Smith , will be in court D at the North Gauteng high court in Pretoria .
You can follow his tweets here .
You can read his report of the first dayâ€ ™ s events here .
Here is a summary of day twoâ€ ™ s key events : â€¢ Charl Johnson , a neighbour of the athlete , told the court he heard screams and four consecutive shots on the night in question .
He said he had assumed that neighbours were being robbed , and had been surprised to learn the next day that Pistorius had shot Reeva Steenkamp .
â€¢ Johnson said that after realising how close their house was to the crime scene , he and his wife had chosen to speak to a lawyer rather than the police as they wanted to keep out of the public eye .
â€¢ Another witness , Johnsonâ€ ™ s wife , Michelle Burger , again insisted that she heard the screams of a woman , rather than an anguished man , on the night of Steenkampâ€ ™ s death .
â€¢ Burger rejected defence claims that the loud noises she heard coming from Pistoriusâ€ ™ s house were the sound of him using a cricket bat to smash down the door of the bathroom .
She said she heard four loud gunshots , and that the intervals between each were too short for the noises to have been a bat swung against a wooden door .
â€¢ Burger disputed claims that she used her husbandâ€ ™ s witness statement as a template for her own - and denied basing her evidence on â€œretrospective knowledgeâ€ � gleaned from later media coverage .
â€¢
The defence also sought to question Burgerâ€ ™ s evidence by arguing that Steenkamp would have been too severely injured by gunshots to have been able to scream .
â€¢
Another neighbour ,
Estelle van der Merwe , told the court she woke to hear an argument and four noises - which could have been consecutive gunshots - on the night Steenkamp died .
â€¢
The judge has reminded the media not to publish any images of witnesses after a TV channel and several papers carried a still photograph of one witness ."

2014-03-05,"Oscar Pistorius fired a gun in a crowded restaurant , and told a friend to take the blame because of the "" media hype "" surrounding him , a month before he shot his girlfriend , a court heard on Wednesday .
The testimony from a friend of the accused came as the prosecution in South Africa 's high - profile murder trial opened a new line of attack , apparently seeking to portray Pistorius as irresponsible and trigger happy .
Kevin Lerena , a professional boxer who calls himself the KO Kid , said the incident happened at lunchtime on 11 January 2013 when he was with Pistorius and two friends , Darren Fresco and the British sprinter Martyn Rooney , at a restaurant in the upmarket Melrose Arch area of Johannesburg .
Fresco passed his gun to Pistorius under the table and told him there was a bullet in the chamber , Lerena said .
"" A shot went off in the restaurant , then there was just complete silence , "" the 21-year - old continued .
"" Once the shot went off , I was shocked .
I looked down , and just where my foot was stationary there was a hole in the floor .
I had a little graze on my toe .
I was n't hurt or injured . ""
He added that there was blood and "" there could have been a fatality "" , but he did not require medical attention .
"" I did n't expect it , I did n't understand it .
Oscar said , ' is everything OK ?
I apologise .
I do n't know how the gun went off ' . ""
Before the restaurant management approached the table , Lerena continued , Pistorius asked Fresco to say he was responsible for the shot . ""
Oscar said to Darren , ' just say it was you .
I do n't want any tension around me .
Just say it was you .
Please take the blame for me , there 's too much media hype around me ' .
And Darren took the blame for him . ""
Lerena added : "" When Mr Fresco spoke to the restaurant owners , he did say the gun was caught on my [ Fresco 's ] pants , to take the rap for Oscar . ""
Lerena said they paid the bill and left the restaurant , and he never spoke about the incident .
But , he said , two days after Pistorius shot his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , he woke to find more than 100 missed calls on his phone as media from around the world tried to contact him to ask about the restaurant accident .
Jason Loupis , owner of the Tashas restaurant , also took the witness stand .
He said the restaurant was packed with about 200 people that day .
"" I heard a loud bang .
It sounded like a gun
but I hoped not .
I hoped it was a balloon . ""
He walked over to Pistorius ' table and asked what had happened .
"" They all looked at me …
Mr Fresco then said , ' sorry
Jason , my gun fell out of my tracksuit pants ' .
I said , ' are you being serious ?
This is not a joke ' , "" Loupis recalled .
Loupis 's wife , Maria , said : "" Darren spoke to me and told me the gun fell out of his pants , his tracksuit pants … I said to him ' what 's the first rule of owning a gun ?
Safety first ? '
He said ' yes ' , and I hit him over the head . ""
Pistorius paid the bill and the group left , she added .
She also agreed that the shot went off near to where a child was sitting , although the defence countered that a wall was between them .
The incident at Tashas is one of three additional charges Pistorius , 27 , faces at the Pretoria trial .
He is also charged with firing a gun through a moving car 's sunroof , and with illegal possession of ammunition .
The state is expected to use these incidents to illustrate a pattern of reckless behaviour in their argument to prove the "" blade runner "" deliberately gunned down 29-year - old Steenkamp on Valentine 's day last year .
Pistorius denies the charges .
Earlier on Wednesday , the defence counsel , Barry Roux , sought to undermine the prosecution testimony of a couple who live near Pistorius 's luxury home .
Charl Johnson , and his wife Michelle Burger , have testified to hearing a woman screaming , a man shouting for help and then gunshots .
During his cross - examination of Johnson , Roux said phone call records would show that Pistorius called an estate manager at about 3.19am , soon after he used a cricket bat to break down the door of the toilet where Steenkamp died .
Johnson and Burger 's testimony says they heard what they called shots straight after making a call to security at 3.16am .
The similar times show the sounds were that of the bat hitting the door , Roux argued .
"" There is only one thing you could have heard , because it coincides precisely , "" Roux said to Johnson .
"" That was the time that he [ Pistorius ] broke down the door [ with the bat ] . ""
Johnson replied , addressing the judge : "" My lady , I am convinced the sound I heard was gunshots . ""
Johnson also said that after Roux had revealed his mobile phone number in court on Tuesday he had received large numbers of calls and text messages , including a threat which said : "" Why are you lying in court ?
You know Oscar did n't kill Reeva .
It 's not cool . ""
In court were members of the ANC women 's league , and the Gauteng province premier , Nomvula Mokonyane .
They said they wanted to highlight the issue of gender - based violence in South Africa . ""
Every child is my child and [ Reeva ] is my child .
So we will be on the side of Reeva 's mother , "" Mokonyane said .
The case continues ."
2014-03-05,"The advertising watchdog has ordered Paddy Power to pull its controversial ad featuring Oscar Pistorius , after a wave of protest has seen it become the most complained - about campaign ever .
The advert shows a photograph of Pistorius superimposed on a statue of an Oscar award .
Next to it , the ad states ""
It 's Oscar Time .
Money back if he walks .
We will refund all losing bets on the Oscar Pistorius trial if he is found not guilty . ""
The Advertising Standards Authority has so far received 5,200 complaints about the press ads , which offer refunds for losing bets if the South African Paralympian is found not guilty of the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp .
The wave of complaints has in part been fuelled by an online petition on Change.org which has attracted more than 122,000 signatures .
The ASA said the strength of the public outcry has forced it to take the "" unusual step "" of telling Paddy Power to pull the ad immediately .
The watchdog will usually allow a campaign to continue to run until it has finished its investigation into whether there has been a breach of the UK advertising code .
In the case of the Pistorius ad the ASA is investigating whether the ad is offensive for trivialising issues surrounding a murder trial , the death of a woman and disability .
The watchdog said that it is also looking at whether the ad "" brings the good reputation of advertising generally into dispute "" .
"" We consider the ad may be seriously prejudicial to the general public on the ground of the likely further serious and/or widespread offence it may cause , "" the ASA said in a statement published on Wednesday .
"" We are also concerned that the good reputation of the advertising industry may be further damaged by continued publication of this ad . ""
The ASA said that the ad should "" remain out of all circulation in UK media "" until it finishes its investigation , which is being fast tracked .
It is not investigating complaints about the ad appearing on Paddy Power 's website , as the company is based in Ireland and is out of the remit of the UK watchdog .
The number of complaints dwarfs the previous record holder , an ad for KFC that featured people in a call centre singing with their mouths full , which drew 1,671 complaints .
A spokesman for Paddy Power said that the ad was only meant to run as a one - off on Sunday following the Oscars , was not part of a longer media campaign , and only ran in the Sun on Sunday in the UK . ""
Jean Hatchet [ who started the petition on Change.org ] has run an incredibly fast - paced and powerful campaign on the site , "" said John Coventry of Change.org .
"" The past 48 hours have seen a powerful outpouring of support for her story which has pushed the ASA to act . """

2014-03-06,"On the fourth day of the Pistorius murder trial : â€¢ The defenceâ€ ™ s Barry Roux asked witness Charl Johnson about the discrepancies between his first and second accounts of the events on the night of the murder â€¢ Roux suggested that the sounds Johnson heard after screams were Pistoriusâ€ ™ s cricket bat breaking down his bathroom door , and not gunshots â€¢ Prosecutor Gerrie Nel concluded that Johnson had no intent to incriminate Pistorius with his initial notes and testimony â€¢ Roux and Nel both questioned witness Johan Stipp , Pistoriusâ€ ™ s neighbour and a doctor , about his recollection of the sequence of events on the night of the murder â€¢ Roux and Nel both used photographs taken from Stippâ€ ™ s bedroom , where he heard gunshots and screams the night of the murder , to determine Stippâ€ ™ s vantage point â€¢ Roux suggested that Pistorius , anxious and distressed , could have produced the screams that Stipp identified as sounding female â€¢ Finally , Roux and Nel argued over whether Stipp heard shots both before and after he heard screams , as Roux looked to posit that Steenkamp was too fatally wounded to have produced the screams Stipp says he heard Judge Masipa adjourns court for the day .
Proceedings will resume tomorrow , at 9:30am in Pretoria ( 7:30am GMT ) .
Stay tuned for a summary of todayâ€ ™ s events .
Frosted glass and tree leaves obscuring Pistoriusâ€ ™ s bathroom window form the basis of Rouxâ€ ™ s next line of questioning to neighbour Stipp .
From his balcony , Stipp says he could see a light on in the bathroom , which he noticed when he first heard a ladyâ€ ™ s voice screaming .
Roux and Nel go back and forth over whether there were two sets of gunshots heard on the night of the murder .
Nel attempts to draw a line under the exchange : â€œWrong or right , our case is : four shots at 3:17am killed the deceased.â€ � Roux back down , and agrees to â€œaccommodate the state and put it differentlyâ€ � .
Nel objects to Rouxâ€ ™ s line of questioning , as Roux tries to establish which of the shots fired at Steenkamp were fatal .
Judge Masipa says that Roux appears to be conflating the facts from his case with those from the stateâ€ ™ s case .
Roux is picking apart Stippâ€ ™ s first statement to establish the sequence of events on the night of the murder .
After three consulting experts , Roux says , Steenkamp would have been wounded too fatally to be able to scream in the manner that Stipp says he heard .
Roux tries to establish an understanding of the chronology of events , as witnessed by neighbour Stipp .
â€œIâ€
™ m going to put to you that the last two to three sounds , those sounds , were caused by a cricket bat breaking down a doorâ€ � says Roux to Stipp .
â€œBut it sounded to you again like gunshots.â€ � Court is in session again , with Stipp ( Pistoriusâ€ ™ s neighbour ) back on the stand .
Nel concludes with him and now Barry Roux , on the defence , is examining him .
Roux asks about whether Hilton Botha , ex - lead detective on the Pistorius case , took Stippâ€ ™ s statement in February 2013 .
As the trial carried on into the late morning , two witnesses took to the stand :
After the defence re - examined witness Charl Johnson , prosecutor Gerrie Nel stepped up to do the same Nel worked to conclude that Johnson heard several gunshots , and had discussed what he heard at the time with his wife , Michelle Burger Radiologist and Pistoriusâ€ ™ s neighbour
Johan Stipp was sworn in as the next witness and recounted his version of the nightâ€ ™ s events He spoke about the screams and gunshots he heard from his balcony ( 72 metres from Pistoriusâ€ ™ s home ) and seeing Pistorius kneel over Steenkampâ€ ™ s body at the house Nel presented aerial photographs and photographs taken from Stippâ€ ™ s bedroom , facing Pistoriusâ€ ™ s house When Stipp was initially out on the balcony , he says he thought he could hear a manâ€ ™ s voice screaming , quieter than the female screams :
â€œbut I was not sure , and I didnâ€ ™ t include that in my written statementâ€ � .
Nel asks about the three bangs that Stipp heard , and he says they followed each other quickly : â€œalmost on top of each other â€ “ bang , bang , bang.â€ �
After a quick quip from Nel about his tight time - keeping , court is now adjourned for lunch for an hour .
As Stipp goes into more detail about the night of Steenkampâ€ ™ s death , Pistorius bows his head .
From ABC News international affairs correspondent , Hamish Macdonald : Stippâ€ ™ s home is about 72 metres away from Pistoriusâ€ ™ s , making him the closest neighbour to testify so far .
After calling security and sending them in the direction of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s home , Stipp approached the house himself .
He says he spoke to Johan Stander , a security manager at Silverwoods Country estate , and offered to help .
As he walked toward the house , he says he saw a man on his knees and a woman lying on the ground on her left side .
â€œI shot her , â€ �
Stipp says he heard the man say .
â€œI thought she was a burglar
and I shot her.â€

The Pistorius trial channelâ€ ™ s
Twitter account summarises Stippâ€ ™ s account of the events he witnessed and heard :
Stipp says he remembers he was awakened by three loud bangs on the night of the murder .
He walked out onto the balcony and heard screaming , he says : â€œIt sounded to me like the voice of a femaleâ€ � .
Nel has now asked Stipp to point out his home on an aerial photograph of the gated community in which he , and Pistorius , lived at the time of the shooting .
Witness eight , Johan Stephens Stipp , is now being called up to the stand .
He lives in the Silverwoods Country Estate , in the same complex as Pistoriusâ€ ™ s home where the murder took place .

™ t confirm , â€œon memoryâ€ � , how many shots were fired on the night of the murder .
He says that after following the news about the shooting , he became aware that four shots were fired .
Nel has no further questions for Johnson .
And weâ€ ™ re back .
Prosecutor Nel is now questioning Charl Johnson , Pistoriusâ€ ™ s neighbour .
According to David Smith and Barry Bateman , a young man accompanying an advocate into the court room briefly tries to snap a selfie with Pistorius .
Heâ€
™ s asked to stop .

While the court adjourns , our correspondent David Smith , City Pressâ€ ™ s legal reporter Charl du Plessis and journalist Rebecca Davis survey the scene : So far , chief defence lawyer Barry Rouxâ€ ™ s cross - examination of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s neighbour Charl Johnson has focused on : Inconsistencies between Johnsonâ€ ™ s account of how many shots he heard the night of Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s death
Whether the screams Johnson and his wife Michelle Burger heard were made by Pistorius or Steenkamp
Whether Johnson may have heard the sound of a cricket bat , and not gunshots , as Pistorius broke through the bathroom door behind which Steenkamp was locked in his home
And whether Johnsonâ€ ™ s house was so far from Pistoriusâ€ ™ s that Johnson would not have been able to hear screams from inside the toilet in Pistoriusâ€
™ s room Roux steps down , and Nel asks for early tea .
Roux then returns with one last question , to which Nel objects .
Roux questions Johnson on whether he would know what Pistorius sounds like when heâ€ ™ s anxious and screaming .
â€œYou have never met the accused , â€ � Roux says to Johnson .
â€œYou donâ€
™ t know what it sounds like when heâ€ ™ s anxious and he screams.â€ �
Johnson maintains that the sounds he heard were created in such rapid succession that itâ€ ™ s unlikely they could have accounted for the time it takes to swing a cricket bat repeatedly at a door .
â€œSo let us look at your sharp and acute senses , standing on the balcony .
Then let us look at your notes , â€ � Roux says , before stating that Johnson previously said he could not remember how much time elapsed between the shots he heard , and the sounds of screaming that preceded them .
As South Africaâ€ ™ s City Press reported this morning , Roux is bringing up the timestamps from phone calls Johnson and Pistorius made independently of each other , near 3:15am on 14 February 2013 .
Roux is looking to show that Johnson made a call at a time that would imply he had in fact heard the sound of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s cricket bat smashing through the bathroom door behind which Reeva Steenkamp had been shot , and not heard gunshots .
Roux switches from examining the notes , to Johnsonâ€ ™ s experience with firearms .
Johnson says he owns a 9 mm pistol , and has fired a firearm before .
Roux asks whether Johnson has experience hearing gunshots from over 100 metres away , from house to house .
â€œI feel confident that I would be able to identify the sound of a gunshot over those distances ,
â€ � Johnson says .
Roux asks Johnson whether he gave his notes to Maritz because Maritz said he knew prosecutor Nel .
He then goes on to imply Johnsonâ€ ™ s notes from his account of events on the night of the murder are inconsistent .
Johnson says that he did not make it up in his mind that Oscar Pistorius was guilty , when recounting his version of events to advocate Maritz ( the lawyer Johnson and his wife sought legal advice from ) .
â€œI felt a moral obligation as a witness to present a neutral version ,
â€ �
Johnson says .
Johnson and Burger sought legal help , and initially wanted to remain anonymous , Johnson says .
Roux questions Johnson about whether or not he counted the number of shots he heard the night of the murder , and whether he then changed his notes a few hours after he initially made them .
From David Smith : â€œI did not change my version , â€ � says Johnson .
â€œMy initial version was that I did not count them
[ the gunshots].â€ � Prosecutor Gerrie Nel objects to Rouxâ€ ™ s persistent line of questioning , asking Judge Masipa to move proceedings along : Judge Thokozile Masipa and Johnson both seem confused by Rouxâ€ ™ s examination of Johnsonâ€ ™ s wifeâ€ ™ s version of events from the night of the murder .
â€œI also donâ€
™ t follow , â€ � Masipa says .
Roux calls Johnsonâ€ ™ s interpretation of what he heard the night of the murder â€œa designed oneâ€ � . â€œThereâ€ ™ s a design on your side to incriminate , and thatâ€ ™ s unfortunate .
But weâ€ ™ ll deal with it , â€ � Roux says .
Johnson denies an intent to design his testimony in order to incriminate Pistorius .
Roux is honing in on Johnsonâ€ ™ s notes from the night of Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s death .
Heâ€
™ s asked Johnson to read out his notes .
â€œAlso the screams did not sound like fighting , but more like panic and distressed calls of someone being attacked , â€ � Johnson reads .
Eyewitness News senior reporter Barry Bateman is also in court with our Africa correspondent , David Smith : And weâ€ ™ re off .
Charl Johnson , Pistoriusâ€ ™ neighbour , is back in the witness box being cross - examined by chief defence lawyer Barry Roux .
Roux reminded Johnson that he was examining the similarities between Johnsonâ€ ™ s testimony and that of his wife , Michelle .
According to the Oscar trial channelâ€ ™ s official Twitter account : As proceedings begin in Pretoria , have a look at yesterdayâ€ ™ s key events from day three of the trial , as blogged by Alexandra Topping : Summary â€¢ Boxer Kevin Lerena , a friend of Pistorius , said the sprinter accidentally fired a gun in a restaurant and asked his friend to take the blame , in a separate firearms - related charge .
â€¢ Jason and Maris Loupis , from the restaurant , said the group Pistorius was in were apologetic and left soon after the incident .
â€¢ Earlier , chief defence lawyer Barry Roux sought to undermine the prosecution testimony of couple Michelle Burger and Charl Johnson , neighbours of Pistorius , who say they heard screams before shots were fired on the night the athlete fatally shot his girlfriend .
â€¢ Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said Johnsonâ€ ™ s telephone number had been read out in court a day earlier by Roux and he had received a â€œlarge amountâ€ � of calls and a threat which said : â€œWhy are you lying in court ?
You know Oscar didnâ€ ™ t kill Reeva .
Itâ€ ™ s not cool.â€ � â€¢
According to the Press Association , Roux implied that similarities in Burger and Johnsonâ€ ™ s statements suggested they had talked through their testimonies before appearing in court : â€œYou could just as well have stood together in the witness box , â€ �
Roux said .
â€œWhat do you say to that?â€ �
Johnson denied the claim .
Good morning , and welcome to our live coverage of the fourth day of the trial of Oscar Pistorius , the South African athlete accused of murdering his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , on 14 February last year .
David Smith , our Africa correspondent , will be in court D at North Gautengâ€ ™ s high court in Pretoria .

2014-03-06,
2014-03-07,"As was the case yesterday , todayâ€ ™ s proceedings were marked by an aggressive line of questioning from the defence , and brief but targeted examinations from the prosecution .
On the fifth day of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s murder trial : â€¢ Witness Johan Stipp , who lived in Silverwoods estate 72 metres away from Pistoriusâ€ ™ s home , recounted the sequence of events he heard and witnessed from his balcony â€¢ Defence lawyer Barry Roux and prosecutor Gerrie Nel questioned Pistoriusâ€ ™ s ex - girlfriend , Samantha Taylor , who spoke about her experience of his use of firearms and the sound of his screams â€¢ Court was adjourned twice after Taylor broke down in tears , when Roux asked her about the end of her relationship with Pistorius â€¢ Witness Pieter Baba , a security guard on duty the night of Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s murder , testified what he saw and heard from neighbours and in Pistoriusâ€ ™ s house after the gunshots were fired â€¢ Babaâ€ ™ s said that Pistorius tearfully told him â€œeverything is fineâ€ � after neighbours reported hearing gunshots fired in Pistoriusâ€ ™ s house .
This became a point of contention for Roux , who asked for clarification on the sentence several times â€¢ Overall , proceedings moved slightly faster than Thursday and were halted by adjournments and issues of pedantry from previous witness statements Witness Baba says he is not feeling well .
And with that , court adjourns until Monday morning .
Gerrie Nel requests a 10 am start ( 8 am GMT ) because â€œMonday has its own characterâ€ � , while Roux says he prefers earlier .
Judge Masipa decides to start proceedings at 9:30am ( 7:30am GMT ) in Pretoria high court on Monday .
Baba switches to English to restate that , while on the phone to Baba and starting to cry , Pistorius said â€œeverything is fineâ€ � .
â€œYes , I will deal with that on Monday , â€ � Roux responds .
Some details on the phone call timestamps : Roux puts forward that Pistorius called Baba back at 3:24am , and offers to confirm that fact on Monday in court .
Roux asks Baba about phone calls made to security on the night .
He references a 16-second call made by Johan Stipp , in which Stipp told Baba he had heard gunshots .
Roux lists the other calls made to security by Pistoriusâ€ ™ s neighbour , and by Pistorius , with exact timestamps .
Roux begins his cross - examination of Baba , asking about the tracking device used on the security forces patrol vehicles .
The estate manager Johan Stander asked Baba to call the police , Baba says , and he left the scene to do so .
Nel asks if the lights were on in the house , Baba confirms that he remembers they were , and Roux now takes over questioning the witness .
Baba outlines more of his account from the night : Baba says that from his balcony
Stipp pointed to Pistoriusâ€ ™ s house as the source of the sound of gunshots .
Baba then drove to Pistoriusâ€ ™ s house in the security van and called Pistorius on the phone .
The athlete started crying , while saying â€œeverything is fineâ€ � to the security guard , Baba says .
Pistorius then called him back , Baba says , but didnâ€ ™ t speak .
He cried into the receiver and ended the call without speaking to Baba .
( Bakkie is a term for a pickup truck , or light lorry )
Baba was on duty the night of Steenkampâ€ ™ s death .
He says he received phone calls from Stipp and another estate resident , both reporting gunshots heard in the complex on the night of the murder .
Babaâ€ ™ s translator is reading out house numbers for the residents named in Babaâ€ ™ s testimony .
The court appears to be openly broadcasting witness Babaâ€ ™ s live testimony in the trialâ€ ™ s video stream , as was not the case with Samantha Taylor and Dr Johan Stipp this morning .
Nel asks Baba to talk through standard security procedures for admitting visitors to the Silverwoods estate , where Pistorius lived at the time of Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s murder .
And weâ€ ™ re back .
Witness and Silverwoods security guard Pieter Baba , who was on duty the night of the murder , is called to the witness box .
He speaks Afrikaans , and is sworn in with a translator .
Nel asks for an early lunch , and the court adjourns for an hour .
In summation , so far this morning : Witness Johan Stipp gave evidence on the number of shots he heard fired from his balcony , 72 metres from Pistoriusâ€ ™ s home Defence Barry Roux and prosecutor Gerrie Nel both questioned Stipp about when he heard screams , and whether their sound would have carried into his bedroom Witness Samantha Taylor , Pistoriusâ€ ™ s ex - girlfriend , presented evidence on Pistoriusâ€ ™ s gun ownership habits and his past incidents of using and firing guns in public Taylor broke down crying twice , leading to two short court adjournments After Nel is allowed to present the new evidence , Taylor speaks about an occasion when she was sleeping over at Pistoriusâ€ ™ s house
and he believed he heard an intruder in the house .
Pistorius woke her up on one such occasion , she says .
Roux states that Pistorius denied firing the shot through the sunroof , before Nel takes over to examine Samantha Taylor .
â€œHe jumped out of the car , with his gun , and put it to the windowâ€ � Taylor says , of the car that followed she and Pistorius to his estateâ€ ™ s gate .
The defence has put forward that Pistorius jumped out of the car to protect Taylor , while the stateâ€ ™ s prosecutor disagrees .
Court is back in session , and Roux is still questioning Taylor .
He asks Taylor whether Pistorius approached a black car , on foot and with a gun in hand , after the black car followed Pistoriusâ€ ™ s vehicle near his home .
While the court adjourns , have a look at a report on the morningâ€ ™ s proceedings , filed by the Associated Press : A former girlfriend of Oscar Pistorius has testified at the double - amputee runnerâ€ ™ s murder trial that their relationship ended when he cheated on her with Reeva Steenkamp , the woman he fatally shot last year .
Samantha Taylor also testified Friday that Pistorius carried a gun with him
â€œall the timeâ€
� when they were dating , and on one occasion he fired it out of a carâ€ ™ s sunroof soon after a policeman stopped the car they were in for speeding .
The court adjourned briefly after Taylor broke down in tears .
Defense lawyer Barry Roux said he would produce emails between Taylor and Pistorius to show the cheating allegation was untrue .
Pistorius says he killed Steenkamp in his home by mistake , thinking she was an intruder .
Prosecutors say he intentionally killed her after an argument .
Roux goes back and forth on the semantics of Taylor claiming that Pistorius used his cellphone in bed â€œoftenâ€ � versus â€œevery
nightâ€ � .
When he moves on to asking her about how she felt after their relationship ended for the last time , she starts crying .
Court adjourns briefly for the second time today .
Roux is trying to poke holes in Taylorâ€ ™ s memory of 30 September 2010 , the day Pistorius fired a shot through a carâ€ ™ s sunroof .
He is focusing on what she can recall of where she spent the night and morning after the incident .
â€œCan you really remember that day?â€ � Roux asks Taylor .
â€œYes
, I remember him shooting out the gun , very very clearly , â€ � she replies .
Roux is trying to establish whether Pistorius fired the gun in the car out of anger , irritation , or as a joke .
Roux goes back to the sunroof shooting that Nel previously brought up , trying to get Taylor to pinpoint the location of the incident .
And weâ€ ™ re back .
Taylor speaks about the first and second times she and Pistorius ended their relationship .
Rouxâ€ ™ s questions turn personal , and centre on Taylorâ€ ™ s relationship with Pistorius deteriorating in late 2012 .
Taylor starts crying , recounting a time when Pistorius was unfaithful to her , after Roux asks why they broke up .
The court briefly adjourns .
Taylor recounts an incident where Pistorius fired a gun out through the open sunroof of a car .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s friend Darren Fresco was driving , and Taylor was a passenger .
Before Pistorius fired the gun Fresco had been stopped by police for speeding , while driving away from a function by the Vaal river in South Africa .
At this trial , Pistorius faces additional charges linked to this incident , as previously reported by David Smith here .
Nel hands over to Roux .
Taylor says that when he screams , Pistorius sounds like a man and not like a woman .
Previously , defence lawyer Roux has asked witnesses whether it might be possible that screams they heard were produced by a man , and not a woman , in a state of extreme distress .
Taylor , on where Pistorius kept his firearm when they dated : Nel begins questioning Taylor , who says she started dating Pistorius in 2011 when she was 17 years old .
Taylor giggles slightly when asked to describe which side of the bed Pistorius would typically sleep on , and says Pistorius â€ � carried it [ a gun ] around with himâ€ � when they were dating .
And weâ€ ™ re back in session .
The next witness to take the stand is Samantha Taylor , a former girlfriend of Pistorius .
The view from Africa correspondent David Smithâ€ ™ s seat , over the tea break : Brief analysis : Rouxâ€ ™ s aggressive questioning has started to show that , as is relatively uncommon for a murder trial , the defence has come out on the offensive .
Rather than wait for prosecutor Nel to present his case , Roux is focusing on the number of shots witnesses claim to have heard and whether they may have confused the sound of gunshots with that of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s cricket bat smashing through his bathroom door .
Summary of the morningâ€ ™ s events :
Witness Johan Stipp took to the stand again , and recounted the order in which he heard screams and gunshots on the night of the murder Roux questioned Stipp in order to show inconsistencies between Stippâ€ ™ s first and second statements , in relation to the number of gunshots he heard and whether he heard screams before , after and during the first set of shots Roux implied that screams would not have carried as far as the inside of Stippâ€ ™ s bedroom , and uses sound tests conducted on 21 February to back up his point Nel re - examined Stipp , using Pistoriusâ€ ™ s bail application as a guide to align Pistoriusâ€ ™ s own account of events with Stippâ€ ™ s
After a brief re - examination , Nel finishes questioning Stipp and asks Judge Masipa for the court to adjourn early for tea .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel has now taken over questioning witness Stipp , and is recounting Pistoriusâ€ ™ s version of events .
Roux , as in previous days on the trial , presents the argument that Stipp heard fewer shots on the second occasion than on the first .
Roux now moves on from the bathroom window to sound tests done on 21 February : a woman was screaming as loud as she could , to replicate the sounds witnesses have reported hearing on the night of the murder .
Roux spends a few minutes asking Stipp to clarify what he saw when looking across from his balcony to Pistoriusâ€ ™ s house on the night of the murder .
Stipp maintains he saw a person move from right to left in a bathroom window , and Roux asks him to point out the precise window pane in an evidence photograph .
Stipp recounts whether he heard screams before , during or after the phone call he made to security , after heâ€ ™ d heard the first series of gunshots .
From our Africa correspondent , David Smith : Roux asks Stipp about the number of screams that Stipp believes he heard on the night of the murder , based on two separate statements Stipp gave .
Roux is trying to show that Stippâ€ ™ s statements do not match the evidence he gave on the sequence of events he witnessed and heard in his bedroom .
From Eyewitness News reporter Barry Bateman :
And ABC News international affairs correspondent Hamish Macdonald : And court is now in session .
Judge Thokozile Masipa begins by sternly telling off the public and press : â€œif you misbehave , you will be chucked out.â€ � Roux is now cross - examining witness Stipp , starting with questions on how much time elapsed between the gunshots and screams that Stipp heard .
Proceedings are due to begin soon , with witness Dr Johan Stipp under cross - examination by defence lawyer Barry Roux .
Before court reopens , here is a summary of yesterdayâ€ ™ s key events : â€¢ The defenceâ€ ™ s Barry Roux asked witness Charl Johnson about the discrepancies between his first and second accounts of the events on the night of the murder .
â€¢ Roux suggested that the sounds Johnson heard after screams were Pistoriusâ€ ™ s cricket bat breaking down his bathroom door , and not gunshots .
â€¢ Prosecutor Gerrie Nel concluded that Johnson had no intent to incriminate Pistorius with his initial notes and testimony .
â€¢ Roux and Nel both questioned witness Johan Stipp , Pistoriusâ€ ™ s neighbour and a doctor , about his recollection of the sequence of events on the night of the murder .
â€¢ Roux and Nel both used photographs taken from Stippâ€ ™ s bedroom , where he heard gunshots and screams the night of the murder , to determine Stippâ€ ™ s vantage point .
â€¢ Roux suggested that Pistorius , anxious and distressed , could have produced the screams that Stipp identified as sounding female .
â€¢
Finally , Roux and Nel argued over whether Stipp heard shots both before and after he heard screams , as Roux looked to posit that Steenkamp was too fatally wounded to have produced the screams Stipp says he heard .
Good morning , and welcome to our live coverage of the fifth day of Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ s murder trial .
The South African athlete stands accused of the murder of his girlfriend , model Reeva Steenkamp , in a shooting that took place at his home in Pretoria in the early hours of 14 February 2013 .
Our Africa correspondent David Smith will be tweeting live from court â€ “ you can follow him here ."
2014-03-07,"Oscar Pistorius fired a gun through the roof of a car in a fit of petulance after an argument with a police officer , his ex - girlfriend told a court on Friday .
As the Paralympic sprinter stared coldly at her from the dock , Samantha Taylor testified that he carried a gun with him "" all the time "" when they were dating .
It was the latest piece of evidence to call Pistorius 's character into question at the end of a dramatic first week in a murder trial that could only be more tense if South Africa still imposed the death penalty .
Millions of TV viewers watched the prosecution and defence trade blows over what happened on the night one of the world 's most famous sportsmen shot dead his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , a law graduate , model and reality TV star .
The public also had unprecedented access to the grilling of star witnesses and the emotional reactions of Pistorius sitting in the dock , debating every twist and turn of proceedings in real time on Twitter .
Some critics have found the televised trial salacious and obtrusive .
After week one , there are strong opinions on both sides but few would dare to predict the judge 's verdict on Pistorius , a double amputee known as the "" blade runner "" because of his prosthetic limbs .
Along with the murder charge , Pistorius is being tried for three firearms offences , presumably so the prosecution can build a picture of him as hot - headed and reckless with guns .
On one of these counts , Taylor , who was nervous and tearful on the witness stand , claimed that an angry Pistorius had fired his pistol out of a car 's open sun - roof after a heated argument with a police officer in September 2012 .
Taylor said she , Pistorius and a friend , Darren Fresco , had been pulled over by a policeman for speeding .
When he saw Pistorius 's pistol lying on the car seat , the officer picked it up and emptied its magazine on to the floor of the car , prompting an outburst from Pistorius , she said .
When they were allowed to go on their way , Pistorius and Fresco started to joke about shooting out a "" robot "" – a South African term for a traffic light .
"" Oscar was very angry , "" said Taylor , who was sitting in the back seat at the time .
"" Thereafter they were joking around and saying they wanted to shoot a robot .
Two minutes after , I saw Oscar take his gun and shoot out of the car roof .
A very loud sound .
They both laughed .
"" Taylor 's testimony comes two days after the court heard that Pistorius accidentally fired a pistol under the table in a packed Johannesburg restaurant – close to a child – and then asked Fresco to take the blame .
Taylor described two other incidents in which Pistorius drew his gun .
The first was when he jumped out of his car at the gateway of his Pretoria housing complex and put his gun to the window of a black BMW that appeared to have been following him .
The second was when he woke up in the middle of the night after hearing a bang in the bathroom .
"" There was one occasion when something hit the bathroom window and Oscar woke me up and asked me if I heard it , "" Taylor said , noting that the noise had probably been generated by a passing storm . ""
He got up with his gun and walked out of the room . ""
Taylor said she was 17 when she started dating Pistorius and spent four nights a week at his home .
Asked why they broke up on 4 November 2012 , Taylor told the court : "" He cheated on me with Reeva Steenkamp . ""
According to the defence lawyer Barry Roux , Taylor had sent an email to Pistorius apologising for cheating on him .
She explained that there had been an "" altercation "" over a trip she took to Dubai with a man in 2012 when Pistorius was taking part in the London Paralympics , but she was not Pistorius 's girlfriend at that time .
the court revisited the events of 14 February 2013 , when Steenkamp died .
Pieter Baba , who was on guard duty at the gated community where Pistorius lived , said he called the athlete after hearing gunshots in the early hours .
He said Pistorius told him : "" Security , everything is fine . ""
Through an Afrikaans interpreter , Baba added : "" That 's when I realised that Mr Pistorius was crying .
That 's when I said to Jacob [ a colleague ] , not everything is in order as Mr Pistorius was telling me . ""
A few minutes later Pistorius called him back , Baba said .
"" Maybe he was n't sure about calling me back .
He just started crying over the phone .
That 's when the line went off . ""
Roux pressed Baba on whether he could recall if Pistorius had said he was fine or everything was fine .
Baba insisted : "" Mr Pistorius 's exact words were : ' Security , everything is fine ' . ""
Steenkamp died after being hit by three of four rounds fired by Pistorius from a 9 mm pistol through the door of a toilet cubicle in an upstairs bathroom in his luxury home in a Pretoria gated community .
The shooting stunned South Africa and millions of Pistorius fans around the world .
The 27-year - old denies murder , saying it was a tragic accident and that he mistook her for an intruder .
If found guilty , he is likely to spend at least 25 years behind bars . ""
A man 's life is at stake , "" Roux told one witness this week , urging him to consider every possible explanation for what he had heard .
Based on the evidence of the first week , it appears there were two sets of noises heard by neighbours .
The defence claims that the first noises were the four gunshots fired that night , while the second noises were the sound of a desperate Pistorius smashing down the bathroom door in an attempt to save Steenkamp .
The prosecution holds that the second noises were in fact the shots , and is yet to explain what the first set was .
Neighbours have testified to hearing "" bloodcurdling screams "" that suggested a woman knew she was in mortal danger .
The defence is making the unexpected claim that Pistorius screams like a woman when he is anxious and therefore neighbours confused his cries for help with those of a female victim .
It remains to be seen how this assertion will be put to the test .
Roux has quizzed witnesses in minute detail about their testimonies , patiently probing for any contradictions and homing in on any minor discrepancy , sometimes with sarcasm that some observers have found patronising .
The prosecutor Gerrie Nel is yet to reveal his full hand in seeking to prove that this is a case of premeditated murder following an argument .
He has previously made a case that , irrespective of who he believed was behind the toilet door , Pistorius shot with the intent to kill and is therefore bound to be convicted of murder .
The trial has also given South Africans an insight into the workings of the criminal justice system ; more than 70 % told a TV poll that they had found it educational .
Some have been surprised by the tough grilling given to witnesses .
There has also been the spectacle of an accused man sobbing and at one point retching on live television .
The witnesses so far have included a university lecturer , a radiologist and a professional boxer , all but one of whom have been white .
Together they have offered a glimpse of a slice of South African society , including its heavily guarded gated communities where it seems everyone goes to bed by 10 pm .
Not everything has gone smoothly : one broadcaster was reprimanded for showing a photo of a witness who did not wish to be identified , while Roux said sorry for reading out the phone number of a witness who subsequently received numerous calls and messages .
There have also been awkward moments as the Pistorius and Steenkamp families , sitting directly in front of the media , can at times hear journalists ' indiscreet banter .
The case continues with the main piece of theatre yet to come : Pistorius taking the witness stand under the world 's gaze ."
2014-03-07,
2014-03-10,"Day six of the trial has finished and live tweets are no longer available .
Click here for the latest coverage ."
2014-03-10,"It was cold , clinical , scientific testimony that finally robbed Oscar Pistorius of his composure .
A pathologist 's report from the witness stand of the austere courtroom , detailing the devastating impact of three hollow tipped bullets on the body of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp , was punctuated by the gutteral sounds of the sporting celebrity gagging and vomiting repeatedly into a bucket .
While Pistorius has mostly retained his self - possession as a succession of neighbours and an ex - girlfriend gave evidence against him , it was the dry , technical language of professor Gert Saayman that hit him hardest .
He was bent double in the dock , hands on his ears as if trying to block out the words , his body in visceral pain and violently sick .
The scene unfolded on the sixth day of the "" blockbuster trial "" in Pretoria where the testimony was deemed so graphic that judge Thokozile Masipa banned live coverage of it on radio , television , Twitter and blogs .
Saayman was responsible for the post - mortem on Steenkamp , a 29-year - old model , after she was killed on Valentine 's day last year in what Pistorius claims was an accident .
Based on fragments found in Steenkamp 's skull , the forensic pathologist said Pistorius had used an expanding bullet designed to cause maximum tissue damage when he opened fire through a locked toilet door .
Saayman also gave his opinion on how long before she died Steenkamp last ate by the food contents in her stomach .
He estimated that it would not have been more than two hours before she died .
That appeared to contradict Pistorius 's version that suggests the couple had eaten and were in bed by 10 pm .
Steenkamp was shot after 3 am .
The "" black talon "" or "" ranger "" ammunition , made by US - based firm Winchester , is designed to "" open up , flatten out and mushroom when striking human tissue "" , Saayman said .
"" The usual result is it folds out like the petals of flower .
They were specifically designed by the manufacturer to have very sharp jagged edges .
This projectile was designed to cause maximum damage .
It has a black metal jacket .
"" If a surgeon were to operate on a patient shot in this nature you have to be careful as you can easily cut yourself on these edges.""According to Saayman , Steenkamp suffered bullet wounds in her head , hip and elbow and any could have caused her death because of the extent of the bleeding .
She also received injuries from bullet fragments , wood splinters from the door and pieces of her own bone .
A bullet that hit the right side of Steenkamp 's head fractured her skull and entered her brain .
She would have lost consciousness and "" the deceased probably did n't breathe more than a few times after sustaining this wound "" , Saayman said .
"" The wound to the head was incapacitating and probably almost instantly fatal . ""
The bullet wound above Steenkamp 's right elbow shattered her upper arm and she would not have been able to use it if she had survived .
The hip wound would have affected her balance .
"" The chances of one surviving such an injury ...
I would put it off the top of my head at 50 - 50 , "" the pathologist told the court .
He also described exit wounds caused by the bullets and other abrasions and discolouration of the skin , consistent with the impact of a bullet fired through a wooden object such as a door .
Steenkamp was wearing a pair of sports shorts with a Nike logo , a former sponsor of Pistorius and a black undershirt when she was shot , he said .
Saayman stood for his testimony , referring to photographs that were not shown to the gallery and often citing number codes .
Yet it drove Pistorius , a double - amputee known as the "" blade runner "" , over the edge .
The 27-year - old bowed his head and pressed it against the dock 's inner wooden wall , weeping and clasping his hands behind his neck and clutching a white handkerchief .
A blue metal bucket was placed in the dock and he threw up several times .
At one stage the trial was adjourned as defence counsel Barry Roux announced his client had been sick .
Pistorius 's sister , Aimee , joined him in the dock and embraced him for long minutes , but he appeared inconsolable , as if curling into a ball .
Later a reference to a photo showing the "" smearing and scattering of tissue including bony elements , "" made Pistorius rock back and forth and retch .
Masipa asked if Roux could do anything to help his client and if Pistorius was able to follow proceedings .
Roux replied : "" My lady , he 's not fine
but he 's not going to be fine .
He 's having some difficulty .
He 's very emotional but it 's not going to change .
"" Roux then approached Pistorius who indicated that the testimony should continue despite his anguish .
A court official lifted the dock microphone away from Pistorius but the ongoing sounds of distress were impossible to ignore .
Meanwhile , in the public gallery , friends of Steenkamp were also in tears .
After court adjourned for the day , Pistorius sat for a few minutes with his hands over his ears and his body heaving and bent forward as his brother held a hand on his back .
Earlier , prosecutor Gerrie Nel , supported by Roux , said Saayman 's testimony would have an explicitly graphic nature and should not be shown around the world .
Masipa announced a ban on live audio and video broadcasting , and extended the order to live reporting on social media . ""
Twitter is not allowed .
Blogging is not allowed , "" said Masipa , though subsequent reporting was permitted .
The hearing continues ."

2014-03-13,"Oscar Pistorius watched on Wednesday as the scene where he shot dead his girlfriend was reconstructed in an attempt to discredit his defence to murder .
The bullet - pierced toilet door and the cricket bat the Paralympian used to smash it were brought to the high court in Pretoria , South Africa .
A forensic investigator , Colonel Gerhard Vermeulen , dropped to his knees and swung the bat to demonstrate that Pistorius was on his stumps when he hit the door , not , as he claims , wearing his prosthetic limbs .
The double amputee sprinter , 27 , claims he shot through the locked door four times because he believed 29-year - old Reeva Steenkamp to be an intruder .
Realising his mistake , he says he put on his prostheses , tried to kick the door down and finally broke it with the cricket bat .
The prostheses that earned him gold medals , lucrative sponsorships and the nickname "" blade runner "" became central to the case on Wednesday .
In the most theatrical moment of the trial yet , Vermeulen took off his jacket and walked down from the witness stand to the wood - panelled door , in which four bullet holes were visible .
It was attached to a scale reconstruction of the room in which Steenkamp died , including a toilet bowl .
Vermeulen flourished Pistorius 's Lazer bat , which was signed by the South African cricket team – the player Herschelle Gibbs , watching on live television , tweeted that he could see his name on it .
Assisted by two men with a tape measure , Vermeulen knelt and raised the bat like an axe to recreate Pistorius 's actions in the early hours of 14 February 2013 . ""
The marks on the door are actually consistent with him not having his legs on and I suspect they must be similar to the height that he was when he fired the shots , "" he told the court .
"" The marks are consistent with him being in a natural position without his prostheses . ""
The police colonel , who has three decades of experience as a forensic analyst , was repeatedly asked by both the prosecution and defence to demonstrate his assertions by swinging the bat at the door .
He insisted that the angle of the marks and indentations on the door and bat could only have been made by someone much shorter than him .
Pistorius 's counsel , Barry Roux , countered by suggesting that even with his legs on , Pistorius would not be swinging a bat at the same height as an able - bodied person .
He proposed that Pistorius hit the door with a "" bent back "" and the low marks were consistent with such a body position .
Roux asked Vermeulen to kneel and lift his feet , which caused him to wobble .
Roux claimed Pistorius , therefore , would not have been able to balance on his stumps and break down the door using a cricket bat .
Journalist Phillip de Wet tweeted : "" This may become known as the OJ - style ' if the glove does not fit ' moment "" – a reference to a turning point in the OJ Simpson trial .
Roux alleged police had contaminated the crime scene by stepping on the door during their investigation then later wiping the footprints off .
The court was shown a photo of the toilet cubicle taken on the day of the killing with large amounts of blood smeared on the floor tiles ; Pistorius put a hand over his eyes to shield himself .
Roux forced Vermeulen to admit that he had not read Pistorius 's statement until a week ago , not tested the athlete 's claim that he kicked the door and not inquired after missing pieces of the door even though a photo showed them lying near the door in a police basement .
Vermeulen did endorse Pistorius 's account that the shooting through the door came before the bat was used , a boost for the defence 's timeline .
He also said a metal panel on the wall of the main bathroom in Pistorius 's home had been damaged by being hit with a "" hard "" object , or after the object fell against it .
The prosecution confirmed that it now accepts Pistorius 's claim that he was not on his prostheses when he fired the shots that killed Steenkamp .
At last year 's bail application they argued he was planning the killing while putting the limbs on .
Pistorius 's lower limbs were amputated as a baby but he overcame the disability , winning gold medals at the Beijing and London Paralympics and admirers around the world .
He faces a possible life sentence in a South African prison if convicted of Steenkamp 's murder .
The trial continues ."

2014-03-14,"A damning portrait of South African police , contaminating evidence and stealing from the citizens they are supposed to protect , was painted at the trial of Oscar Pistorius on Friday , raising doubts over the credibility of the murder case against him .
Two luxury wristwatches worth thousands of pounds went missing from the Paralympic athlete 's bedroom on the day that he was arrested for the killing of his girlfriend , according to Pistorius 's defence team .
A former police colonel admitted in court that one of the watches had been stolen virtually from under his nose .
The boost for the defence came after the court was shown the first photos taken of Pistorius in the immediate aftermath of the shooting .
Bare - chested and looking shellshocked , he was standing on blood - stained prosthetic legs and wearing shorts covered in blood .
The "" blade runner "" denies murder , contending that he shot Reeva Steenkamp through a locked toilet door because he thought she was an intruder .
Former police colonel Schoombie van Rensburg , who was among the first on the scene of the incident on Valentine 's day 2013 , testified that experts examined a blood - spattered box containing eight wristwatches , worth an estimated 50,000 - 100,000 rand ( £ 2,800-£5,600 ) , and that one went missing even after he warned his officers against theft .
"" I saw those watches and I said , this is tempting for any person because these are expensive watches , "" he told the court .
Van Rensburg described his reaction when he was later told a watch was gone .
"" I said , ' I ca n't believe it .
We were just there .
How can this watch be gone ? '
"" Suddenly his own colleagues were under suspicion .
"" We body - searched everyone .
We searched the whole house .
We even searched the vehicles of every expert at the scene . ""
This proved fruitless and a theft docket was opened , he said .
"" I was furious . ""
When van Rensburg visited Pistorius , he told him to "" remember he 's a celebrity "" and report anything that went missing .
Defence counsel Barry Roux put it to van Rensburg that an additional watch that had been lying on top of a cabinet was also missing .
The former station commander denied knowledge of a second theft .
Van Rensburg , who retired last December , said he later found another investigator mishandling the 9 mm pistol that was used to kill Steenkamp and discarded on a blood - soaked bathroom mat .
"" At that particular moment the ballistics expert was handling the firearm without gloves , "" van Rensburg told the court .
"" I was busy talking on my cellphone when I heard the firearm had been cocked .
I stopped talking and said , ' What are you doing ? '
He said sorry and put the magazine back in the firearm ...
So immediately I was very angry .
"" The ex - colonel said he recognised the toilet door through which Pistorius shot as the "" most valuable "" piece of evidence and decided to take it away in the biggest body bag available .
He conceded : "" As we carried this door , the loose panels of this door were shifting and we were afraid it was going to crack the body bag , which was plastic . ""
Then there was a problem finding a big enough vehicle to transport the door .
Van Rensburg said he stored the door in his office at the police station because it was too big to fit in the area normally reserved for evidence from crime scenes .
The second week of the trial ended with the prosecution confessing that the digital camera used to take photos of the scene had labelled them with the wrong date and wrong year , prompting a scornful aside from Pistorius to his uncle .
Under the world 's gaze , the trial threatens to become the latest body blow to the reputation of the South African police .
This month alone an official inquiry into the 2012 Marikana massacre heard that some mineworkers were shot dead by officers "" execution - style "" as they surrendered with hands in the air , while police in Cape Town were caught on video kicking and punching a naked Nigerian man .
Last year , a South African parliamentary committee heard that 1,448 members of the police have criminal convictions , including for murder , rape and theft .
Earlier , the court saw two dramatic images of a disoriented , shirtless Pistorius wearing blue blood - soaked shorts and with dried blood on his left arm shortly after the killing .
Tattooed words and red tape , apparently because of a sporting injury , were visible on his muscular back .
The trial will resume on Monday ."

2014-03-18,"Oscar Pistorius was standing on his stumps nearly three metres from a locked toilet door when he opened fire and killed his girlfriend , testimony from a ballistics expert indicated on Tuesday .
South African police captain Chris Mangena said he placed a tripod 220 cm from the door while trying to reconstruct the incident , then shone a laser to establish the trajectory of the four bullets fired by the Paralympian .
Mangena added that Pistorius 's arm length with hand in a grip position , as if holding a gun , measures 66 cm , implying that he was standing a total of 286 cm from the door when he pulled the trigger .
The double amputee sprinter is on trial for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp , a model and law graduate , at his home in Pretoria on Valentine 's day last year .
He insists that he mistook her for a burglar .
Mangena , a ballistics expert with two decades ' experience , told the high court on Tuesday that he used Pistorius 's account of that night as a benchmark for reconstructing the scene . ""
When I looked at the version of the accused , he stated that when he fired the shots he was not wearing the prostheses , so he was on his stumps , "" Mangena said .
"" In this incident , for me to reconstruct the crime scene , I had to get the height of the accused so that I can determine whether he was wearing the prostheses or not wearing the prostheses . ""
The captain therefore requested that Pistorius 's measurements be taken at a company called Ergonomics Technologies , north of Johannesburg .
This determined that his height while wearing the prosthetic limbs is 1.84 metres , compared with 1.55 metres on his stumps .
His height - to - shoulder level is 1.56 metres with the prostheses and 1.23 metres without .
His height to elbow level is 1.26 metres with the prostheses and 0.96 metres without .
Mangena , who was present when the measurements were done , said the prostheses that Pistorius was wearing on the day of the shooting were 62 cm .
Last year prosecutors alleged that Pistorius was wearing his prostheses when he fired through the door , claiming that the time he took to put them on was evidence of premeditated murder .
In his statement , Pistorius claimed he was in a panic and ran to the bathroom on his stumps .
The prosecution has since accepted this version .
Mangema testified that , of the four bullets fired , one had missed Steenkamp and ricocheted off a wall before hitting another wall in the cubicle .
The other three hit her .
He said he received Pistorius 's damaged toilet door on 7 March last year and tested for gunshot residue to determine the distance from which the shots had been fired .
Bullet hole A was at a 93.5 cm height from the bathroom floor , B was 104.3 cm , C was 99.4 cm and D was 97.3 cm , he testified .
Mangena said he used steel rods and lasers to work out the angle of the bullets .
The captain matched his findings with photos from Steenkamp 's postmortem .
His description of her wounds upset Steenkamp 's mother , June , prompting a member of the African National Congress women 's league to put a consoling arm around her .
Pistorius , 27 , sitting in the dock and impassive for most of the day , bowed his head and wept softly .
The trial continues ."
2014-03-19,
2014-03-19,"Oscar Pistorius 's girlfriend was standing in a toilet cubicle facing the locked door when she was hit in the right hip by the first of four bullets fired by the Paralympic athlete , a ballistics expert testified on Wednesday .
The widely - watched murder trial in Pretoria , the capital of South Africa , also heard that Pistorius looked at pornographic and car websites on his iPad the night before he shot and killed Reeva Steenkamp .
The sprinter , known as the "" blade runner "" because of his carbon - fibre prosthetic limbs , faces a possible life sentence if convicted .
He insists that the killing was accidental because he mistook the model and law graduate for an intruder .
Police ballistics expert Chris Mangena told the court that the first shot broke Steenkamp 's right hip bone . ""
The best probable explanation is the deceased was initially upright behind the closed door ; she sustained a penetrating wound in the right side of the hip , "" he said .
"" I 'm of the opinion that after this wound was inflicted , she dropped immediately . ""
Steenkamp then slumped into a "" seated or semi - seated position "" on top of a magazine rack in the cubicle .
The second bullet missed her and ricocheted off the wall and broke into fragments , bruising her back , Mangena said .
With her arms crossed over her head to protect herself , Steenkamp was then hit in her right arm and in the head by the third and fourth shots fired by Pistorius with his 9 mm pistol , he said .
She collapsed with her head on the toilet seat . ""
The deceased was seated in a defensive position , "" Mangena testified .
"" The arm was lifted up , and was in front of her chest ...
Reeva must have had both hands covering her head protectively .
The last bullet hit her on the head , breaking the skull . ""
The bullet that struck Steenkamp 's skull broke into two fragments , one of which exited her head and struck the wall behind her , he continued .
Pistorius plugged his ears with his fingers as the graphic account was given .
The ballistics report appeared to support earlier witness testimony that Steenkamp had time to scream before she died and undermine the defence 's version that she could not have made a noise .
The first witness at the trial , Pistorius 's neighbour Michelle Burger , testified to having heard "" bloodcurdling screams "" before four shots went off .
The ballistics report also appeared to support Burger 's account of a pause between the first and second shots .
Mangena said Pistorius fired from a distance of at least 60 centimetres and no further than a wall behind him , about three metres away .
He added that Pistorius was probably on his stumps when he fired , supporting the athlete 's original defence statement .
He also described the impact of the type of bullets in Pistorius 's gun , which were designed to cause maximum damage .
"" It hits the target , it opens up , it creates six talons , and these talons are sharp .
It cuts through the organs of a human being . ""
Another witness , colonel Mike Sales , investigated the web history on two iPad tablets found in Pistorius 's home .
He analysed the activity on one of the devices hours before Steenkamp was killed , he said .
According to records shown on TV monitors in court , a search was made on Google for a pornographic website .
Then a page was accessed that was described with the words "" Mobile Porn , Free Mobile Porn , iPhone Porn , Phone Porn , iPad Porn "" .
Other web searches referred to car sites and details on cars , including a Ford Ranger SUV , an Aston Martin and a British - made Morgan sports car .
Sales said the searches and website history on the second iPad showed similar records to the first .
The trial was adjourned until Monday .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel told the court that the state would be ready to rest its case next week , bringing closer the moment when Pistorius will take the stand as a witness ."
2014-03-20,"Oscar Pistorius plans to sell the 5 m rand ( Â£277,000 ) house where he shot dead his girlfriend to cover spiralling legal fees for his murder trial , his lawyer said on Thursday .
The Paralympian has not gone back to the house in a gated community in Pretoria since he killed Reeva Steenkamp in an upstairs bathroom last year .
"" It has become necessary to sell Mr Pistorius 's home in the Silver Woods Country Estate in Pretoria in order for him to raise the necessary funds to cover his increasing legal costs , "" lawyer Brian Webber said .
"" This is due to the unexpected extension of the trial beyond the initial three - week period for which it was originally set down . ""
Pistorius , 27 , has been funding his own defence since his arrest , Webber said .
"" Due to the delay in finalising the trial , the decision to urgently dispose of his single biggest asset has had to be made .
Mr Pistorius has never returned to his home in Silver Woods since the tragedy of 14 February 2013 .
Mr Pistorius can not contemplate ever returning to live there again . ""
In the statement designed to "" pre - empt speculation in the public and the media "" , Webber added : "" Despite the fact that the house was handed back to Mr Pistorius by the authorities more than a year ago , a decision was taken to keep the house sealed until after the trial .
He has been forced to revisit this decision due to the reasons outlined in this statement . ""
Estate agent Ansie Louw , who is handling the sale , told AFP that the house will be sold in a closed auction , starting at 5 m rand .
Such a price tag is likely to deter ghouls and opportunists .
Pistorius denies the murder of Steenkamp , 29 , a model and law graduate .
He protests his innocence , claiming that he mistook her for a burglar when he shot four times through a locked toilet door .
During the trial the court has seen photos of the inside of the house with its minimalist design of white walls , brown stone tiled floors and steel balustrades .
It has also heard evidence from neighbours who included a radiologist , university academic and IT designer .
Pistorius 's defence costs are estimated at 150,000 to 200,000 rand ( Â£8,301 to Â£11,068 ) a day for at least three full - time lawyers in court , plus ballistics and forensics experts and a US crime scene reconstruction company .
Defence counsel Barry Roux is rumoured to be earning around 50,000 rand ( Â£2,767 ) a day .
Laurie James , a criminologist following the case , said : "" At 200,000 a day anyone would struggle to fund the defence .
Even if he walks out exonerated , what sponsor is going to touch him in the future ?
What brand would want to make itself toxic ? ""
William Booth , a lawyer and commentator , said : "" It becomes ridiculous that legal fees are so high .
It 's beyond the ability of most people in South Africa to afford the legal team assembled here .
It 's an unreal scenario .
"" Pistorius , who has lost a series of lucrative sponsorship deals since the tragedy , valued the house at 5 m rand during his bail application in February last year .
At the time he also owned two other houses with a value of 1.5 m rand ( Â£83,013 ) in Pretoria and a vacant plot worth 1.6 m rand ( Â£88,548 ) in Cape Town .
All his properties together were worth 8.3 m ( Â£459,342 ) rand , he told the court .
Since the shooting , Pistorius has been living at his uncle Arnold 's house in Pretoria .
Prosecutors are expected to wrap up their case early next week .
The trial resumes on Monday ."
2014-03-23,"At the end of each day Oscar Pistorius walks back into prelapsarian fame .
When his murder trial adjourns , he steels himself for a moment , then steps outside through a corridor of cameras as a bodyguard shouts "" Make way ! ""
On the street , police restrain schoolchildren craning their necks and camera phones shouting "" Keyo keyo keyo Oscar !
[ Here 's Oscar ] "" , as he climbs into a vehicle with tinted windows .
For a moment , the clamour is like the days when Pistorius , the first amputee to run in the Olympics , was a hero without a victim .
It is a brief respite for the sportsman , who shuttles between his uncle 's mansion in Pretoria , and the austere court , a wooden cocoon with its own rules and rituals , which can make the outside world seem unreal .
Pistorius , 27 , sits on a bench in the dock , by turns staring implacably , taking notes , resting hand on head , weeping or vomiting , as he is force - fed action replays of the moments that ended one life and broke his own .
Case number CC 113/13 , or the media extravaganza that is "" the Kardashians meet OJ Simpson "" in the words of crime writer Margie Orford , will reach a critical point this week when the prosecution presents its final witnesses and rests its case that Pistorius murdered his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in cold blood on Valentine 's Day last year .
What is expected to follow is the episode on which the entire trial may turn : the appearance of Pistorius on the witness stand .
It will be the most theatrical moment yet in a trial that has already broken new ground as an exercise in justice as public spectacle .
For some , gavel - to - gavel TV and radio coverage is providing an unprecedented education about the workings of the courts , albeit a version that few poor people would recognise .
It is also demonstrating that , when post - apartheid South Africa is held up to the light of global scrutiny , not everything must be seen through the prism of race .
For others , however , the presence of cameras in the courtroom , and the obsessive compulsions of newspapers and websites , is a trivialising force that diminishes the majesty of the law into the stuff of soap opera .
At worst , they say , as journalists tweet the accused 's every tear , retch or prayer to a global audience , there are disquieting echoes of mob justice .
"" I sit there with my kids and on one level
it 's good
they get an education about the law and see that life as an advocate is painstaking and not the glamour you normally get on TV , "" said Craig Freimond , a writer and director .
"" But on another level we 're sitting at dinner and still talking about what angle the blood spattered .
It 's all a bit weird . ""
Such anxieties will peak when Pistorius , once a superstar best known as the "" blade runner "" because of his prosthetic limbs , is cross - examined about his claim that he shot four times through a locked bathroom door because he mistook Steenkamp , a model and law graduate , for an intruder .
Given the pitiful figure he cut at last year 's bail application hearing and at times during the trial – heaving , shaking , sobbing uncontrollably , the whole world his prison – his defence team may have concerns about his psychological readiness .
Laurie James , a criminologist , said : "" He 's going to be torn apart and he knows this .
I do n't think the prosecutor , Gerrie Nel , will give Oscar Pistorius an inch when he takes the stand .
Given his depleted state of mind , he 's in a position where anyone would find it hard to deal with . ""
James has spoken to Pistorius during the trial and he told her he was feeling very tired . ""
He 's probably not sleeping well , "" she said .
"" How the guy has n't cracked by now , I do n't know .
It must be that he has a strong family support system and a very good legal team . ""
Pistorius seems likely to exercise his right to remain invisible to TV viewers during his testimony , although they will be able to hear him .
Some believe this could cost him public sympathy .
George Mazarakis , executive editor of a dedicated Oscar Pistorius trial channel , said : "" We intimated to his team that they 're making a mistake by not allowing him to appear . ""
Mazarakis rejects the view that the televised cross - examination is a 21st - century version of mob rule .
"" It 's not that crude , "" he said .
"" The principle of justice being done is an important one .
The principle of open justice is an important one . ""
The 24-hour channel is believed to be pulling in more than 200,000 viewers a day , making it one of the most popular in South Africa , and its Twitter account has 114,000 followers .
"" We have been very careful about not sensationalising things and having serious legal analysis , "" said Mazarakis .
In court , the families of Pistorius and Steenkamp sit on opposite ends of the front row of the public gallery .
In recent days , the Pistoriuses have tried to make peace with Steenkamp 's mother , June .
A row behind are journalists with laptops whose typing surges and wanes like rain , depending on the revelatory value of the testimony .
From this vantage point , the view is of Pistorius 's back .
Beyond him the two legal teams , led by prosecutor Nel and defence counsel Barry Roux , whose sardonic cross - examinations bear the hallmark phrase : "" I put it to you … "" People have sought his autograph or to take "" selfies "" with him ; a parody Twitter account has been launched in his name ; and a local radio station has recorded a rap song : "" I put it to you / that it is true / everything you say / I will misconstrue … "" Sitting on high at the far side of the court , flanked by two assessors , is the red - gowned judge , Thokozile Masipa , a former crime reporter who mostly indulges Roux 's showboating but occasionally puts her foot down .
In the absence of juries – and of the death penalty – in South Africa , it is Masipa who will decide whether Pistorius must go to prison .
Then there are the witnesses , each trailing biographical clues in their names , dress , accents and occupations that would give Sherlock Holmes a field day .
The parade "" gives a glimpse into rich , diverse , flawed and accomplished lives , swept into a single narrative from previously anonymous routines , "" noted an Associated Press report .
There are Pistorius 's well - to - do white neighbours at the Silver Woods estate in Pretoria , a gated community of soulless architecture where residents apparently go to bed before 10 pm .
A university academic with a PhD who described hearing "" blood - curdling screams "" on the night of the killing .
A doctor specialising in radiology with a smooth bedside manner who casually referred to his "" domestic servant , "" illuminating a back story of patrician white privilege .
The court has also met Pistorius 's pals , a different social circle involving fast cars , guns and girls .
"" If it 's got wheels or a skirt it 's gon na cost you money , "" reads the caption on the Twitter page of Darren Fresco , who has long hair and a facial scar and uttered the only f - word of the trial so far .
He was driving well above the speed limit when Pistorius allegedly fired a gun through his sunroof and was there when a pistol went off in a restaurant in the presence of another witness , boxer Kevin "" KO Kid "" Lerena .
Finally , there are the experts .
Gert Saayman , a pathologist , described Steenkamp 's wounds with such delicate precision that Pistorius threw up .
"" Death is effectively a process rather than an event , and may take some minutes for it to come to its conclusion at a physiological level , "" he said .
But police witnesses have been skewered by Roux over contaminated evidence , contradictory statements and even stealing from Pistorius 's home .
Mostly white Afrikaner men who grew up under apartheid and joined the force just as the old order was crumbling , their looks and methods call to mind the BBC drama Life on Mars about hard - drinking cops in 70s Manchester .
Yet as Pistorius , the judge , the lawyers , the family , the journalists and the public prepare to reassemble on Monday under the strip lights of the courtroom , this is a case that defies glib categorisation – a rare South African story in which race has been reduced from headline to mere subtext .
Unlike the Simpson trial , there is no racial division between perpetrator and victim .
Many of those schoolchildren who gather to witness Pistorius 's daily exit from the courthouse are black .
And what is most extraordinary about Masipa presiding over South Africa 's mega - trial is how ordinary it is . ""
Twenty years ago it would have been unthinkable to have a black female judge , "" Mazarakis said .
"" The respect she is shown is indicative of the normalisation of the society and how we should n't make too much of it . ""
South Africa is still far from the non - racial society that Nelson Mandela envisaged .
But the unique social experiment in justice being seen to be done that is the Pistorius trial is a reminder of the danger of a single story .
Chris Thurman , an academic and newspaper columnist , said : "" On one level , race is always explicit in South African discourse .
But there are also public spaces where we are happy for race to be absent .
We 're wrong if we cling to the belief that race is the only axis on which South Africa can be understood . """

2014-03-24,"Oscar Pistorius 's girlfriend told him "" I 'm scared of you sometimes , "" less than three weeks before he shot and killed her at his home , a court heard on Monday .
Reeva Steenkamp , a model and law graduate , complained to the Olympic and Paralympic sprinter that they were in "" a double standard relationship "" plagued by his jealous tantrums , according to intimate messages extracted from her phone .
The high court in Pretoria , South Africa , sat in rapt silence as Steenkamp 's words were heard in the case for the first time .
Pistorius , who is accused of murdering the 29-year - old on Valentine 's day last year , sobbed in the dock as the couple 's tempestuous romance was exposed in unsparing detail to his family and Steenkamp 's mother and friends .
"" You have picked on me excessively â€ ¦
I do everything to make you happy and you do everything to throw tantrums , "" said a WhatsApp message sent by Steenkamp to Pistorius on 27 January 2013 .
"" I 'm scared of you sometimes and how you snap at me and of how you will react to me . ""
You make me happy 90 % of the time
and I think we are amazing together
â€
¦
but I am not some other bitch
â€ ¦ trying to kill your vibe
â€
¦
I 'm the girl who fell in love with you
but I 'm also the girl who gets side - stepped when you are in a shit mood
â€
¦ I get snapped at and told my accent and voices are annoying . ""
The messages were read out to court by police mobile phone expert Francois Moller on day 14 of the high - profile trial .
Pistorius denies murder , claiming he shot four times through a locked toilet door because he thought he heard an intruder .
The exchanges revealed Steenkamp disliked Pistorius 's jealousy : "" We are living in a double standard relationship .
Every five seconds I hear about how you dated another chick .
You really have dated a lot of people yet
you get upset if I mention one funny story with a long - term boyfriend .
"" In one incident , Steenkamp was upset about being forced to leave a friend 's engagement party prematurely . ""
I was not flirting with anyone today .
I feel sick that you suggested it
â€
¦ I am terribly disappointed how the day ended .
"" Pistorius wrote back : "" I want to talk to you .
I want to sort this out .
I do n't want to have anything less than amazing for you
and I 'm sorry for the things I saw without thinking and for taking offence to some of your actions . ""
He said that his illness that day was not "" an excuse "" , adding : "" I was upset that you just left me after we got food to go talk to a guy
and I was standing right behind
you watching you touch his arm and ignore me , and when I spoke up you introduced me which you could 've done
but when I left you just kept on chatting to him when clearly I was upset .
"" The couple , who had been dating a few months , had a further argument when they attended a function and Steenkamp felt publicly humiliated .
She wrote later : "" I completely understood your desperation to leave and thought I would be helping you by getting to the exit before you because I ca n't rush in the heels I was wearing .
I thought it would make a difference in us getting out without you being harassed anymore .
I did n't think you would criticise me for doing that , especially not so loudly that others could hear . ""
She continued : "" I might joke around and be all tomboyish at times but I regard myself as a lady and I did n't feel like one tonight after the way you treated me when we left .
I 'm a person too
and I appreciate that you invited me out tonight
and I realise that you get harassed
but I am trying my best to make you happy
and I feel as though you sometimes never are ,
no matter the effort I put in .
"" I ca n't be attacked by outsiders for dating you and be attacked by you , the one person I deserve protection from . ""
In another conversation on 19 January , Steenkamp wrote to her boyfriend : "" Baba â€ ¦
There are a lot of things that could make both of us feel like shit â€
¦
I 'm just very honest â€
¦
I wo n't always think before I say something .
Just appreciate that I 'm not a liar . ""
Steenkamp had been away filming a reality TV series called Tropica Island of Treasure .
Pistorius wrote to her : "" I know .
It was just when you got back from tropica you made it sound like you had only smoked weed once and then last night that came out .
I do n't know how many times you took it or if you took other things or what you did when you were on them . ""
Steenkamp said : "" I 'm sorry if it upset you .
It was n't my intention . ""
Pistorius replied : "" I do appreciate it .
Could never be with someone that was . ""
Steenkamp sent another message : "" I was n't a stripper or a ho . ""
Despite the evidence of a volatile relationship , Moller said : "" Ninety percent [ of all the messages ] were normal conversations and loving conversations . ""
The court also heard messages in which Pistorius appeared to confirm allegations that he asked a friend , Darren Fresco , to take the blame after a gun went off in a restaurant . ""
Angel please do n't say a thing to any one , Darren told everyone it was his fault â€
¦
I ca n't afford for that to come out .
The guys promised not to say a thing . ""
Moller said he had been able to extract some 35,654 pages ' worth of messages from Steenkamp 's phone .
The evidence was hailed as unprecedented in South African legal history .
Toby Shapshak , a consumer technology expert and editor of Stuff magazine , told the Oscar Pistorius trial channel : "" What 's amazing about this event is this is really pretty cutting edge stuff that 's probably going to set a precedent for court cases and murder cases around the world . ""
This is not a neighbour saying , ' I think the light was on , maybe the light was off , maybe I heard screaming . '
This is black and white hard proof and the useful thing for a prosecution or defence is that everything is time stamped . ""
Earlier on Monday , a neighbour of Pistorius testified that she heard gunshots , the "" terrified , terrified "" screams of a woman and then a second set of gunshots on the night of the shooting .
Anette Stipp 's testimony matched some of the evidence given by other witnesses earlier in the trial .
The case continues ."
2014-03-25,"David Smith 's report on the trial today has just been published .
Here 's the top : Prosecutors closed their case against Oscar Pistorius on Tuesday , but it remains uncertain when the athlete will give evidence in his own defence . ""
That is the state 's case , "" the lead prosecutor Gerrie Nel told the court , having called 20 witnesses from an original list of 107 to support the state 's argument that the Paralympic sprinter deliberately killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp .
The defence then called an adjournment and declined to comment on whether Pistorius would be first to testify when the trial resumes on Friday .
Asked by journalists whether he was prepared , a tired - looking Pistorius replied : "" It 's a tough time . ""
This liveblog is now closing up .
Here 's a round - up of Tuesday 's developments in the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp .
â€¢
The state has finished its case .
The judge granted an adjournment to allow Pistorius ' lawyers to consult with witnesses , and the defence will begin its case on Friday morning , when the court returns .
One of the defence team has said it is "" likely "" that Pistorius will be first to give evidence .
â€¢ A prosecution witness , Colonel Gerhard Vermeulen , was recalled by the defence to answer questions about a "" new "" mark at the top of the toilet door that was broken down by Pistorius to reach the dying Steenkamp .
Vermeulen admitted he had not checked this mark against the cricket bat used by Pistorius to break the door ; the defence argued that the height of the mark indicated that Pistorius had put on his prosthetic legs after the shooting , which the accused maintains and the prosecution disputes .
â€¢
The prosecution has detailed calls made to and from Oscar Pistorius ' phones on the night of Reeva Steenkamp 's death , which showed that after alerting security guards and the ambulance service he rang his friend , his brother and his manager .
An expert witness agreed that a call to Pistorius ' own voicemail had probably been made accidentally .
â€¢ Mobile phone evidence showed that Pistorius made the first call to estate security guards and was then called back by them , contradicting earlier evidence from a guard that he had rung the athlete first .
â€¢ Police warrant officer Adriaan Maritz told the court the police computer system had no record of Pistorius ever reporting a crime or being the victim of one .
Defence lawyer Barry Roux insistedPistorius had been "" a victim of crime on many occasions "" and pointed out that police responding to calls about the shooting of Steenkamp had come from a nearby house robbery , as both sides tried to paint a picture of Pistorius ' fear ( or otherwise ) of being attacked in his home .
â€¢
The defence has sought to show that the relationship between Pistorius and Steenkamp was a loving one , following Monday 's revelations that Steenkamp has said she was "" scared "" of her boyfriend .
Texts and WhatsApp exchanges were read to the court , and CCTV images of the pair showed them kissing as they shopped for groceries .
Roux said these showed that any arguments were swiftly resolved , adding that of over 1,700 messages , the prosecution had found only four that showed rows between the couple .
â€¢ Steenkamp had offered to cook dinner for Pistorius on Valentine 's day
â€
“
she was killed in the early hours of that morning .
â€¢ There was evidence that Pistorius had been having trouble with an injured shoulder ; the defence suggested it would return to this point .
We have a bit more information on why the defence team has requested time to prepare before opening its case .
The state list of potential witnesses numbered 107 , of which only around 20 were actually called to give evidence in the trial .
The defence now needs time to consult with those witnesses who were on the list but not called , to see if they have testimony that could help Pistorius ' case .
One "" unused "" witness who seems likely to be called would be Hilton Botha , the initial investigating officer in the Steenkamp case .
He was the first police officer to arrive at Pistorius ' home but has been accused by the defence of contaminating the scene .
Botha was removed from the investigation after only a week , following revelations that he was himself facing seven charges of attempted murder .
Journalists in court in Pretoria are reporting that one of Pistorius ' legal team , Brian Webber , when asked whether the athlete would be testifying , said : "" We have no choice â€ ¦
it 's a question of when . ""
He added it was "" likely "" that Pistorius would be first to give evidence for the defence .
Oscar Pistorius has just left the court .
It is not yet clear whether Pistorius will be the first to give evidence in his defence â€ “ in South African trials
it is convention for the accused to do so .
The defence is asking for more time to prepare its case .
Roux asks to have until Friday morning to consult with witnesses not called by the state , with whom he could not communicate until now .
Nel does not object .
The judge allows the request to adjourn until Friday morning .
"" This is the state 's case , "" says Nel .
That is it for the prosecution case .
It 's the prosecution 's turn to question the witness now .
Gerrie Nel points out that this new top mark on the door did not break it , unlike those lower down , so could have been a weaker hit .
Vermeulen has said that the mark could possibly have been made by Pistorius on his stumps if he were standing very close to the door .
Vermeulen was asked to test the sound of cricket bat versus sound of gunshots .
He says he has not had time .
The witness says he was not asked to investigate a shoe mark on the door ( the defence says this mark also corroborates the claim by Pistorius that he had put on his prosthetic legs before breaking the door down ) .
Roux : "" I put it to you that there are experts that will say that those marks were made by the cricket bat . ""
He says he will call evidence to show the bat also made the third , higher mark .
The evidence about the "" new "" mark at the top of the door , and the rather hesitant replies from the witness , is making this part of the trial quite difficult to follow .
It appears to relate to the question of whether Pistorius was wearing his prosthetic legs when he batted his way through the toilet door .
Vermeulen testified that he thought he was on his stumps .
Pistorius has previously claimed that he was on his stumps when he shot through the door , before returning to the bedroom to put on his prosthetic legs and then breaking down the door with the cricket bat .
Vermeulen concedes that he did not try to match the cricket bat with this apparent new mark .
Vermeulen apparently returned to court last week to examine a new mark on the door .
Vermeulen is surprised that Roux knows about this .
Roux asks why there are no pictures of Vermeulen testing this "" new "" mark on the door .
Vermeulen says he looked at the other marks but could not relate them to the cricket bat that was used to break down the door .
It 's confirmed that Barry Roux , for the defence , has requested that Colonel Gerhard Vermeulen be recalled .
You can see Vermeulen 's earlier video evidence from his 12 March court appearance here : It appears the court is to recall Colonel Gerhard Vermeulen , a forensic investigator who previously gave evidence about the cricket bat used by Pistorius to break down the toilet door following the shooting of Steenkamp .
Journalists in court are reporting that they expect Vermeulen to be the last witness before the prosecution rests its case .
The court has taken a break for lunch .
Here 's what has happened in court so far today :
â€¢ The prosecution has detailed calls made to and from Oscar Pistorius ' phones on the night of Reeva Steenkamp 's death , which showed that after alerting security guards and the ambulance service he rang his friend , his brother and his manager .
An expert witness agreed that a call to Pistorius ' own voicemail had probably been made accidentally .
â€¢ Mobile phone evidence showed that Pistorius made the first call to estate security guards and was then called back by them , contradicting earlier evidence from a guard that he had rung the athlete first .
â€¢ Police warrant officer Adriaan Maritz told the court the police computer system had no record of Pistorius ever reporting a crime or being the victim of one .
Defence lawyer Barry Roux insisted Pistorius had been "" a victim of crime on many occasions "" and pointed out that police responding to calls about the shooting of Steenkamp had come from a nearby house robbery , as both sides tried to paint a picture of Pistorius ' fear ( or otherwise ) of being attacked in his home .
â€¢
The defence has sought to show that the relationship between Pistorius and Steenkamp was a loving one , following Monday 's revelations that Steenkamp has said she was "" scared "" of her boyfriend .
Texts and WhatsApp exchanges were read to the court , and CCTV images of the pair showed them kissing as they shopped for groceries .
Roux said these showed that any arguments were swiftly resolved , adding that of over 1,700 messages , the prosecution had found only four that showed rows between the couple .
â€¢ Steenkamp had offered to cook dinner for Pistorius on Valentine 's day
â€
“
she was killed in the early hours of that morning .
â€¢ There was evidence that Pistorius had been having trouble with an injured shoulder ; the defence suggested it would return to this point .
Court breaks for lunch .
There will be further prosecution evidence after the break .
Roux is questioning the police officer now .
He asks if Maritz relied solely on the police computer records for his evidence .
He says he did .
Roux :
We know that there was a house break - in in 2010 ?
Maritz :
I was not aware of that .
Roux points out that police were coming from another house robbery the night Steenkamp was killed .
Maritz confirms that is correct .
Maritz , under further questioning from Nel , says if Pistorius had been a victim of crime , his name should have been on the police system , "" unless his name was spelt wrong or a mistake was made "" .
Maritz has finished his evidence now .
There was only one ( alleged ) murder on the estate in that period â€ “ Reeva Steenkamp 's .
The court is being shown a picture on the screen with an aerial photo of the Silverlakes area , where Pistorius lived , showing crime hotspots .
Red dots indicate where the most crimes are committed , Maritz says .
Nel : Yellow spots ?
Maritz :
That is the houses that have had problems in the last three years up to 2013.ï » ¿ Nel : Blue ?
Maritz : Armed robberies .
Nel :
Dark blue ?
Maritz :
This is the murder that was reported .
Nel :
The one we are dealing with ?
Maritz :
That is correct .
Nel asks Maritz if Pistorius had ever reported a crime or been the victim of a crime : "" Did you establish that he was ? ""
Maritz says he could n't find anything of that sort on the system .
The next witness is police warrant officer Adriaan Maritz , based at Boschkop police station in the crime information office .
He is giving evidence via an interpreter .
Another short adjournment as the court waits for an interpreter for the next witness .
Nel is going back with Moller over the WhatsApp messages that were raised in court on Monday .
Nel :
Seven days before the accused shot her , she said : "" I ca n't be attacked by outsiders and be attacked by you . ""
Did he respond to her ?
Moller :
The next message is at 10 am by the accused .
She then sent him a message at 10 am , the next message .
Nel :
So the accused never responded .
Moller :
Unless she deleted it .
Nel has no further questions for the witness .
Roux intervenes briefly to ascertain that there were "" a number "" of phone calls between Pistorius and Steenkamp between the WhatsApp "" attack "" message and the exchange the following morning .
The defence cross - examination is over .
Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel resumes his questioning .
We are now on to messages about the night Steenkamp was shot dead .
Roux asks Moller about another exchange a couple of days before Steenkamp was shot .
She tells Pistorius : â€œI know Warren [ Lahoud , an ex - boyfriend ] wanted to have coffee â€
¦
I can see him another day.â€ �
He replies : â€œI have a dentist appointment , maybe go see him and come see me when Iâ€ ™ m done .
"" It would appear the defence is trying to undermine earlier evidence suggesting Pistorius was jealous and controlling .
Steenkamp sent Pistorius a message asking if she could cook for him on Valentine 's day , 14 February : "" Baby , can I cook for you on Thursday . ""
Pistorius replied : "" I 'd love that . ""
She was shot in the early hours of that morning .
Roux is detailing a number of exchanges between Pistorius and Steenkamp in which they call each other by pet names â€ “ "" baba "" , "" boo "" , "" angel "" â€ “ and swap kisses ( "" cross cross "" ) .
Roux says : "" There are lots .
I 'm not going to go on . ""
But he continues to read them out .
He refers to exchanges on 27 January following an argument between Pistorius and Steenkamp .
Roux cites later text from Pistorius : "" good morning angel , i hope u slept well . ""
Roux says these messages show that any arguments were swiftly resolved .
Here 's a shot from the CCTV footage shown in court in which Pistorius and Steenkamp can be seen kissing .
The defence wants to show footage of Pistorius and Steenkamp as evidence of their "" loving relationship "" .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel objects .
But it will be shown .
Roux is discussing messages from Steenkamp and websites she visited showing a love of cars and searches for property .
The cross - examination of mobile phone expert Francois Moller by Pistorius ' lawyer , Barry Roux , continues .
The court is taking another break .
Roux highlights messages from Pistorius to Steenkamp relating to a shoulder injury :
one mentions a trip to the physio , another :
"" I am not going , my shoulder is stuffed . ""
Roux says the evidence of the sore shoulder will be important in relation to what side of the bed Pistorius was sleeping on on the night of the shooting .
Roux is focusing on the large number of text exchanges between Pistorius and Steenkamp that were loving .
( Moller had already stated on Monday that 90 % of them were "" normal conversations and loving conversations "" .
Roux says now : "" I think it 's a bit higher , the percentage . "" )
Roux on the relationship : "" There was a disagreement , an unhappiness , but if you look at the emails it was resolved very quickly . ""
Roux draws attention to , but then says he wo nt deal with , a message about Steenkamp 's supposed drug use , as it is a "" reflection of the deceased not the accused "" .
Again , we heard a little of this in Monday 's WhatsApp evidence : Pistorius wrote to her : "" I know .
It was just when you got back from tropica [ Tropica Island of Treasure , a reality TV show ]
you made it sound like you had only smoked weed once and then last night that came out .
I do n't know how many times you took it or if you took other things or what you did when you were on them . ""
Steenkamp said : "" I 'm sorry if it upset you .
It was n't my intention.""ï » ¿
This relates to evidence heard earlier in the trial , that Oscar Pistorius allegedly fired a gun in a crowded restaurant , and told a friend â€ “ Darren Fresco â€ “ to take the blame because of the "" media hype "" surrounding him .
On Monday the court heard about a WhatsApp message sent by Pistorius to Steenkamp in which he apparently referred to the incident : ï»¿""Angel please do n't say a thing to any one , Darren told everyone it was his fault â€
¦
I ca n't afford for that to come out .
The guys promised not to say a thing . ""
Moller concedes he can not tell who actually made the calls , only communication between two numbers , not that a "" specific person was involved in that communication "" .
Roux suggests Pistorius ' call to voicemail could have been accidental .
Moller agrees it was probably "" not intentional "" â€ “ the buttons are close together .
The court has previously heard from a security guard who claimed he made the first call to Pistorius and was told everything was OK .
Moller 's evidence appears to contradict this .
Roux has now turned to calls made â€ “ by Pistorius and his neighbours â€ “ to estate security on the night of the shooting .
Moller says his analysis shows Pistorius made a call to security at 3.21am .
Security called back at 3.22am .
"" The first call was made by Mr Pistorius â€
¦
It was answered , it lasted for nine seconds , "" Moller says .
Barry Roux , Pistorius ' lawyer , says the internet connection on the phone(s ) after the shooting does not mean it was "" human intervention "" .
Roux :
If an application is not closed , it will carry on running .
Moller :
That is correct .
Roux :
It would be emails coming in , updates â€ ¦ Moller :
That is correct , it can be automatic updates , emails coming in or going out .
Roux :
So it does not mean it is human intervention there ?
Moller :
That is correct .
Court is taking a ten - minute break .
Moller has now moved to the period after the shooting : the first voice call from Pistorius ' phone was to Johan Stander , estate manager , lasting 24 seconds .
At 03.20am , Pistorius rang the ambulance service , in a call lasting 66 secs .
He later made another call to the security office of the estate .
At 3.21am Pistorius rang his own voicemail .
At 3.22am there was an incoming voice call â€ “ estate security calling him back .
At 3.55am Pistorius called his friend Justin Divaris for 123 seconds .
At 4.01am he called Heinrich Pistorius ( his brother , usually known as Carl ) and then his manager .
Moller : [ Then ] three more calls .
There was then an incoming voice call from that number to the accused 's number and lasted for 49 seconds.ï » ¿ Nel : We then have GPRS connections .
Moller :
Yes â€ ¦ The phone was in that area until about 8 am that morning and there after it left .
We 've now moved on to analysis of Pistorius ' two phones , between 17.30 and midnight on 13 February â€ “
no voice calls from first phone , only five GPRS ( internet ) connections .
Pistorius phoned Steenkamp on 13 February ( the day before her death ) at 1.02pm .
The call lasted for 241 seconds .
The chart shows there were five phone calls between the pair that afternoon .
The witness is discussing an iPhone 5 registered to Pistorius .
The prosecution is interested in "" movement and communication "" of phones belonging to Pistorius and Steenkamp .
The court is being show a "" communication analysis chart "" from Steenkamp 's phone .
Steenkamp was killed in the early hours of 14 February 2013 .
Mobile phone expert Francois Moller is giving further evidence now .
The court hearing is due to start shortly , with the prosecution expected to continue the evidence of Francois Moller , the police mobile phone expert , which could mean more details of text exchanges between Pistorius and Steenkamp .
Welcome to live coverage of the trial of Oscar Pistorius , who is accused of the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine 's day last year .
The prosecution is coming towards the end of its case but is expected to call more witnesses today .
Pistorius is pleading not guilty to the murder charge , saying he thought he was shooting at an intruder .
Yesterday 's report from David Smith , who has been in court in Pretoria throughout the trial , is here .
Monday 's evidence centred around messages sent to and from Steenkamp 's phone : some 35,654 pages ' worth of messages were retrieved .
A number showed Whatsapp exchanges between Steenkamp and Pistorius .
"" You have picked on me excessively â€ ¦
I do everything to make you happy and you do everything to throw tantrums , "" said a WhatsApp message sent by Steenkamp to Pistorius on 27 January 2013 .
"" I 'm scared of you sometimes and how you snap at me and of how you will react to me . ""
You make me happy 90 % of the time
and I think we are amazing together
â€
¦
but I am not some other bitch
â€ ¦ trying to kill your vibe
â€
¦
I 'm the girl who fell in love with you
but I 'm also the girl who gets side - stepped when you are in a shit mood
â€
¦ I get snapped at and told my accent and voices are annoying . ""
Police mobile phone expert Francois Moller said : "" Ninety percent [ of all the messages ] were normal conversations and loving conversations . ""
The court also heard a neighbour of Pistorius testify that she heard gunshots , the "" terrified , terrified "" screams of a woman and then a second set of gunshots on the night of the shooting .
Anette Stipp 's testimony matched some of the evidence given by other witnesses earlier in the trial .
You can see all of David 's tweets from Monday 's hearing here and follow his tweets from the courtroom today here ."
2014-03-26,"Oscar Pistorius admitted he is having a "" tough time "" on Tuesday as prosecutors closed their murder case against him , bringing closer the defining moment when he must account for his actions in court .
Speaking publicly for the first time since his trial got under way amid intense worldwide interest , the Paralympian , asked by the Guardian to reflect on the state 's case , paused and replied softly : "" We 've got a lot of stuff ahead of us . ""
Pistorius is accused of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp at his luxury home in Pretoria , South Africa , on Valentine 's day last year .
He insists that it was an accident after he mistook her for an intruder .
Prosecutors will not set out their final argument until the end of the trial , but the thread running through their case was that Pistorius and Steenkamp argued and that several neighbours heard terrified screams and gunshots .
They have sought to portray the athlete as fanatical about guns and reckless in using them . ""
May it please the court , my lady , this is the state 's case , "" the lead prosecutor Gerrie Nel told the court , having called 20 witnesses from an original list of 107 .
The defence then requested an adjournment but it remains uncertain whether the 27-year - old will be first to testify when the trial resumes on Friday .
Asked by journalists whether he was prepared , a tired - looking Pistorius replied : "" It 's a tough time . ""
Legal experts say it is not compulsory for the accused to testify first , but generally preferable as a show of confidence and to ensure he is not contradicted .
Among Pistorius 's defence team , Barry Roux declined to comment and Brian Webber said it was "" likely "" he would be called on Friday , but Kenny Oldwadge said : "" We 'll see about that . ""
A member of the Pistorius family insisted : "" He 's ready .
You do n't have to be a legal expert to see where this is going . ""
In an unusually detailed bail application statement last year , Pistorius argued that he shot four times through a locked toilet door after hearing a noise and thinking there was burglar .
On Monday the court heard evidence from WhatsApp message records that Steenkamp was sometimes scared of her boyfriend .
But on Tuesday Roux argued that only four conversations were argumentative out of more than 1,700 messages between the pair .
More than 90 % were warm and loving , he said .
"" There was a disagreement , unhappiness , but if you look at the messages , it was resolved very quickly , "" he told the court .
Roux drew attention to messages in which the couple used pet names such as "" angel "" and "" baba "" , traded compliments and said they missed each other .
In one WhatsApp message , Steenkamp wrote to Pistorius : "" I 'm always on your side .
I 'm pro you and your career but most pro our relationship . ""
In another , on 9 January , she wrote : "" You are a very special person .
You deserve to be looked after . ""
Roux also noted an exchange from 19 January 2013 in which Steenkamp sent Pistorius a photo of herself in a hoodie and blowing a kiss , followed by the message : "" You like it ? ""
"" I love it , "" Pistorius replied .
"" So warm , "" Steenkamp responded .
A month later the model and law graduate asked : "" Can I cook for you on Thursday ? ""
â€ “ a reference to Valentine 's Day , which is when she died .
On 13 February , Steenkamp told Pistorius : "" You are an amazing person with so many blessings and you are more than cared for . ""
The athlete told her : "" Stay tonight if you like . ""
Nel countered , however , that the only messages of significant length recovered from the couple 's phones were Steenkamp 's anguished pleas after she felt mistreated .
Francois Moller , a police technology expert , gave details of several calls made from Pistorius 's phone in quick succession after the shooting .
The first was at 3.19am on 14 February to a manager at his residential estate in Pretoria .
He also called an ambulance and his estate security , and there were calls to a friend , to Pistorius 's brother Carl and to Peet van Zyl , his longtime manager .
Police analysis showed that a five - minute internet connection was made on Pistorius 's phone from 1.48am on 14 February , little more than an hour before he killed Steenkamp , when he claims the couple were asleep .
Moller did not specify whether the connection was manual or automatic .
Roux showed colour CCTV footage showing the couple flirting with each other while buying groceries 10 days before her death .
At one point Pistorius was seen to lean over and kiss Steenkamp .
The court heard that just 11 crime incidents were reported in Pistorius 's gated community , the Silver Woods estate , in three years .
Hendrick Maritz , a police warrant officer , said he could find no record of Pistorius having reported being a victim of crime , contrary to claims the athlete made at last year 's bail hearing .
If found guilty , Pistorius could face life imprisonment ."
2014-03-27,"Sitting day after day in the dock , close to the bullet - pierced wooden door that haunts his murder trial , Oscar Pistorius has been reading a book entitled Breakthrough Prayer by the US pastor Jim Cymbala .
One of the sentences underlined by the accused , the first double amputee to compete in the Olympics , reads : "" He was blessed by God in all he did . ""
The fallen hero 's faith will be crucial to his mental and emotional state when he is asked to explain to a packed courtroom in Pretoria and TV viewers
round the world , why 13 months ago he fired repeatedly into a locked toilet cubicle knowing that there was a human being inside .
Pistorius will be put on the spot , possibly as early as Friday , to be cross - examined on the account he gave when applying for bail last year , that he acted in self - defence after hearing what he thought was an intruder , only to discover with horror that he had killed his 29-year - old girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp . ""
With his emotional state and the whole world looking at him , he could very well break down , "" said William Booth , a lawyer and commentator .
"" The media 's watching him and everyone 's talking about him .
How does a person get through that ?
It 's got to be massively difficult for anyone . ""
This is not a whodunnit but a whydunnit , with only one eyewitness : Pistorius himself .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel acknowledged on the first day of the trial that all of the evidence is necessarily circumstantial .
The 27-year - old 's character will therefore be under the microscope .
A convincing performance on the witness stand could spell the difference between life in jail or a chance to resurrect his sporting career .
When his defence opens on Friday , these are the major questions he will have to answer :
Irrespective of who was in the toilet , why did Pistorius shoot without warning ?
This is the central question of intent .
Firearms trainer and salesman Sean Rens testified that Pistorius passed a competency test , showing that he was fully aware of the lawful and unlawful use of potentially lethal force against intruders .
Pistorius may struggle to persuade the judge that he had good reason to believe his life was in danger when he shot four times through a locked door in the early hours of Valentine 's day last year .
There is a wider context .
Violent crime , and the fear of it , is unusually high in South Africa .
Pistorius claimed he had received death threats and been a victim of violence and of burglaries before , that was why he kept a 9 mm pistol under his bed .
His disability could come into play .
The defence may seek to highlight that Pistorius felt extremely vulnerable when he heard a noise because he was on his stumps .
A local police officer , however , testified that crime was rare on Pistorius 's estate and that the Paralympian had never reported an incident .
Margie Orford , a South African crime writer , said : "" For me the key thing that happened last week was when the gun salesman said he knew you ca n't shoot at someone unless you know he 's coming at you .
This is the crux of the prosecution 's case .
Whoever was behind that door , he knew he was committing murder .
All the rest is sound and fury signifying nothing . ""
Was Pistorius 's relationship with Steekamp in trouble and potentially abusive ?
The prosecution did not explicity state a motive for premeditated murder , but it did present evidence of turbulence in Pistorius 's four - month relationship with Steenkamp .
WhatsApp messages between them appeared to show Pistorius jealous , possessive and prone to fits of rage .
Steenkamp told him : "" I 'm scared of you sometimes and how you snap at me .
You do everything to throw tantrums .
I am certainly very unhappy and sad . ""
The defence claimed that more than 90 % of the messages retrieved were caring and compassionate .
None indicated that Pistorius was physically violent towards her .
He is likely to tell the court that he was in love with Steenkamp .
Did the couple argue before the shooting ?
Pistorius claimed in his bail application that the couple were in his bedroom by 10 pm .
Evidence from the pathologist Gert Saayman , however , suggested that the type and amount of food found in Steenkamp 's stomach during the autopsy indicated that she had ingested it no more than two hours prior to her death .
This implies that she was awake and eating at 1 am .
A neighbour also claimed she awoke and heard voices , though she could not discern what was being said .
Why did neighbours hear screams ?
Four neighbours in Pistorius 's gated community testified that they heard a woman 's "" blood curdling "" , "" petrified "" or "" terrified "" screams , dying away after the final gunshot , along with a man 's voice .
This begs the question as to why Pistorius continued firing after the first shot , since such screams were hardly likely to come from a typical burglar .
The neighbours appear to be respectable professionals with nothing to gain from misleading the judge , but the defence counsel , Barry Roux , will point to sound tests carried out at the estate earlier this year to argue that what they actually heard was Pistorius crying for help .
He will contend that the otherwise masculine sportstman screams like a woman when he is anxious .
Roux has also asserted that some of the perceived gunshots were in fact the sound of Pistorius breaking down the door with a cricket bat .
What happened when Steenkamp was shot ?
Chris Mangena , a police ballistics expert , testified that Steenkamp was standing inside the toilet cubicle and facing the closed door when she was hit by the first bullet , a particularly lethal form of ammunition that opens up like a talon when it makes contact with flesh .
Mangena said Steenkamp was shot in the right hip and was cowering when she was hit in the head .
The pathologist earlier testified that it would have been abnormal for Steenkamp not to scream when struck by the initial shots , so the state is likely to press Pistorius hard on whether he heard any screams between the gunshots , as this would demonstrate he knew who was behind the door .
The defence , however , disputed Mangena 's timeline and will argue that Steenkamp would not have had time to scream .
Neighbours have also claimed that lights were seen on in Pistorius 's house when they heard a set of bangs , contradicting his assertion that everything was dark .
Was Pistorius wearing his prosthetic limbs when he tried to break down the door with a cricket bat ?
Pistorius 's lower legs were amputated when he was a baby , and his disability is woven into the narrative of the trial .
Johannes Vermeulen , a forensic analyst , demonstrated the angle at which a cricket bat was most likely swung at the toilet door , producing marks consistent with Pistorius not wearing the prostheses that earned him the nickname Blade Runner .
This challenges Pistorius 's statement that he put on his prostheses after the shooting , tried to kick the toilet door open and then bashed it with a cricket bat .
The defence cast doubt on the reliabilty of Vermeulen 's analysis and suggested new marks had appeared on the door while in police possession .
Was there an attempted cover - up ?
Pieter Baba , a security guard on Pistorius 's housing estate , said he called the athlete after neighbours reported gunshots and was told : "" Security , everything is fine . ""
The defence , however , pointed to phone records they said showed Pistorius had made the first call .
It received another boost when a doctor , Johan Stipp , who raced to the scene , was immediately told by Pistorius : "" I shot her .
I thought she was a burglar
and I shot her .
""
The doctor also testified that Pistorius appeared sincere and prayed to God to save her .
Is Pistorius reckless with guns and a liar ?
The court has heard evidence in relation to separate firearms charges .
Witnesses described how Pistorius fired a gun through the open sunroof of a moving car after clashing with a police officer , and how he accidentally let off a firearm in a busy restaurant and then asked a friend to take the blame .
A WhatsApp message from Pistorius to Steenkamp appeared to back up the latter story .
Such evidence has helped to paint a picture of a man who acts before he thinks , shows flashes of temper and behaves irresponsibly with guns .
In the absence of eyewitnesses , judge Thokozile Masipa 's assessment of Pistorius 's character may prove important to the central murder charge ."
2014-03-27,"When Oscar Pistorius undergoes the ordeal of cross - examination at his murder trial , he will at least have the courtroom support of those who have never doubted him : his family .
The double amputee athlete 's mother Sheila died when he was 15 , and his estranged father , Henke , has been conspicuously absent from the trial , but Pistorius 's siblings , aunts , uncles and cousins have been out in force to support him .
Among them is the Paralympian 's uncle , Arnold Pistorius , the de facto family spokesman who takes careful notes , and his sister , Aimee , who when court adjourns is often first to join the distraught Pistorius in the dock with comforting words and hugs .
Their unwavering belief in him and his explanation is clear , and evidently a great solace to him .
Every day , judge Thokozile Masipa sees the Pistoriuses sitting on the right of the front row of the public gallery , while the late Reeva Steenkamp 's smaller band of family members and friends sits on the left .
Steenkamp 's mother , June , was present on the first day the missed most of the trial , but has returned in recent days .
Her husband , Barry , suffered a stroke recently and has stayed at home .
The Steenkamp entourage – who wear stickers showing her face – often includes other relatives , close friends Desi , Gina and Kim Myers , and members of the African National Congress Women 's League , who view the case as emblematic of South Africa 's high rate of domestic violence .
Steenkamp 's parents , now running a pub outside Port Elizabeth , are less well off than Arnold , a businessman whose mansion has become the athlete 's refuge since 14 February 2013 .
Yet the tragedy brings the two families to the same court bench every day , and the Pistoriuses have attempted to bridge the desperately awkward divide .
Recently , Aimee was seen walking over to June , speaking to her for several minutes and touching hands .
A day later , Arnold also made an approach and offered consoling words .
On another occasion a letter from Aimee was passed along the row to June .
There has also been a hint of mutual acknowledgement between Pistorius and June , who criticised him for ignoring her on the first day .
The Pistoriuses are also increasingly at ease with the media sitting on the row immediately behind .
Arnold chats about diverse subjects including the weather , the poaching of rhinos ( he owns some ) , China 's policy on land clearance for building projects and , "" off the record "" , how the trial is going .
He has passed bottles of water to a pregnant journalist , while Aimee gave food to one who was feeling faint and offered advice on where to shop healthily .
The most recent tweet on Aimee 's account is a picture showing part of a Lao Tzu quote : "" Being deeply loved gives you strength ; loving deeply gives you courage "" ."
2014-03-28,"I 'm wrapping up this live blog now .
You can read David Smith 's report from the Pretoria court here .
A quick recap : â€¢ The trial of Oscar Pistorius for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp has been adjourned after one of the judge 's assessors â€ “ without whom the court can not proceed â€ “ fell ill .
â€¢
The defence will now open its case on 7 April .
â€¢ Pistorius might not take the stand first when the trial resumes , as the defence has been given permission to call an independent pathologist first if it chooses .
My colleague David Smith has filed from Pretoria on the postponement of the trial : The decision marked an abrupt end to days of media hype , dashing hopes that Pistorius was about to take the witness stand and testify about his fatal shooting of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentineâ€ ™ s day last year .
If this had gone ahead , TV viewers would not have been able to see 27-year - oldâ€ ™ s face but would have heard him via audio feed .
The disappointment was evident among the Paralympianâ€ ™ s family , who had turned out in force to hear him .
â€œHe was all geared up , â€ � one said .
Interestingly , it looks as if Pistorius might not be first up to give evidence when his defence opens on 7 April : When the Pistorius trial resumes on 7 April , it looks set to clash with another high - profile murder case â€ “ that of Shrien Dewani , accused of orchestrating the killing of his wife Anni while on honeymoon in Cape Town in November 2010 .
Dewani , having lost a legal battle in the UK to avoid deportation to South Africa , is due to travel to Cape Town on 7 April and to appear in court there on 8 April .
Dewani denies any involvement in the killing of his new wife , and two men have already been jailed over the murder .
They testified that Dewani had ordered the hit .
We have a bit more information on the court assessors , one of whom has been taken ill , prompting the adjournment of the trial until 7 April .
At the start of the trial , at the beginning of March , the judge , Thokozile Masipa , swore in two assessors : Janet Henzen - Du - Toit ( believed to be the person in hospital today ) and Themba Mazibuko .
Media Club South Africa has this helpful FAQ on the role of the assessors : ï»¿For the Pistorius trial , Judge Masipa appointed Janet Henzen - du Toit and Themba Mazibuko as her assessors .
They are there to help her make a decision .
The assessors will sit with Judge Masipa during the proceedings and listen to all the evidence presented to the judge .
At the end of the case they will present their opinions to Judge Masipa .
However , she is allowed to override them .
On the Legal Brief website , Professor Annette van der Merwe , a criminal procedure law expert at the University of Pretoria , said the two assessors could overrule the judge when it comes to a verdict on the facts in a majority finding .
This means that if the two assessors were to rule in favour of murder , or the judge and one assessor were to rule so , that verdict would be the accepted one .
The same would apply if two of them were to rule in favour of an acquittal .
Members of the Pistorius family were in court again today for the ( brief ) hearing â€ “ as David Smith reports , they have been a constant presence on the bench behind the athlete during his trial : ï»¿His estranged father , Henke , has been conspicuously absent from the trial , but Pistorius 's siblings , aunts , uncles and cousins have been out in force to support him .
Among them is the Paralympian 's uncle , Arnold Pistorius , the de facto family spokesman who takes careful notes , and his sister , Aimee , who when court adjourns is often first to join the distraught Pistorius in the dock with comforting words and hugs .
Their unwavering belief in him and his explanation is clear , and evidently a great solace to him .
Reeva Steenkamp 's mother , June , has been present for some of the trial .
Her husband , Barry , suffered a stroke recently and has stayed at home .
The tragedy brings the two families to the same court bench every day , and the Pistoriuses have attempted to bridge the desperately awkward divide .
Recently , Aimee was seen walking over to June , speaking to her for several minutes and touching hands .
A day later , Arnold also made an approach and offered consoling words .
On another occasion a letter from Aimee was passed along the row to June .
There has also been a hint of mutual acknowledgement between Pistorius and June , who criticised him for ignoring her on the first day .
Sky News ' Martin Brunt reports that the court assessor involved is Janette Henzen du Toit , who is apparently in hospital .
Pistorius ' chief lawyer , Barry Roux , is n't speaking to reporters as he leaves the court following the unexpected adjournment .
The court assessors â€ “ one of whom is ill , forcing a postponement of the trial â€ “ are legal experts appointed by Judge Thokozile Masipa to assist in the trial .
There is no jury .
As Masipa said today , without both assessors the court is not "" properly constituted "" , and so the trial can not proceed .
This was supposed to be the recess week but all sides have agreed to come back to court on that date .
One of the court assessors is ill and today 's proceedings have been postponed .
Reporters in Pretoria say the courtroom is packed in anticipation of Pistorius giving evidence today
â€ “
we still do n't know that he will , although most expect him to be the first witness for the defence when it opens today .
It 's also expected that when Pistorius does give his testimony , audio will be broadcast but the cameras in the court will not be able to show him .
This was decided by a different judge in a ruling in February : Expert witnesses ' testimony can be shown but not that of Pistorius or his witnesses .
Restrictions could be placed on other witness testimony if they object to being shown on TV â€ ¦
The court would then consider showing such testimonies from behind the witness or obscuring their face .
No parts of confidential discussions between Pistorius and his lawyers could be broadcast in any way.ï » ¿
The Guardian 's David Smith , who is covering the case from Pretoria , has also assessed the key questions the defence will have to answer .
You can read it in full here .
This is not a whodunnit but a whydunnit , with only one eyewitness : Pistorius himself .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel acknowledged on the first day of the trial that all of the evidence is necessarily circumstantial .
The 27-year - old 's character will therefore be under the microscope .
A convincing performance on the witness stand could spell the difference between life in jail or a chance to resurrect his sporting career.ï » ¿ Pistorius has arrived in court .
Welcome to live coverage of day 16 of the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp .
Today the defence will open its case , and Pistorius is expected to be the first witness to give evidence , although this has n't yet been confirmed .
Here is a quick recap of the latest developments : â€¢ On Tuesday the state concluded its case .
Prosecutors will not set out their final argument until the end of the trial , but their case has focused on evidence from text and WhatsApp exchanges showing Pistorius and Steenkamp argued and testimony that several neighbours heard terrified screams and gunshots .
They have sought to portray the athlete as fanatical about guns and reckless in using them .
â€¢
The defence asked for a two - day adjournment to prepare its witnesses .
Usually the accused would be the first to testify in his own defence but Pistorius 's defence team has remained cautious :
Brian Webber said it was "" likely "" he would be called on Friday , but Kenny Oldwadge said : "" We 'll see about that . ""
â€¢
The defence is also expected to call Hilton Botha , the original investigating officer who was removed from the case after it emerged he was facing attempted murder charges .
Pistorius ' defence team has previously alleged that he contaminated the scene of the shooting .
You can read about Tuesday 's court hearing as it happened in our previous live blog here .
Our reporter David Smith is once again in court and you can read all his tweets here .
In the two - day breather , journalists who have been attending the hearings have been putting together the questions they expect Pistorius to face â€ “ from his own team and the prosecution â€ “ when he does take the stand .
The Globe and Mail focuses on the screams that neighbours testified to hearing from the Pistorius house on the night of the shooting :
Four neighbours have testified they heard a womanâ€ ™ s screams , silenced by the final gunshots .
If this testimony is upheld , it alone could be enough to convict Mr Pistorius of murder , since it implies that he continued shooting after he knew who was behind the door .
The defence will argue that the "" womanâ€ ™ s screamsâ€ � were actually uttered by Mr Pistorius as he screamed for help .
It will also argue that the â€œgunshotsâ€ � were the noise of a cricket bat on the door as Mr Pistorius battered it down to try to save Ms Steenkampâ€ ™ s
life.ï » ¿ Eyewitness News poses 10 questions it says Pistorius will be challenged over , particularly the athlete 's claim that he did not realise Steenkamp had got out of bed to go to the bathroom : Pistorius has provided no indication that he even attempted to establish the whereabouts of Steenkamp before arming himself and approaching the perceived threat .
Pistorius says in the bail application that he fired the shots and then called to Steenkamp to call the police , but she did not respond .
Pistorius then retreated to the bed , and once he got there â€ “ still in pitch darkness â€ “
â€œit dawned upon himâ€ � that Reeva could have been in the toilet .
Was it the lack of response that triggered this belief that she was not in the bedroom ?
The BBC 's Andrew Harding has a slightly different take on the evidence heard so far : Perhaps we 've been distracted by all the talk of restaurant gunfire , screams , and angry texts .
It 's been made clear to me that the prosecution believes their case is watertight even if we accept Pistorius ' own version of events .
In other words â€ “ if someone fires four shots through a locked door then he obviously intended to kill someone , and thus should be convicted of murder ( pre - meditated or otherwise ) .
A reasonable man would and should have checked.ï » ¿"
2014-03-28,"The cameras were rolling , the public gallery was full and Oscar Pistorius was bracing himself for the biggest moment of his blockbuster trial .
Then came the mother of all anticlimaxes .
"" One of my assessors is not well , so this court is not properly constituted , "" said the judge , Thokozile Masipa , on Friday .
"" I suggest that we postpone this matter until 7 April . ""
Masipa has two assessors – Janet Henzen - Du Toit , who has been taken ill , and Themba Mazibuko – who sit on either side of her in the courtroom at all times and will help her arrive at a final verdict .
She has occasionally consulted them during proceedings
but they have not spoken publicly .
Assessors are typically magistrates or retired magistrates ; the jury system was abolished in South Africa in the 1960s .
The prosecutor Gerrie Nel and defence counsel Barry Roux agreed to the postponement , saying they would make arrangements to resume on 7 April in what had originally been planned as a week in recess .
The decision marked an abrupt end to days of media hype , with Pistorius about to take the witness stand and testify about the fatal shooting of his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , on Valentine 's Day last year .
If proceedings had gone ahead , TV viewers would not have been able to see the 27-year - old 's face , but would have heard him speak .
The disappointment was evident among the Paralympian 's family , who had turned out in force to hear him . ""
He was all geared up , "" one said .
The defence was due to begin its case on Friday after 15 days of prosecution - led testimony .
Several neighbours testified to hearing a woman 's terrified screams before gunshots , challenging Pistorius 's claim that he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder hiding in the toilet cubicle in the middle of the night .
The trial has fascinated South Africa and people around the world who saw Pistorius – dubbed the "" blade runner "" because of his prosthetic limbs – as a symbol of triumph against the odds .
His lower legs were amputated as a baby , but he went on to achieve celebrity as the "" fastest man on no legs "" , winning gold medals at both the Beijing and London Paralympics .
He became the first amputee to run at an Olympics when he reached the 400 m semi - finals in London in 2012 .
The case was originally scheduled to run for three weeks until last Friday , but is now expected to go on until at least mid - May ."
2014-04-06,"Athlete Oscar Pistorius will be back in the glare of the world 's media when his murder trial resumes on Monday but , in an unorthodox legal move , he will not be the first witness for his own defence .
Instead he is expected to follow Prof Jan Botha , a pathologist , on the stand at the high court in Pretoria , where proceedings were suspended for a week due to the illness of a judge 's assistant .
Pistorius shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp , a law graduate and model , who was in a locked toilet cubicle at his home on Valentine 's Day last year .
The 27-year - old has said he mistook her for an intruder and acted to protect them both .
His performance under cross - examination is likely to be pivotal ‚ but the millions following the trial on radio , television and on Twitter will have to wait a little longer .
Brian Webber , one of Pistorius 's lawyers , told Agence France - Presse : "" We do n't have a choice .
The pathologist has personal reasons for why he has to take the stand first . ""
The delay might have afforded a pause in media coverage , but Webber said it had given those working on the case little respite . ""
If you think it 's been a week off , then good luck for you . ""
Botha , the chief pathologist in Free State province , did not take part in the postmortem on 29-year - old Steenkamp but is likely to raise questions over the evidence of the state pathologist Prof Gert Saayman .
This may include challenging the suggestion that Steenkamp probably last ate at about 1 am on the night she died , which appears at odds with Pistorius 's claim that they retired to his bedroom at 10 pm .
The defence witness list also includes a neighbour who reportedly lives significantly closer to the athlete than those on the prosecution side who testified that they heard a woman 's terrified screams .
The neighbour is likely to support defence counsel Barry Roux 's claim that the screams came from Pistorius himself ‚ thus neutralising a central tenet of the prosecution case .
Roux is expected to present the results of his own sound tests on the estate .
Pistorius has hired forensic experts including a US animation firm that will depict the scene of the killing using computer - generated 3D images .
The defence is also likely to pick apart the investigation by the police detective Hilton Botha .
Known as the Blade Runner because of his prosthetic limbs , Pistorius is the first amputee to have run in the Olympics .
On Sunday , South Africa 's City Press newspaper suggested that the defence would seek to draw attention to his disability as a factor in why he opened fire .
Dr Brian Watermeyer , a clinical psychologist and disability rights activist , told the paper that the rights of disabled people were violated daily and it was therefore not unreasonable for them to perceive the world as "" potentially dangerous and potentially hostile "" .
South Africa has "" spent quite a lot of energy thinking about racial inequality and about gender inequality , but as a society we have n't started thinking about disability prejudices at all "" , Watermeyer said .
The trial is now scheduled to run to at least mid - May ."
2014-04-07,
2014-04-07,"On Valentine ’s day last year Oscar Pistorius fired four fatal shots at close range through a locked bathroom door , thinking he was hitting an intruder – or so he wants the judge and the world to believe .
Had he killed a black man , would it be an issue ?
I do n't think so .
I believe there would n’t have been a trial .
Instead , he would have been hailed as a hero : “
Here is a man who did good by shooting to kill a black thief !
”
Everyone would have understood and accepted that crime has reached intolerable levels in our society .
The perpetrators are often black men who are unemployed and poor .
And they deserve to be shot down in cold blood for disturbing the peace of suburban life ?
Many white South Africans live in fear of being attacked by black criminals .
Much as they may build sky high walls , they must double that with high - calibre guns in case black security men at the gate allow intruders to slip through .
You can not trust a black man .
White paranoia has driven some white men to shoot first and ask questions later .
We all know and accept it is mostly black men who are robbers and thieves who prey on hard - working white families .
This is the story of our lives .
We know that Pistorius made a terrible mistake .
As a white male you do not kill a white woman , especially the one you profess to love .
Your role and responsibility is to protect and defend her against black men .
But if you happen to have killed her , for whatever reason , you must pin the blame on an intruder .
It is acceptable for white men to shoot and kill black men to protect their property and beloved families .
But for those of us who are black men it is painful to see how our lives have become so cheap .
We get killed for our cellphones or for driving expensive cars .
We are proportionately more likely to be victims of crime ourselves , yet we are condemned for being the source of white insecurity and fear in this beautiful land .
The black man is always a suspect , a target .
In a country where the majority of the population is black , we should be concerned about how the business of justice is conducted .
We should be concerned that Pistorius ' defence lies on this very fact – that it 's fine to pump an intruder full of bullets .
What is another dead black man ?
Something in the soul of this nation dies – has died – because of the emotionless way we brush off these killings .
If Pistorius had shot a black man who had entered his luxury home this man would , even in death , have been tried and condemned for being a robber and a thief in his motherland .
Nobody would have cared about the circumstances that led him to prey on people at night .
Nobody would have asked whether he had been forced by inequality , poverty , unemployment or envy .
As Alan Paton said Cry , the Beloved Country , “ it is fear that rules the country
” , especially in the mind of some white men .
They will carry guns to protect themselves and their families against black thugs .
If not , they will lock themselves up behind high walls with electrical fences .
And if they kill black men who try to steal , it is understandable .

After its appearance Sandile Memela wrote an apology to any South Africans he had offended : An apology to my fellow countrymen"
2014-04-07,"With the hearing over for the day , it 's time for a closing summary .
This will be very similar to the lunchtime summary , as we only had about 45 minutes of evidence in the afternoon :
• Oscar Pistorius has taken to the witness stand to begin giving evidence in his murder trial .
He began with a tearful , broken - voiced apology to the family and friends of Reeva Steenkamp , his girlfriend who he shot in February last year , believing –
he says –
she was an intruder .
•
Pistorius said there is "" not a moment "" when he does not think about her family , and prays for them daily .
He added : "" I 've tried to put my words on paper many times to write to you but no words would ever suffice "" • Pistorius said he had taken anti - depressants and sleeping pills since the shooting , often waking with "" terrible nightmares "" in which he dreamed he could smell blood .
He said he often calls his sister to sit with him during the night .
On one occasion he climbed into a cupboard to call her .
•
He said his religious faith was the only thing to sustain him over the past year : "" There have been times when I 've just been struggling a lot .
My God is a God of refuge . ""
• Pistorius spoke at length about his fear about , and experience of , crime .
He said his his mother was worried about intruders and kept a pistol under her pillow
•
Pistorius said a speedboat accident in 2009 which almost killed him left him fearful and withdrawn .
•
Earlier , the first defence witness was a pathologist , Prof Jan Botha , who questioned prosecution evidence that Steenkamp must have eaten about two hours before her death at 3 am , something which runs counter to Pistorius 's statement that they went to bed at 10 pm .
•
Botha was questioned aggressively and at length by the prosecution counsel , Gerrie Nel , giving a taste of the likely cross - examination Pistorius will face .
•
While this evidence was heard , including details of Steenkamp 's injuries and photos of wounds and blood , Pistorius spent much of the time with his hands over his face , also retching .
Pistorius says he is exhausted , and did not sleep last night .
Roux , his counsel , asks if the court can thus be adjourned for the day , early .
Nel , for the prosecution , agrees , so long as it is "" not a daily occurrence "" .
The judge , Thokozile Masipa , adjourns the case until 9.30am tomorrow local time ( 8.30am BST ) Pistorius is now being asked about his religious faith , which he describes as important .
He says his mother was devout : It does n't matter what comes in life , you can always turn to the Lord .
He describes meeting Steenkamp as "" a blessing "" , as she shared his faith , and they prayed regularly together .
His says faith is perhaps the only thing to get him through the last year : There have been times when I 've just been struggling a lot .
My god is a god of refuge .
Pistorius is now being asked about his dogs , specifically an American pitbull he describes as placid and friendly , but bought as a guard dog .
Pistorius explains that at the time of the shooting there was work taking place on his house ahead of a planned sale , as he had put an offer on a house in Johannesburg to be closer to Steenkamp .
He says : I was bowled over by how much I felt for her .
This increased his worries about crime , he says .
The questioning is clearly laying the groundwork for the defence that Pistorius genuinely believed Steenkamp was an intruder when he shot her , which the prosecution disputes .
Pistorius 's voice is more steady after the lunch break .
He still sounds nervous , but his voice is not breaking as he discusses more general issues .
Pistorius says he was so worried about crime he warned his brother to not drive his new Volkwagen Golf GTi to Pretoria as so many of these vehicles were targeted by robbers during hijackings .
As a reminder , my colleague David Smith is live tweeting from the courtroom in Pretoria .
Pistorius says he has never been back to the Silver Woods estate , where Steenkamp died , since the night of the shooting .
He moved there in 2008 , and there was regular crime connected to continued building work on the estate , he says , including a break - in when a ladder was used to gain access to a home and a housekeeper being tied up by robbers .
Pistorius is now recounting an incident in which he was verbally abused and then attacked at a party , suffering a head injury and a black eye .
Police intervened but Pistorius chose to keep the matter out of the media , thinking the attackers mainly wanted publicity .
Pistorius also recounts having a gun fired at his car as he drove , and on another occasion being followed by a car as he headed home .
Many people knew where he lived , he said , in part due to media focus on his life .
Separately , Pistorius said , he intervened as a woman was being assaulted by two drunk men in a parking lot .
The month before Steenkamp 's death , he says , in January 2013 he saw people smashing the windows of a taxi before dragging someone out to beat him with rocks .
Pistorius said he pointed his gun at the attackers to stop the incident .
Pistorius is asked about his exposure to crime , saying his parents suffered a number of break - ins , including when his father 's house was "" ranscked "" and a safe was pulled out of a wall by a vehicle .
He said : We got back from a holiday and basically what was n't taken was destroyed .
His father and other family members had been robbed at gunpoint , he says , while his own house was broken into in 2005 when he was competing in Manchester .
He is now being asked about alcohol consumption .
Pistorius says he only drinks for two short periods of the year : around Christmas , before his annual training regime starts , and during a season break late in the year .
He can occasionally get drunk then , he says .
He does not take drugs , Pistorius says , apart from smoking cannabis once with a friend once when his mother died , aged 15 .
Pistorius is now talking about what he does with his prosthetic legs when they 're not being used .
He explains that he habitually leaves them either covered with clothing or inside a bag , whether at home or training .
He says it is almost from shyness : They 're an extension of my body .
I do n't necessarily want to leave them where people can see them , or take them .
The trial has resumed after lunch .
Pistorius is still talking about the difficulty of maintaining friendships within the frantic schedule of his athletics career .
Here 's a few more slightly longer quotes from Pistorius , taken from news wires .
On being unable to sleep : I 'm scared to sleep .
I have terrible nightmares about things that happened that night , "" he said .
"" I can smell blood .
I wake up to being terrified .
On his mother 's worries about security : My mother had a lot of security concerns , we grew up in a family where my father was n't around much , she would often get scared at night , she would phone the police ...
My mother had a pistol .
She kept her firearm in a padded bag under her pillow .
On his mother 's death : When she passed away it was very unexpected .
We were n't informed that she was sick and by the time we were she was in a coma .
With the court at lunch
it 's now time for a summary of what we 've heard so far
: •
Oscar Pistorius has taken to the witness stand to begin giving evidence in his murder trial .
He began with a tearful , broken - voiced apology to the family and friends of Reeva Steenkamp , his girlfriend who he shot in February last year , believing –
he says –
she was an intruder .
•
Pistorius said there is "" not a moment "" when he does not think about her family , and prays for them daily .
He added : "" I 've tried to put my words on paper many times to write to you but no words would ever suffice "" • Pistorius said he had taken anti - depressants and sleeping pills since the shooting , often waking with "" terrible nightmares "" in which he dreamed he could smell blood .
He said he often calls his sister to sit with him during the night .
On one occasion he climbed into a cupboard to call her .
•
The rest of his testimony so far concerned his family background and athletics career .
Pistorius said his mother was fearful of intruders and kept a pistol under her pillow .
Her death when he was 15 affected him very badly .
•
Pistorius also said a speedboat accident in 2009 which almost killed him left him fearful and withdrawn .
•
Earlier , the first defence witness was a pathologist , Prof Jan Botha , who questioned prosecution evidence that Steenkamp must have eaten about two hours before her death at 3 am , something which runs counter to Pistorius 's statement that they went to bed at 10 pm .
•
Botha was questioned aggressively and at length by the prosecution counsel , Gerrie Nel , giving a taste of the likely cross - examination Pistorius will face .
•
While this evidence was heard , including details of Steenkamp 's injuries and photos of wounds and blood , Pistorius spent much of the time with his hands over his face , also retching .
The court is now breaking for lunch .
Pistorius is now recounting a speedboat accident in which he was badly injured in 2009 , which briefly left him in intensive care and in a coma for several days .
The boat accident had "" a massive impact "" and left him withdrawn and fearful , he says , and badly affected his running form .
Pistorius says his work in developing prostheses led to Strathclyde university awarding him an honorary doctorate .
His success , earnings and busy schedule had an impact on his friendships , he adds , and many of his friends changed :
It changes a lot of the dynamics in a person 's life .
The live video feed at the top of this blog is now working again .
Apologies for the long delay .
Pistorius is now talking about his work with disability charities .
Now we are on the lengthy background evidence Pistorius 's voice is notably more steady .
Roux asks about Pistorius 's mobility when not wearing his prosthetic legs , a potentially key point in terms of when he fired the fatal shots .
He says : I do n't have balance on my stumps .
I can stand on my stumps .
I ca n't stand still on my stumps .
There is a particular imbalance with his left stump , he says , and he can not place weight on it without his prosthetic legs .
If his dog came into his room before he put on his prosthetic legs it would often knock him over , he adds .
There are no photographs of Pistorius in the witness stand .
That is down to the same court rules which mean he is also not being shown on the video feed .
Pistorius is now talking through the rapid progress of the Paralympic running career , and how in parallel he was one of South Africa 's top 400 m runners in able - bodied events .
This led to a lengthy legal battle ahead of the 2008 Olympics to prove his prosthetic legs did not offer an unfair advantage .
He won the case , but too late to qualify for the Beijing Games , which he says was a major blow .
But by 2011 he was running in the able - bodied world championships , and raced at the 2012 London Olympics .
Here is a more full quote of the tearful apology to Steenkamp 's family with which he began his evidence : I want to apologise to Reeva 's family , to those of you who knew her and are here today .
There is not a moment and there has n't been a moment since this tragedy happened that I have n't thought about your family .
I wake up in the morning
and you 're the first people I think of , the first people I pray for .
I can promise that when she went to bed that night she felt loved .
I 've tried to put my words on paper many times to write to you but no words would ever suffice .
As a reminder , David Smith , in court , is live tweeting this evidence .
After his mother 's death , Pistorius says , weekends and holidays from boarding school were slightly chaotic , with he and his siblings staying with a variety of friends and family members .
They stayed rarely with his father , who had divorced from his mother .
Pistorius is now being asked about the effect of his mother 's sudden death , when he was a teenager .
He says , his voice shaking again : We spent all our time with her .
Everything I learned in life I learned from her .
After trying out running at a disabled event , Pistorius says , he went to America to train as a Paralympian , and then joined the South African team , later taking part in elite able bodied 400 m races .
At high school , when he was a boarder , Pistorius says , he was "" never much of an academic "" but loved sport .
He began playing rugby and water polo but then moved over to athletics .
Pistorius says he tried and enjoyed sport at primary school : I was n't very good at most of them
but I tried them all .
He then explains that as his father was away a lot his mother kept a pistol for security , and was often scared about intruders and called the police .
She kept her pistol in a bag under her pillow .
Still more on his childhood .
Pistorius says he was very occasionally bullied for his disability at school , but his mother made him feel he should stand up for himself .
Pistorius , whose voice is still shaky but now slightly more composed , is explaining how he was born without fibula bones in his legs , and had both legs partially amputated when he was 11 months old .
Seven months later he was walking , he says .
His mother never made him feel any different with his disability , he adds .
Pistorius , who we can not see on the video feed , is giving some background about his family life , led along by Roux , his defence counsel .
He discusses his great closeness to his mother , who died when he was 15 .
Pistorius says he often calls his sister , who lives nearby , to sit with him during the night .
On one occasion he climbed into a cupboard to call her , he says .
His voice is very shaky .
He says he never wants to touch a firearm again , and does not want to be near one .
Pistorius now explains that since the shooting he has taken anti - depressants and sleeping pills .
He finds it hard to sleep .
I am scared to sleep ...
I have terrible nightmares about what happened that night .
I wake up and I can smell blood .
Such is the terror he did not sleep for several weeks , he adds .
Pistorius starts with an apology , in a breaking voice : I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to Mr and Mrs Steenkamp , to Reeva 's family , to those of you who knew her and are here today .
Pistorius says there has not been a moment when his first thought has not been for the family and the pain he has caused them .
He is near tears throughout , and at times can barely be heard .
Pistorius is sworn in by the judge .
He sounds close to tears , his voice breaking .
Oscar Pistorius is called to give evidence .
That 's it for Prof Botha .
He is excused by the judge .
Pistorius is called .
There is an intermittent live feed – though not , sadly , on this page – and it seems Nel is still quizzing Botha in detail about the sequence of shots .
This is , of course , vital as it could determine whether or not Steenkamp called out in fear between shots .
If she did it would greatly undermine Pistorius 's defence that he thought he was shooting at an intruder .
The live feed has broken again , so I 'm afraid there will be another delay in any updates .
Botha is being questioned about how he was able to determine the chronological sequence of the bullet wounds suffered by Steenkamp .
Pistorius appears to find all this very hard to listen to .
I have a video link again .
Botha is still being cross - examined .
At the moment , it 's worth mentioning , we still do n't know if Pistorius will begin his evidence today .
The live video feed has now completely stopped .
David Smith , in court , tweets this .
The live video feed of the hearing is not working very well , so my updates might be a bit patchy till it starts working properly again .
More from my colleague , David Smith , in court .
The hearing has resumed .
Nel is still cross - examining Prof Jan Botha , the pathologist called by the defence .
The court is now taking a half - hour break so Nel can consult with the prosecution team .
It will resume at 11.15am local time ( 10.15 BST ) .
Nel , the defence counsel , is taking a very direct , confrontational approach to picking apart Botha 's evidence .
Here 's one observation : I find it very strange
I have to ask you questions three times .
Pistorius , who of course is watching all this , can only expect the same treatment .
Botha 's lengthy and quite complex cross - examination continues with a discussion of which wounds blood on the toilet floor came from .
Botha 's slightly testy cross - examination continues .
Some quick context as to Botha 's evidence .
The state pathologist , Professor Gert Saayman , told the prosecution case that Steenkamp most likely ate two hours before her death at 3 am , which appeared to counter Pistorius 's version that the pair had gone to bed at 10 pm , meaning he was disoriented and woken from sleep when he shot her .
It is thus significant for the defence to be able to have another senior pathologist saying the science of determining this is too vague to be certain .
Nel is quizzing Botha as to whether he can rule out the two - hour timing .
Botha says not : only that he says it 's hard to determine .
The defence questioning of Botha is now over , and he is being fairly rigorously cross - examined by the prosecution counsel , Gerrie Nel , largely on quite technical issues about the nature of abrasions .
Pistorius has , again , been badly affected by evidence about Steenkamp 's injuries and death .
Botha is now describing the effect of the gunshots on Steenkamp .
The shot to the hip would have caused instability , while that to the arm would have stopped the arm working , he says .
The shot to the head would have caused almost instant unconsciousness .
He says : "" I do n't think she would have survived much longer .
"" It would be unlikely Steenkamp could have reacted by calling or screaming if the shots were fired in rapid succession , he says .
This contradicts the prosecution evidence that Steenkamp was sitting on the magazine rack when the second shot struck her , Roux notes .
Botha agrees , saying he thinks the evidence points otherwise .
Roux is now taking Botha onto the issue of wound ballistics .
The pathologist is asked if he can ascertain the chronology of the shots which struck Steenkamp , and replies that he believes he can .
Botha says the first shot was the one over the right hip , which happened when Steenkamp was standing near the door .
This was also the prosecution 's opinion .
She then fell forward and was struck on the right arm by a second shot , Botha says .
He then "" suspects "" the third shot was the one that injured her left hand and hit the toilet wall .
She then fell onto a magazine rack , and as she was falling down she was struck on the right side of the head , Botha said .
As those who are watching the live video feed will have noted , Prof Botha is not being pictured giving evidence –
all the images are of other sections of the court , mainly Roux and the judge , plus occasional cutaways to Pistorius .
That would appear to indicate that when Pistorius himself takes the stand we might only hear his voice , and not see him in the stand .
A quick note : my colleague , David Smith , is at today 's hearing , and is live tweeting the evidence , as here .
Botha tells the court he has conducted thousands of post mortem examinations where people have been shot .
He is now being asked by Roux about the physical phenomenon called gastric emptying , as a way of determining the time between a last meal and death .
This was cited by Prof Gert Saayman , who performed the post mortem on Reeva Steenkamp and spoke as a prosecution witness , and said Steenkamp could have eaten her last meal about two hours before her death .
Botha , however , says it is an inexact procedure , with all sorts of factors which can change the process , and thus affect calculations of time of death .
It is so imprecise as to effectively be "" speculation "" , Botha says .
Pisorius 's defence counsel , Barry Roux , is talking Botha through his qualifications and experience as a pathologist , which are extensive .
The hearing has opened .
My video feed is a bit patchy , and it began part - way through the opening statement .
Prof Botha is being called .
Judge Thokozile Masipa asks if there are any objections to his being the first defence witnesses .
There are not and he is sworn in .
While we await the start of proceedings , here is a piece by Sandile Memela for the Guardian Africa network , which asks the question : had Pistorius killed a black man , would it be an issue ?
I do n't think so .
I believe there would n’t have been a trial .
Instead , he would have been hailed as a hero : “
Here is a man who did good by shooting to kill a black thief !
”
Everyone would have understood and accepted that crime has reached intolerable levels in our society .
The perpetrators are often black men who are unemployed and poor .
And they deserve to be shot down in cold blood for disturbing the peace of suburban life ?
Many white South Africans live in fear of being attacked by black criminals .
Much as they may build sky high walls , they must double that with high - calibre guns in case black security men at the gate allow intruders to slip through .
You can not trust a black man .
White paranoia has driven some white men to shoot first and ask questions later .
We all know and accept it is mostly black men who are robbers and thieves who prey on hard - working white families .
This is the story of our lives .
We know that Pistorius made a terrible mistake .
As a white male you do not kill a white woman , especially the one you profess to love .
Your role and responsibility is to protect and defend her against black men .
But if you happen to have killed her , for whatever reason , you must pin the blame on an intruder .
It is acceptable for white men to shoot and kill black men to protect their property and beloved families .
You will , of course , see that we have a live video feed of today 's hearing at the top of the page .
It 's currently showing the outside of the courtroom , but will move inside once proceedings begin .
My colleague , David Smith , has previewed today 's hearing , and what we can possibly expected from the first defence evidence : Pistorius will be back in the glare of the world 's media when his murder trial resumes on Monday but , in an unorthodox legal move , he will not be the first witness for his own defence ...
Instead he is expected to follow Prof Jan Botha , a pathologist , on the stand at the high court in Pretoria ...
Brian Webber , one of Pistorius 's lawyers , told Agence France - Presse : "" We do n't have a choice .
The pathologist has personal reasons for why he has to take the stand first . ""
The delay might have afforded a pause in media coverage , but Webber said it had given those working on the case little respite . ""
If you think it 's been a week off , then good luck for you . ""
Botha , the chief pathologist in Free State province , did not take part in the postmortem on 29-year - old Steenkamp but is likely to raise questions over the evidence of the state pathologist Prof Gert Saayman .
This may include challenging the suggestion that Steenkamp probably last ate at about 1 am on the night she died , which appears at odds with Pistorius 's claim that they retired to his bedroom at 10 pm .
The defence witness list also includes a neighbour who reportedly lives significantly closer to the athlete than those on the prosecution side who testified that they heard a woman 's terrified screams .
The neighbour is likely to support defence counsel Barry Roux 's claim that the screams came from Pistorius himself ‚ thus neutralising a central tenet of the prosecution case .
Roux is expected to present the results of his own sound tests on the estate ...
The trial is now scheduled to run to at least mid - May .
Today the trial of Oscar Pistorius , the South African Paralympic and Olympic runner , for the alleged murder of his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , enters a new and crucial phase with the opening of the 27-year - old 's defence case .
We had 15 days of prosecution testimony up to 28 March , after which the trial was postponed today , due to the illness of a judge 's assistant .
Pistorius 's evidence as to why he shot Steenkamp through a toilet door at his home in February last year will , of course , be crucial to the case .
However , he will not be the first defence witness .
That will be a pathologist , Prof Jan Botha , with Pistorius expected to take the stand next , though not today .
The athlete is charged with premeditated murder for Steenkamp 's death , with prosecutors saying he deliberately shot at Steenkamp four times through the door in his bathroom on Valentine 's Day last year , hitting her in the head , arm and hip .
Pistorius insists says he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder .
The hearing is due to begin at 9.30am South African time ( 8.30am BST ) ."
2014-04-07,"He did not look at the lawyers , the sea of faces in the public gallery or the red - robed judge who will decide his guilt .
When Oscar Pistorius got the chance to explain himself in person after nearly 14 months of silence , he turned to address the woman whose daughter he killed .
The Paralympian 's voice quivered , cracked and trailed off as he offered a very public apology to his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp 's mother .
But if Pistorius , who went on to tell the court about his religious faith , was making a plea for absolution , it did not appear to move June Steenkamp , who remained impassive .
This intense , extraordinary moment between two people who had never met before the murder trial came on Monday as the defence opened its case at the high court in Pretoria , South Africa .
Pistorius admits shooting Steenkamp through a toilet door on Valentine 's day last year but insists he mistook her for an intruder .
"" My lady , may I please start my evidence by tendering an apology , "" the 27-year - old , standing in the witness box , asked judge Thokozile Masipa in a tremulous , almost boyish voice that was barely audible .
"" I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to Mr and Mrs Steenkamp , to Reeva 's family , to those of you who knew her who are here today . ""
Masipa intervened tenderly : "" Mr Pistorius , I do n't like doing this to you
but I can hardly hear you . ""
Pistorius responded softly : "" I beg your pardon , my lady , I 'll speak up .
I 'd like to apologise and say that there 's not a moment and there has n't been a moment since this tragedy happened that I have n't thought about your family .
I wake up every morning
and you 're the first people I think of , the first people I pray for .
I ca n't imagine the pain and the sorrow and the emptiness that I 've caused you and your family . ""
Fighting back tears , jaw trembling and tissue in hand , he continued : "" I was simply trying to protect Reeva .
I can promise that when she went to bed that night she felt loved .
I 've tried to put my words on paper many , many times to write to you but no words will ever suffice .
"" It was , legal experts said , a highly unusual move .
As Pistorius struggled to get out the words there was a tense silence in the courtroom except for the ripple of typing on journalists ' laptops .
His sister Aimee looked distraught , her mouth open a little , her eyes filled with tears .
June Steenkamp , wearing a black jacket and white blouse , has previously criticised Pistorius for failing to acknowledge her on the first day of the trial and seemed unmoved by his appeal .
A source close to her said : "" He did say through his lawyer that he was going to apologise
so she knew it was coming .
She steeled herself but it was tough on her :
I could see she was stressed out .
It 's amazing how she holds it together and shows no emotion .
""
The source added : "" Reeva was such a shining light and to take her away was so cruel , so an apology is the least her mother expected .
"" It was hard to reconcile Pistorius 's despondent figure in black suit and tie and white shirt with the "" blade runner "" who thrilled stadiums around the world and became the first amputee to run in the Olympics .
The ferocity of the legal and moral contest at the high court has made a mockery of the pressure he faced when competing for medals .
Pistorius described the devastating effect the shooting has had on his life .
He said he had been on anti - depressants and sleeping pills because of his disturbed state of mind .
"" I 'm scared to sleep , "" he said .
"" I have terrible nightmares about things that happened that night .
I can smell blood .
I wake up to being terrified …
I wake up in a complete state of terror to the point that I would rather not sleep . ""
Gulping for air and struggling to speak , he said he continues to live in fear of intruders : "" I ca n't remember if it was towards the end of last year or the beginning of this year , I woke up in a panic .
I 'm blessed that my sister stays on the same property as I do ,
so I can phone her in the middle of the night which I often do to come and sit by me .
"" Obviously I never want to handle a firearm again or be around firearms , so I 've got a security guard that stands outside my front door at night .
But I woke up
and I was terrified
and I for some reason could n't calm myself down , so I climbed into the cupboard and phoned my sister to sit with me for a while , which she did . ""
A source of comfort during the past year has been religion , Pistorius said .
Recalling how his late mother Sheila sang in the Methodist church choir on Sundays , he added : "" It does n't matter what may come of life , we always find refuge in the Lord . ""
Steenkamp "" was a very good Christian "" , he continued .
"" She would pray about my travelling and all of the small things in my life …
My religion is what 's got me through this last year
…
my God is my refuge .
"" Earlier in the day Pistorius had vomited as a pathologist described Steenkamp 's fatal injuries .
But under gentle questioning from the defence , he gained composure as he talked about his early life , his disability ( "" I do n't have balance on my stumps "" ) , the influence of his mother and her unexpected death , his athletics career , his work for a charity helping victims of landmines and a boating accident that could have killed him .
He also spoke affectionately about dogs he acquired : a Jack Russell , bull terrier and American pitbull .
Pistorius described an incident in which he saved a stranger from a violent assault .
And in a point crucial to the defence 's contention that he had reason to fear intruders , he told the court : "" Everyone in South Africa at some point has been exposed to crime . ""
He said his family had "" security concerns "" when he was young and his mother slept with a gun under her pillow .
He said his family had suffered house break - ins and carjackings , and said he had sometimes been followed while driving home .
Pistorius also referred to an incident in which he was allegedly assaulted at a social function in late 2012 and had to have stitches on the back of his head .
The trial adjourned earlier than usual at the request of defence counsel Barry Roux , who said Pistorius was exhausted after not sleeping the night before .
June Steenkamp mustered a smile and kisses for members of the ANC women 's league , regular supporters in court .
The case resumes on Tuesday with Pistorius still to face cross - examination ."
2014-04-08,"The court has adjourned early after the defence said Pistorius was too emotional to continue .
Here is a summary of the key points on another wrenching day in the murder trial .
•
Pistorius said he grabbed the gun he always kept under the bed when he heard a noise in the night •
He was terrified that intruders had come into the house •
He shouted for Steenkamp to call the police •
He thought the intruders were in the bathroom , shouted again for Steenkamp to call the police and fired four shots when he heard a noise inside •
He breaks down as he describes finding Steenkamp inside the bathroom not breathing The judge adjourns the court .
Roux says Pistorius is so emotional , his shirt is soaking wet and has asked for the trial to resume in the morning .
Just a recap of Pistorius 's key testimony .
Pistorius was shouting for Steenkamp as he stood outside the bathroom , then he heard a noise from inside and fired four shots .
He hit the door , managed to get ajar and opened with the key from the inside .
The court is back .
The judge orders an adjournment as Pistorius sobs uncontrollably .
"" I did n't know what to do , "" says Pistorius before a court hanging on to his every word .
The judge is watching him intently .
Pistorius 's sister , Aimee is crying .
He could n't see much in the bedroom , made his way back up the passage , he began to realise that Steenkamp may have been the bathroom .
He tried to open the door , but it was locked , ran back to the bedroom and shouted for the balcony for help .
He put his prosthetic legs on and tried to kick in the door .
"" I was just panicked at this point . ""
He ran back to the bedroom to get the cricket ban .
"" I do n't think I 've ever screamed like that . ""
"" I kept shouting for Reeva ... at this point it had not occurred to me that Reeva could be in the toilet . ""
He went back to the bedroom and tried to lift himself into the bedroom , but could not feel Reeva , he thought she had got on to the floor .
Pistorius is half - speaking , half - crying .
He started screaming again for Steenkamp to call the police .
He was n't sure if somebody was going to come out of the bathroom and attack him .
He heard a noise from inside the toilet . ""
Before I knew it I had fired four shots at the door .
"" I kept shouting for Reeva to call the police .
"" I do n't know how long I stood there .
"" There were no lights in the bathroom , says Pistorius .
He could see the window was open .
He had his gun pointing in front of him .
"" I was n't sure if intruders were in the toilet or on a ladder they would have used to gain access or around the corner , "" he tells the court .
The court is back from lunch .
Pistorius takes up his account of the key moments of the shooting .
He says he was sure that intruders were in the bathroom - the judge again asks him to raise his voice .
Here is an extract of Reuters 's version of the morning 's testimony .
South African Olympic and Paralympic sprinter Oscar Pistorius retched on the witness stand on Tuesday as he described the moments leading up to the shooting of his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , on Valentine 's Day last year .
During a morning of dramatic court testimony , Pistorius , who is accused of murdering Steenkamp , recounted how he heard a window sliding open in his bathroom in the middle of the night , convincing him an intruder was breaking in and that he needed to arm himself .
"" That 's the moment that everything changed , "" he said , his voice tense with emotion .
"" I thought that there was a burglar that was gaining entry to my home . ""
When post mortem pictures of Steenkamp 's bloodstained body briefly flashed up on the courtroom television monitors , the 27-year - old athlete doubled over in the witness stand , retching into his cupped hands.﻿ AP has a short take on when Pistorius took off his prosthetic legs in court .
Oscar Pistorius described what he said were the moments before he shot Reeva Steenkamp to death and even removed his prosthetic legs in court and stood by the toilet door which he had fired into last year .
Pistorius testified Tuesday that he heard a window open in his bathroom in the early hours of Feb. 14 , 2013 , causing him to believe intruders had entered his house .
He said "" that 's the moment when everything changed . ""
The double - amputee was asked by defense lawyer Barry Roux to stand by the toilet door through which he shot .
In a dramatic moment , he took off his prosthetics and approached the door in court.﻿ • Just before the court is adjourned for lunch , Pistorius describes grabbing the gun he always kept under the bed after hearing a noise in the night •
He screamed at the "" intruders "" to get out of his home .
It was dark .
He was not wearing his prosthesis •
He shouted for Steenkamp to call the police •
The Paralympian spent much of the morning reading scores of the email the couple sent each other , many of them highly affectionate
The court is shown a picture of the passage way leading to the bathroom and then a bathroom window .
Roux asks for an adjournment as it 's almost 1 pm , so we stop just before Pistorius is asked about the shooting .
Just before he got to the passage of the bathroom he heard a door slam which could only have been the bathroom which confirmed that somebody was in there .
He says he heard a noise and thought somebody was coming in , the first thing that ran through his mind was he needed to arm himself and protect Steenkamp .
It was very dark .
He grabbed the gun from beneath the bed , he shouted for Steenkamp to call the police , he was shouting and screaming for people to get out of his home .
He did n't have his legs on .
Pistorius says he woke up , it was extremely warm , the fans were still on .
Steenkamp was still awake .
He got out of the bed and changed the positions of the fans , closed and locked the sliding doors .
There are long pauses as he speaks in a shaky voice .
There 's a long pause from Pistorius and Roux asks for a five - minute adjournment before discussing the athlete 's prosthetics Pistorius can barely speak as he chokes up .
She told him to brush his teeth , he came to bed , he placed the gun by the bed , he climbed on to the left - hand side of the bed , which was not usual because of his shoulder .
Steenkamp was still sitting on the bed while he lay on his stomach watching TV .
He was getting increasingly tired and asked her to close the doors before going to sleep .
It was a very warm night .
He is asked to speak up as he again falters .
Pistorius is now taking us the events of 13 and 14 February , the day Steenkamp was shot and killed .
He locked the bedroom door as he did every night and put a cricket bat near the lock as it was not very strong .
There was an alarm system .
And here is the top of the Associated Press ' version .
Testifying in his murder trial on Tuesday , Oscar Pistorius said he and girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp sometimes had troubles in their relationship but that they sorted them out , were in love and were planning a life together .
Prosecutors say Pistorius was often jealous and overbearing in his relationship with Steenkamp and killed her intentionally after a loud argument in the pre - dawn hours of Valentine 's Day last year .
Pistorius claims he shot the 29-year - old model by mistake through a toilet door at his house , thinking she was a dangerous intruder .
Pistorius referred to a phone message Steenkamp sent him in late January 2013 when she said she was sometimes "" scared "" of the double - amputee Olympic athlete .
The prosecution presented the message earlier in the trial as an indicator of Pistorius ' threatening behavior .
Pistorius , 27 , said Tuesday that the couple had a disagreement at a social function that day and he was "" maybe just being sensitive , insecure or jealous . ""
Pistorius said he apologized to Steenkamp and sent her a message saying : "" I want to talk to you .
I want to sort this out . ...
I 'm sorry for the things that I say without thinking . ""
"" My lady , I think it was a bad day in our relationship , "" Pistorius said , addressing the judge who will ultimately deliver a verdict in the trial that began last month .
Defense lawyer Barry Roux asked Pistorius if the unhappiness in their relationship had passed and Pistorius replied yes.﻿
The wire agencies have filed their first takes on the morning session .
Here is an extract from Agence France Presse .
Star Paralympian Oscar Pistorius returned to the witness box at his murder trial on Tuesday , insisting he and girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp had a loving relationship and saw a future together before he shot her dead on Valentine 's Day .
Pistorius sat before a packed courtroom wearing a dark grey suit describing how the couple met and gradually began to plan their future , a day after an emotional first day on the stand that saw him issue a tearful apology to the victim 's family .
The Paralympic gold medallist is accused of premeditated murder over Steenkamp 's murder in February 2013 , but claims he shot her through a locked toilet door believing she was an intruder .
On Tuesday the athlete known as the "" Blade Runner "" described how he met the model at a track day car event . ""
The first six days we knew each other we called each other every day , "" he said .
"" I was very keen on Reeva , "" he said .
"" I think if anything I was more into her , than she was at times with me . ""
"" We started really seeing a future with each other , "" he said .
Called as witness in his own defence , Pistorius has insisted he and the 29-year - old law graduate , model and aspiring actress had a loving relationship and sought to explain text messages in which Steenkamp said she was scared of him .
"" I just think it was a bad hour in our relationship , "" he said , describing a fight at an engagement party .
Steenkamp had sent Pistorius a message saying : "" I 'm scared of you sometimes and how you snap at me and how you will act towards me . ""
Steenkamp 's mother June attended Tuesday 's hearing along with Steenkamp 's friend Gina Myers , who was wearing tags that bore a black - and - white print of the model .
Now we are being taken through the firing of gun in a restaurant .
He says it was an accident .
"" I could n't really believe what had happened , "" he said .
He says he could n't believe that his friend Darren Fresco had handed him a loaded weapon in a restaurant .
He was angry that Fresco had been so careless .
Fresco agreed to take the blame , says Pistorius , saying the gun got hooked on Fresco 's trousers .
But Pistorius told the restaurant manager that it was his fault , but the Fresco version was the one accepted by the restaurant .
Pistorius denies that he ever fired through the car sunroof .
Pistorius says he was angry at the way the police had handled his weapon , emptying the magazine .
Pistorius says he always carried a firearm on him .
Here 's the context of the incident as David Smith reported earlier in the trial ( Samantha ) Taylor said she , Pistorius and a friend , Darren Fresco , had been pulled over by a policeman for speeding .
When he saw Pistorius 's pistol lying on the car seat , the officer picked it up and emptied its magazine on to the floor of the car , prompting an outburst from Pistorius , she said .
When they were allowed to go on their way , Pistorius and Fresco started to joke about shooting out a "" robot "" – a South African term for a traffic light .
"" Oscar was very angry , "" said Taylor , who was sitting in the back seat at the time .
"" Thereafter they were joking around and saying they wanted to shoot a robot .
Two minutes after , I saw Oscar take his gun and shoot out of the car roof .
A very loud sound .
They both
laughed.""﻿
The trial has resumed and Roux takes us through more messages , some deal with going to the physio for a sore shoulder .
Now we are about to hear about the incident when Pistorius shot a gun through a car 's sunroof .
• Barry Roux , the defence lawyer , has spent the morning getting Oscar Pistorius to read out message after message he and Steenkamp sent each other .
•
Pistorius , who seemed more composed today , but occasionally chocking back tears , described the early stages of the relationship , how it was sometimes difficult , because of their previous troublesome relationships .
•
He described how he was keener on her than she was in him at the start and the pressures both felt because they were in the public eye .
•
The defence seems to be making the point that these affectionate messages back and forth more reflect the reality of the relationship than the ones presented by the prosecution in which Steenkamp said she was sometimes scared of Pistorius .
Pistorius chokes up as he reads more messages .
He has to pause between some of them .
Barry Roux , the defence lawyer , is laying out their relationship in a series of ardent messages of endearment and affection , the kind people send each other when they are in love .
The court rises as the judge adjourns proceedings .
Pistorius 's defence lawyer is now taking the Paralympian through messages in February .
All very much in the same tone , how much they miss each other , how he loves spending time with her and sleeping next to her .
How he appreciates her support .
His voice breaks .
The live feed alternates between shots of the Steenkamp family , the defence , and the couple 's messages , which appear on a blue screen .
They exchange one - word messages saying "" Boobi "" and "" Baba "" and lots of messages saying how much they miss each other .
In one message , Pistorious says "" I am the luckiest guy ever "" after she send him a picture of her .
A message from Steenkamp says how much she misses him .
Lots of kisses go back and forth .
More smiley faces .
These are a series of messages from January .
The defence is taking us through more messages the two exchanged .
They portray a highly affectionate relationship with lots of endearments , like "" my angel "" , smiley faces .
Pistorius is reading them out to the court , one after another .
At times , he chokes up .
The defence seems to want to make the point that the messages where Steenkamp said she was afraid of Pistorius were an aberration and that most of the messages were in fact of a loving nature .
Nicki Goulding from CNN says the defence is laying out these messages to show a totally different context to the messages the prosecution put out earlier in the trial .
Another message from him to her , saying she looked lovely during a photo shoot .
There are several messages in which he expresses his support for her in her work .
Pistorius says Steenkamp was struggling with the media attention as she was unused to it .
He reads a message from Steenkamp saying how people were trying to plant doubts in her mind .
He reads a series a messages from him to her , one of which he is not the easiest person to understand .
How despite their arguments they are basically similar people .
Lots of messages ending in kisses and terms of endearment like "" boo "" .
"" I 'm crazy about you , "" he tells her in one message .
Again he says Steenkamp was receiving a lot of hate mail .
The messages are from January .
In one he advised her not to go for a run because he did n't think it would be safe .
He is now talking about the pressures he was under on finances , from the media , setting up the new house .
Pistorius is being taken through a series of messages .

2014-04-08,
2014-04-08,"Wild , agonising howls filled a normally sterile courtroom on Tuesday as the murder trial that has captured the world 's attention like no other in recent years witnessed its most visceral drama yet .
Oscar Pistorius suffered an emotional collapse on the witness stand and let out great , heaving sobs as he relived "" the moment that everything changed "" , recounting for the first time the night that he shot dead his girlfriend .
When the star athlete , who claims he mistook her for an intruder , described breaking down a door and finding the bloodied body of Reeva Steenkamp , the words "" she was n't breathing "" erupted from him in a terrible cry .
He yielded all self - possession and moaned loudly in the stunned courtroom .
The trial came to a standstill and Pistorius 's distraught brother and sister rushed across the room to console him .
It was a wrenching end to the 18th day of the trial in Pretoria , the capital of South Africa .
Pistorius , the first amputee to run in the Olympics , had been struggling through his long - awaited account of the early hours of 14 February 2013 , when he fired four times through a locked toilet door and killed Steenkamp .
The 27-year - old described how the couple had a quiet evening and retired to his bedroom , where he spoke to his cousin on the phone and she did yoga .
He had fallen asleep but woke up in the dead of night .
Steenkamp , also awake , asked him , ' Ca n't you sleep , baba ? '
he said .
He went out to his balcony to bring in two fans .
Then , in pitch dark , Pistorius believed he heard the sound of a window sliding open in the bathroom , he said .
"" ' I thought that a burglar had got into the house .
I think I initially just froze .
I interpreted it as someone getting into the bathroom .
That 's the moment that everything changed .
The first thing that ran through my mind was to protect Reeva and I and to get my gun . ""
He said he grabbed a 9 mm pistol from beneath his bed . ""
At that point I just wanted to put myself between the person who had gained access to my house and Reeva .
I slowed down and had my firearm extended in front of me .
I whispered to Reeva to get down and phone the police . ""
He said he entered the passage leading to bathroom and was "" overcome with fear .
I screamed and shouted to the person to get out of the house .
I did n't have my legs on .
Just before I got to the passage I heard a door slam .
It could have only been the toilet door .
It confirmed that there was a person or people inside the bathroom .
"" There were long pauses in his testimony as he steeled himself to go on .
"" I got to the entrance of the bathroom at the end of the passage where I stopped screaming .
At this point I was certain that the intruders were in the bathroom
…
I was n't sure if someone was going to come out of the toilet and attack me . ""
Then I heard a noise from inside the toilet , what I perceived to be someone coming out of the toilet .
Before I knew it I had fired four shots at the door .
My ears were still ringing –
I could n't hear anything –
so I kept shouting for Reeva to phone the police .
I was still scared to retreat because I was n't sure if there was somebody on the ladder or someone in the toilet . ""
Pistorius said he then went back to the bedroom and realised that Steenkamp was no longer in bed .
"" I retreated to the corner of the bed while talking to Reeva .
She did n't respond .
I lifted myself onto the bed .
"" I felt if Reeva was there .
I could n't feel anything .
I thought she had gone down on the floor .
I kept my firearm pointing towards the passage .
It dawned on me that it could be Reeva in the toilet .
I jumped off the bed and tried to see if she was hiding behind the curtain .
"" I did n't want to believe that it could be Reeva in the toilet .
I was still scared that someone was coming to attack us . ""
He went back to the toilet and pushed the door
but it was locked , he added .
"" I shouted from the balcony for help .
Help !
Help !
Help ! ""
By now he was convulsed was in a panic , he said .
"" I was screaming and shouting at this stage .
I was crying out for the Lord to help me .
I was crying for Reeva
…
At that point all I wanted to do was just look inside to see if it was Reeva . ""
He dashed back to the bathroom again with a cricket bat and began to smash down the door of the toilet .
"" I hit the door three times and there was a big plank .
I grabbed it with my hands and threw it into the bathroom . ""
His voice choking as he approached the moment of realisation , he said : "" Whilst I leant over the partition to get in , I saw the key , so I took it
and I unlocked the door , and I flung the door open , and I threw it open .
And I sat over Reeva
and I cried
and I do n't know how long I was there for .
She was n't breathing . ""
When Pistorius comes to be cross - examined by the prosecution , he may be pressed on the last point , which contrasts with his statement at a bail application hearing last year in which he said : "" Reeva was slumped over but alive . ""
Many observers following his testimony on Tuesday also questioned why Steenkamp would not have called back to him when he was shouting .
One of the police investigators in the prosecution case told the Guardian there are "" lots of holes "" in his story , adding : "" He should come clean .
He will feel better for it . ""
As Pistorius wailed in anguish , hands pressed to his eyes , the emotion was reflected in the faces of his family as his sister Aimee , uncle Arnold and aunt Lois all wept softly in the public gallery .
Judge Thokozile Masipa swiftly intervened to call an adjournment .
Steenkamp 's mother , June , who has remained stoical in recent days , had also broken down during the harrowing testimony and covered her face with her hand .
After a brief adjournment , defence counsel Barry Roux returned to say his client 's shirt was wet and he was in no state to continue .
Earlier , the trial witnessed another extraordinary spectacle when Pistorius , known as the "" blade runner "" , entered court having changed his suit and tie for a white sweater and black lycra shorts .
He was asked by Roux to stand by the toilet door through which he shot .
He then sat down in the packed courtroom , took off his prosthetics and approached the door with an uneven gait – appreciably shorter and arguably more vulnerable than he has been seen in public before .
At another point , Pistorius slumped forward and appeared to retch as an autopsy photo of Steenkamp 's bloodied head was accidentally shown to the court .
He also described how he met Steenkamp and how they quickly grew closer .
He said they had begun to plan a future together .
"" I was very keen on Reeva , "" he said .
"" We started really seeing a future with each other . ""
The Paralympic champion , who faces a possible life sentence , was in tears as he read WhatsApp messages that he and Steenkamp , a law graduate and model , had sent each other during their four - month relationship .
In one , she sent him a cartoon image of a house with the caption : "" He is the happiest , be he king or peasant , who finds peace in his home . ""
Pistorius also testified that he had got home on 13 February , hours before the killling , to find a Valentine 's gift from Steenkamp that she told him not to open until the next day .
When he eventually did take off its white wrapping paper , he found a picture frame with four photographs of the couple .
In an unfortunate slip , he said he had waited until 8 August to open the present because it would have been Steenkamp 's birthday .
In fact her birthday was 19 August ."
2014-04-09,"The court has adjourned for the day .
It 's been another day of high drama as the prosecution began cross questioning Pistorius .
Nel fully lived up to his aggressive reputation and early on urged the athlete to take responsibility for killing Steenkamp rather than saying it was a mistake .
The day 's most gripping moment when a forensic image of Steenkamp 's head appeared on the court monitors .
Pistorius refused to look at it .
Nel is seeking to pick inconsistencies between the evidence Pistorius gave in court and during his bail testimony .
Pistorius often gave detailed but roundabout answers prompting Nel to accuse him of giving rehearsed answers instead of responding to questions .
Nel : "" Reeva does n't have a life because of what you 've done .
"" Nel is still trying to get Pistorius to say "" yes "" or "" no "" to whether it was an accidental discharge .
Pistorius says he did not intend to fire into the door .
Nel shows that this contradicts his bail testimony .
Pistorius said he had his finger on the trigger and shot because he was afraid .
Nel has given up on whether fans were plugged in or not , now he 's moving on the whether the shooting was accidental .
Nel is pressing Pistorius on whether fans were plugged in or not .
Sometimes his memory is very precise , other times not so .
This is a very different Pistorius , calm , standing his ground , giving quite detailed but convoluted answers to Nel 's questions .
Nel is finding it hard to get straight answers from him .
Nel again badgers Pistorius for not answering the question , but coming up with prepared answers .
We are still on the subject of contamination of the crime scene .
Gerrie Nel came out very aggressively on first day of cross - questioning .
Many will question whether he went too far in showing a forensic photo of Steenkamp 's head .
Court is back .
Nel is asking Pistorius whether he pleaded not guilty because he thought the crime scene was contaminated .
Pistorius says no . ""
"" I plead not guilty because what I 'm accused of did not happen . ""
He seems very au fait with the legal details of the case as he gets into a discussion of tampering at the crime scene .
He says people were not wearing protective clothing , cell phones were moved .
Nel says Pistorius is using answers prepared in his head rather than answering questions .
Reuters has a longer version , so here is an extract .
He ( Gerrie Nel ) opened his case by asking Pistorius about his international reputation and strong Christian beliefs before hitting him with the reality of what took place .
"" You are a model for sportsmen , disabled and abled bodied sportsmen , all over the world ? ""
Nel asked .
"" I think I was , My Lady .
I made a mistake , "" replied Pistorius , answering to judge Thokozile Masipa , only the second black woman to ascend to the South African bench .
"" You killed a person , that 's what you did , "" came the reply .
"" I made a mistake .
My mistake was that I took Reeva 's life , "" 27-year - old Pistorius said .
"" You killed her .
You shot and killed her .
Wo n't you take responsibility for that ?
"" Nel said .
Nel then went on to ask whether Pistorius , well - known as a weapons enthusiast , knew what a ' zombie stopper ' was , to which Pistorius replied ' No ' .
After a brief adjournment , the court then viewed video footage broadcast on Britain 's Sky News of Pistorius firing a handgun at a water - melon at a shooting range .
As the melon disintegrates , a male voice off - camera that sounds like Pistorius says : "" It 's a lot softer than brains .
But ( bleep ) it 's like a zombie stopper . ""
Pistorius admitted it was his voice , leading to Nel to press him on his motives for wanting to see the water melon explode .
"" You know that the same happened to Reeva 's head .
It exploded .
I 'm going to show you , "" he said , before projecting a forensic photograph of Steenkamp 's head , the side and back of her head matted with blood and brains , on the court monitors . ""
Take responsibility for what you have done , "" he told Pistorius , eliciting gasps from the packed public gallery .
Pistorius hid his head in his hands in the witness stand , rocking from side to side , sobbing and saying he took responsibility "" but I will not look "" .
AP has filed a short story on the morning 's high drama , leading on the moment when the picture of Steenkamp was flashed up .
The chief prosecutor in Oscar Pistorius ' murder trial has urged the athlete to "" take responsibility "" for fatally shooting his girlfriend , pushing him to look at a police photograph of Reeva Steenkamp 's bloodied head that was displayed in court .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said Wednesday that Steenkamp 's head "" exploded "" when it was struck by one of four bullets that Pistorius fired through a closed toilet door in his home last year .
The photograph showed a sideview of Steenkamp 's head , with a mass of blood and human tissue on the back and upper parts .
Her eyes were closed .
Nel said : "" It 's time that you look at it . ""
Pistorius appeared distraught , saying he did n't have to look because he was at the scene when Steenkamp died .
Here is a lunchtime summary â€¢ Prosecution tells Pistorius to admit responsibility to killing â€¢ Court is shown "" zombie - stopper "" video showing Pistorius shooting a water melon â€¢ Pistorius refuses to look at image of Steenkamp 's bloodied head Nel is really trying to get Pistorius to admit that he was on the balcony when he heard a noise from the bathroom .
Roux rejects the contention that Pistorius has changed his testimony on where he was when he heard the noise .
The court breaks for lunch .
Nel is trying to draw out inconsistencies between Pistorius 's bail statement and witness testimony .
He is trying to determine where Pistorius was when he heard the noise in the bathroom .
Nel is saying that Pistorius was on the balcony where had gone to fetch the fans .
Pistorius says he was not on the balcony .
Nel again instructs Pistorius to answer the questions and not to argue .
Pistorius says he did fetch the fans from the balcony , but they were partly inside so he did not need to go on the balcony .
Several journalists in court make the point that Pistorius is keeping his eyes on the judge and avoiding any eye contact with Nel .
Pistorius says he has not changed his evidence , whether the state has , as Nel presses him .
Nel says Pistorius is not answering questions , but arguing .
"" I wrote my version of what happened that night and nothing has changed .
The state 's case has changed many times , "" says Pistorius .
Judge Thokozile Masipa shows some impatience at Nel 's approach .
Court is back and Nel resumes questioning on the zombie stopper incident .
He implies that the whole thing was carefully staged , with cameras positioned from different angles .
Pistorius agrees with Nel that he and others wanted to see the effect on a water melon .
Pistorius previously admitted using the phrase zombie stopper .
Pistorius admits his comments were distasteful .
Nel keeps pressing Pistorius to admit that they shot the melon to see what it would be like to shoot at human head .
Pistorius denies this .
South African journalist Mandy Wiener of Eyewitness News on the impact of the photo
The picture of Steenkamp 's head clearly shocked the courtroom There will be a lot of discussion of this moment in the trial , when a photo of Steenkamp 's bloodied head appeared on the screen .
People will be wondering whether Nel went too far . ""
Take responsibility for what you 've done "" barks Nel as he practially orders Pistorius to look at a picture of Steenkamp 's bloodied head .
It 's dramatic moment .
Pistorius can be heard crying .
Nel agrees to another adjournment so he can recover .
The court is back in session and discussion resumes on the video , Roux is unhappy about the use of the video , says it should be a precedent for introducing new material , but agrees to its showing so the case can resume .
The video is shown and shrill laughter from the clip resounds around the court .
Pistorius says he remembers it but does n't remember the phrase zombie stopper .
Nel insists that Pistorius used the phrase "" softer than brains "" referring to the water melon .
Here 's the version from the Associated Press Oscar Pistorius testified at his murder trial on Wednesday that girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp died in his arms after he shot her in his home last year .
The double - amputee runner was testifying for a third day , returning to the witness stand after weeping and wailing a day earlier while describing the moments he said he realized he had fatally shot his girlfriend by mistake .
He said he thought an intruder was in the house .
In early testimony Wednesday , Pistorius mostly kept his composure , though he often paused and his voice quavered in apparent distress while describing what he said were his desperate attempts to help the 29-year - old model after shooting her through a closed toilet door . ""
Reeva had died while I was holding her , "" Pistorius , 27 , said after describing how he put his fingers in her mouth to try to help her breathe and put his hand on her hip to try to stop bleeding from one of several gunshot wounds .
Pistorius said he felt "" helpless , "" and that he wanted to take Steenkamp to a hospital , but a neighbor advised him to wait for paramedics to arrive .
Police later appeared on the scene .
"" I asked a policeman if I could wash my hands because the smell of the blood was making me throw up , "" Pistorius said .
"" Every time I saw Reeva , I got sick .
So I stayed more inside the kitchen .
I sat in the pantry against the washing machine . ""
Here is Reuters on the day 's events so far .
South African state prosecutors started cross - examining Olympic and Paralympic sprinter Oscar Pistorius on Wednesday , vowing to "" get to the truth "" surrounding the killing of Pistorius ' girlfriend on Valentine 's day last year .
"" You killed Reeva Steenkamp , did n't you ? ""
prosecutor Gerrie Nel asked bluntly at the start of questioning , to which Pistorius , who is accused of murder , responded that he had made a mistake .
Earlier , Pistorius , fighting back tears , told the court about the immediate aftermath of the shooting and how he desperately tried to revive Steenkamp , who was hit by three of four pistol rounds fired through a locked toilet door .
Pistorius , who faces life in prison if convicted of murder , says the killing was a tragic error and that he fired after mistaking her for an intruder .
"" I checked to see if she was breathing and she was n't , "" the double amputee told the Pretoria High Court , describing his desperate attempts to pick up the 29-year - old law graduate and model , who pathologists said had been mortally wounded by one shot to the head .
"" I could feel the blood was running down on me , "" Pistorius said .
This is what Nel said as he began the case for the prosecution : "" You made a mistake ?
You killed a person .
That 's what you did .
You shot and killed Reeva . ""
Some reaction to Nel 's initial approach .
The Daily Mirror 's Lucy Thornton tweets : The trial has adjourned again as the defence is allowed to view the video .
Here is why it 's called the zombie stopper video , as Robyn Dixon of the Los Angeles Times tweets .
Looking at the video , it 's hardly surprising the defence does not want it to used by the prosecution , but context is all .
This is the so - called "" zombie stopper "" video , or part of it , that Judge Masipa has to decide whether can be used by the prosecution .
It shows Pistorius firing a shotgun and using a pistol to shoot a watermelon , which bursts on impact .
The video is part of a report from Sky News 's Alex Crawford .
The defence has finished questioning Pistorius , so here are the main points so far â€¢
He tells the court : "" I did not mean to kill Reeva , m'lady , or anyone else for that matter . ""
â€¢ Pistorius demonstrates for the court how he swung at the door while wearing his prostheses â€¢ Steenkamp died as he held her Nel wants to show video as part of character evidence and then ask questions based on it .
The judge adjourns , perhaps to mull over whether the video can be used .
There 's some back - and - forth between Nel , Roux and the judge on what could be introduced as evidence - a video .
Roux does not want the video , says it 's an "" ambush "" from the state .
Cross examination questions
yes
but the video is new and unfair Roux argues .
The live feed packed up for a moment , but it 's back and Gerrie Nel begins the prosecution 's case .
He 's got a difficult line to tread .
He has a reputation for being tough and aggressive but if he comes across as a bully given Pistorius ' traumatised state yesterday , it might swing opinion behind Pistorius .
Judges are not immune to public sentiment .
The full quote when Roux asked Pistorius whether he intended to kill Steenkamp .
Roux is asking Pistorius about the neighbours .
It turns out that the prosecution declined to call the two closest neighbours .
This is about whether the screams heard belonged to Steenkamp or Pistorius .
The defence says Pistorius 's screams were high - pitched like a woman .
"" I did not intend to kill Reeva or anybody else "" when Roux asks him whether he intended to kill Reeva .
The court adjourns for five minutes .
It 's worth rereading this piece by David Smith in which he lays out the key questions Pistorius must answer , particularly when the prosecution takes over .
It includes the question as to whether he was wearing his prosthetic limbs when he broke the door down .
Roux asks Pistorius to demonstrate how he kicked the door and then hit it with a cricket bat .
The BBC 's Pumza Fihlani says the defence will challenge the timing of the bat striking the door .
Barry Roux , the defence lawyer , asks Pistorius about hitting the bathroom door with the cricket bat .
Pistorius says he sat in the pantry against the washing machine .
He could n't look at Steenkamp around the corner because each time he got sick .
He was told to go to the garage where the police photographer asked him to take his clothes off .
He spent several hours there .
A policeman subsequently told him he was under arrest .
He was told to keep his head down as there was a lot of media .
The BBC 's Andrew Harding makes this point "" Reeva had already died while I was holding her , before the ambulance arrived so I knew there was nothing more I could do for her , "" Pistorius tells the court in a tremulous voice .
There are long pauses as he struggles for composure .
He tried to pick up Steenkamp but could n't .
He called the emergency services .
He also called some neighbours , the Standers .
"" I was shouting and screaming for him to help me get her to hospital . ""
Pistorius tried to stop the bleeding from Steenkamp 's hip , applying pressure with his hand .
The session has begun .
Pistorius describes entering the toilet and kneeling down over Steenkamp .
Yesterday was the most wrenching moment of the trial yet as Pistorius described the moments leading up to the shooting of Steenkamp .
Half sobbing , half speaking , he said he grabbed the pistol he kept under the bed after hearing the sound of a window sliding in the bathroom .
He said he went to the bathroom , all the while screaming for Steenkamp to call the police .
He described how the couple retired to his bedroom after a quiet evening .
He fell asleep but woke up and brought in two fans from his balcony , then heard a noise , he said .
"" That 's the moment everything changed , "" he told the court .
"" I thought that there was a burglar that was gaining entry to my home . ""
You can read David Smith 's vivid account of the truncated but highly emotional session here .
He raises a key point in his piece .
Many observers following his testimony on Tuesday also questioned why Steenkamp would not have called back to him when he was shouting .
One of the police investigators in the prosecution case told the Guardian there are "" lots of holes "" in his story , adding : "" He should come clean .
He will feel better for it . ""
Pistorius admits shooting Steenkamp through the bathroom door but insists he mistook her for an intruder ."
2014-04-09,"Oscar Pistorius recoiled in horror on the witness stand on Wednesday as a prosecutor showed him a grisly photograph of his dead girlfriend , telling him : "" You shot and killed her .
Wo n't you take responsibility for that ? ""
The Paralympic sprinter went on to claim that he had not intended to kill anyone when he fired four gunshots into a toilet door at his home , but acted out of fear before he had time to think .
The evidence was heard on the day that many observers of South Africa 's biggest murder trial had been waiting for : fierce prosecutor Gerrie Nel 's cross - examination of Pistorius on his claim that he killed girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp by accident last year after mistaking her for an intruder .
But few were prepared for Nel 's all - guns - blazing approach .
To the defence team 's surprise he showed a video , first broadcast on Sky News , of Pistorius firing a gun at a watermelon and saying off - camera : "" It 's a lot softer than brains .
But ... it 's like a zombie stopper . ""
Nel put it to the once celebrated sportsman : "" You know that the same happened to Reeva 's head .
It exploded .
Have a look .
I 'm going to show you , Mr Pistorius , it had the exact same effect , the bullet that went into her head .
"" There were gasps and murmurs in the courtroom as , suddenly without warning , multiple TV screens showed a graphic police photo of Steenkamp 's head , turned to the left with her eyes closed .
There was a gruesome mass of tissue on the back and upper parts and her blonde hair was drenched dark with blood .
But Nel thundered : "" That 's it .
It 's time that you look at it .
Have a look there
, I know you do n't want to because you do n't want to take responsibility . ""
Pistorius , cringing and shielding his eyes from a screen on the witness stand , said through sobs : "" I remember .
I will not look at a picture where I 'm tormented by what I saw and felt that night .
As I picked Reeva up , my fingers touched her head .
I remember .
I do n't have to look at a picture , I was there .
"" As so often in the trial , Pistorius then descended into near hysterical crying , his hands over his face as he rocked from side to side , forcing an adjournment .
His family , sitting in the public gallery , were visibly appalled by Nel 's combative style and shook their heads in disgust .
Defence counsel Barry Roux described the incident as "" uncalled for "" .
Steenkamp 's mother June , however , did not object .
Her lawyer Dup de Bruyn , sitting beside her , explained later : "" Gerrie Nel and I have an agreement where he informs me in advance when photographs are going to be shown
and I tell Mrs Steenkamp to drop her head .
So she did n't see it . ""
Asked if she approved of the photo 's use , De Bruyn replied : "" She has no say .
She ca n't comment on it . ""
The drama followed some electrifying opening exchanges when Nel tore into Pistorius : "" You still are one of the most recognised faces in the world , do you agree ? ...
You are a model for both disabled and able - bodied sportsmen all over the world . ""
Pistorius , careful to keep his eyes fixed on the judge rather than Nel throughout his testimony , replied : "" I think I was my lady .
I 've made a terrible mistake and ... "" Nel interjected fiercely : "" You made a mistake ?
You killed a person , that 's what you did , is n't it ? ""
Pistorius insisted : "" I made a mistake . ""
Nel pressed : "" You killed Reeva Steenkamp , that 's what you did . ""
Pistorius told the judge : "" My mistake was that I took Reeva 's life , my lady . ""
Nel exclaimed : "" You killed her !
You shot and killed her !
Wo n't you take responsibility for that ? ""
Pistorius parried : "" I did , my lady . ""
Like a dog with a bone , Nel went on : ""
Then say it then , say ' Yes , I shot and killed Reeva Steenkamp . '
"" Nel then raised the subject of the athlete 's religious faith and whether he lived by Christian principles . "" I try to , my lady , "" Pistorius responded .
"" I 'm human , I make many faults , I have sins .
I am a Christian because of the reason that I 'm a sinner , the Lord said he came down for the people that had sins .
"" I do n't always think the things I do are right .
But as a Christian , you will not lie .
I will try not to lie my lady , as I said , I 'm human .
I 'm here to tell the truth . ""
As the day wore on Nel went on to aggressively poke holes in details of Pistorius 's version of what happened in the early hours of 14 February last year .
The runner conceded that his claim in a statement a year ago that he went out on to a balcony at his home before the shooting was incorrect .
Pistorius said he went to the edge of the balcony but not outside .
"" My memory is n't very good at the moment , "" he admitted .
"" I 'm under a lot of pressure sitting here .
It 's not easy .
I 'm defending for my life . ""
The pugnacious Nel then questioned Pistorius about the moment he opened fire .
The athlete repeatedly described it as an accident and insisted he had not intended to kill anyone , even an intruder . ""
Before thinking , out of fear , I fired four shots , "" he said .
"" When I realised the scale of what was happening , I stopped firing , and I stood there , and I was in shock .
"" I did n't intend to shoot anyone .
I fired my firearm before I could think , before I even had a moment to comprehend what was happening .
I believed someone was coming out the toilet . ""
At the start of the day , Pistorius described his frantic attempts to revive Steenkamp after he found her the toilet cubicle .
He said : "" I knelt down over Reeva .
She was sitting with her weight on top of the toilet bowl .
I checked to see if she was breathing and she was n't .
"" I pulled her weight on to me and I sat there crying for some time .
I had her head on my left shoulder
and I could feel her blood was running down on me .
I could see that her arm was broken .
I thought I felt her breathing .
She was struggling to breathe . ""
He called an ambulance but it was too late . ""
Reeva had already died whilst I was holding her , before the ambulance arrived , so I knew there was nothing they could do for her . ""
A Pistorius family source said that until the trial he has never been able to get through an account of that night , even with his lawyers . ""
He 's inside it and he keeps getting stuck , "" the source said .
"" It 's the first time we 've heard the whole story . ""
The defence also invited the double - amputee , known as the Blade Runner because of his prosthetic limbs , to walk towards the toilet door , exhibited in the courtroom , and go through the motion of striking it with his cricket bat .
He finished his answers to the defence by saying : "" I did not intend to kill Reeva , my lady , or anyone else .
"" The case continues ."
2014-04-10,"Nel sums up the last stretch of the session on the layout of the room .
He says according to Pistorius the police moved the fans , put the duvet on the floor and opened the curtains wider than they should be .
Pistorius agrees .
The court adjourns .
Here are the key points .
Perhaps not as dramatic as the last two days , Nel spent the morning chipping away at the image of a strong relationship between Pistorius and Steenkamp .
The prosecutor said the relationship was all about him and that he was aggressive and selfish .
On guns , Nel argued that he was negligent , particularly when the Glock went off in the restaurant .
Pistorius said he did not have the finger on the trigger , even though other witnesses said it impossible for such a gun to go off otherwise .
In a key exchange , Nel got Pistorius to admit that "" objectively "" there was no reason to shoot on the fatal night .
This allowed Nel to again argue that Pistorius refuses to accept responsibility for his actions .
The afternoon session was spent on detailed back and forth on where the fans were .
The verdict from the commentators is that it was not a good day for Pistorius , who appeared to fault his legal team as well as the police .
Nel 's verdict of Pistorius ' version of position of the fans .
Various photos of the bedroom are being projected on the monitor showing where the fan was .
Pistorius says the fan could not have been where it is in the photo because that 's where he kept his prostheses .
Earlier Nel asked why Pistorius did not turn on the lights to put them on .
He says his only thought was Steenkamp 's safety .
Nel says Pistorius is lying about closing the curtains , because the fans were in the way .
Pistorius is disputing police evidence showing the fan in front of the curtains .
Nel says the door was open when they were having an argument .
That 's why she ran away screaming .
Defence says there is no evidence of an argument and lodges an objection .
Pistorius said the duvet was on the bed , not on the floor as the police testified .
More back and forth on whether it was on the floor or not .
Pistorius insists it was on the bed .
Pistorius says Steenkamp was under the duvet .
Nel thinks he has caught Pistorius out .
Exclaims Ah ha .
"" You see you are adapting ... you adapting your versions "" .
Pistorius admits that Steenkamp was in the bed when he got up .
Pistorius closed the curtains after bringing in the fans , without any difficulty .
He did n't see her get up .
Nel 's line of questioning if how Pistorius could not have seen Steenkamp get up and out of the bed .
Pistorius said it was pitch black because the curtains were closed
and he did not hear her as the fans were noisy .
Pistorius insists he does n't know when Steenkamp got up .
He woke up because he was hot , he tells the court .
He sat up in bed , Steenkamp asked him whether he could n't sleep .
He brought in the fans and locked the door .
No other conversation .
Balcony light was on .
Nel is trying to determine how dim the room was , because Pistorius said it was very dark just before the shooting .
We are back on the fans , which was discussed yesterday .
Pistorius tells Nel where they were placed .
He was half looking at pictures of homes on Steenkamp 's phone .
He was on his iPad .
Then he told Steenkamp he was falling asleep .
He fell asleep lying on her stomach .
He had asked her to bring in the fans before going to bed .
That was about eight hours before she was killed .
Pistorius does not think she ate again that night .
Steenkamp did yoga exercises , he spoke on the phone to a cousin .
They then brushed their teeth .
He climbed into left hand side of the bed .
Not where he usually slept .
He had a shoulder injury , hence the change .
Court has resumed .
Nel returns to night of fatal shooting . ""
Let 's just try to get to what you can remembers , "" asks Nel .
We begin with events of 13 July .
They had dinner at 7 .
She make chicken stir fry with vegetables .
Here is part of a longer Associated Press story on this morning
The chief prosecutor in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius on Thursday accused the Olympic athlete of egotistical behavior in his relationship with Reeva Steenkamp before he killed her , and described Pistorius ' courtroom apology to his girlfriend 's family as an insincere "" spectacle "" that ignored the feelings of her relatives .
"" Your life is just about you , "" prosecutor Gerrie Nel said on a second day of cross - examination of Pistorius , who fatally shot Steenkamp through a closed toilet cubicle of his home in the early hours of Feb. 14 , 2013 .
Nel asserted that Pistorius was sometimes mean to Steenkamp , pressing him about her objection to him playing a song by American rapper Kendrick Lamar on a car stereo .
Pistorius referred the song in a cellular telephone message to Steenkamp that acknowledged her objections and has been included as evidence in the trial .
The prosecutor asked if the name of the song was "" Bitch , Do n't Kill My Vibe , "" but Pistorius said he could n't remember the specific song .
Nel responded that Steenkamp would have been right to take offense .
A phone message from Steenkamp to Pistorius that was shown in court includes the line : "" You make me happy 90 % of the time
and I think we are amazing together
but I am not some other bitch
you may know trying to kill your vibe .
"" Nel also accused Pistorius of ignoring the concerns of Steenkamp 's family by apologizing to them at the beginning of his testimony this week , rather than seeking to express his condolences in private .
Steenkamp 's mother , June , has attended court sessions this week .
"" Why would you create a spectacle in court , in the public domain , in the public eye , "" Nel said .
"" Why did you put them through this ? ""
Pistorius said his lawyers had been in touch with representatives of Steenkamp 's family , and that he had believed the family of his girlfriend was not ready to meet him .
â€¢ Pistorius admits ' objectively ' there was no reason to shoot â€¢
' I did not mean to pull the trigger ' â€¢ Pistorius accuses witnesses of ' terrible fabrication ' over sunroof shooting Pistorius is choking up .
"" We know objectively you had no reason to shoot , "" says Nel .
"" That 's correct my lady , "" says Pistorius , who says he is getting confused about the line of questioning about whether it 's an accident .
He 's crying and Nel suggests adjourning as the proceedings take an emotional turn . ""
The noise coming from the bathroom made me pull the trigger ...
I heard a noise coming from the toilet
and I discharged the firearm . ""
"" No I did not fire deliberately ...
I fired the gun out of fear .
I did not mean to pull the trigger . ""
Pistorius says he fired in quick succession , he remembers firing at the door .
"" I remember pulling the trigger and rounds going into the door .
"" Nel now moves on to the fatal shooting .
How many shots , he asks .
Four shots , says Pistorius .
In quick succession .
How can you remember it was in quick succession , asks Nel , as he goes back to his previous evidence .
Titters in the courtroom and judge Masipa asks for restraint from the gallery after Nel laughs after Pistorius .
"" You may think it 's entertainment , it 's not , "" says the judge .
Pistorius says the story about his shooting through the sunroof was fabricated , it was a lie , he says .
"" It was a terrible fabrication . ""
Here 's a bit of background on the sunroof incident from Eyewitness News , when Pistorius was questioned by the defence .
Pistorius says it never happened , despite the testimony of his two friends Darren Fresco and Samantha Taylor , an ex - girlfriend .
Pistorius says he carries a gun everywhere for his safety .
After the get - together he and his friends leave .
This is the episode when they were stopped by police for speeding and Pistorius fires a gun through the open sunroof .
Pistorius is showing signs of tetchiness .
Pistorius said he was "" agitated "" by the way the police handled his gun .
"" It was clear he was aggressive , "" says Pistorius .
Now Nel is discussing an incident when Pistorius took his gun to a get - together on a boat .
He says he took the gun with him everywhere .
A loaded firearm on a towel in a boat , Nel points out , is negligent .
"" Why would you leave your gun unattended , is n't that negligent , "" says Nel .
When Pistorius says no , Nel laughs and says you just wo n't accept responsibility .
Pistorius eventually accepts it was negligent .
Pistorius says he kept a magazine at his bedside table for his safety , which Nel says is illegal .
"" I 'm dealing with your negligence as a firearm owner , "" says Nel .
Nel tries to get Pistorius to admit to guilt in keeping his father 's ammunition in his safe .
Pistorius resorts to legalese .
"" It 's not that simple , "" says Pistorius .
Nel skips over different subjects then discusses ammunition that Pistorius keeps in his safe .
His father placed ammunition in his safe , when he was n't there .
Nel asks Pistorius whether Barry Roux , his defence lawyer , told him it was legal for him to have done that .
Pistorius says yes .
Nel says that could not have been the case as it 's illegal .
Nel is now discussing the aftermath of the restaurant incident .
Pistorius says he did not want the story to get into the media because it would have been reported negatively .
Here 's an Andrew Harding tweet about the Glock pistol , the type that went off in the restaurant .
The verdict from one Sky News commentator is that it was not a good day for Pistorius and Nel is succeeding in portraying him as someone who wo n't take responsibility for his actions .
Particularly in maintaining that he had not fired the gun in the Johannesburg restaurant and that it had gone off by itself .
A previous witness for the defence said the gun could not go off without a finger being on the trigger .
Nel resumes questioning on restaurant incident as court resumes .
â€¢ Relationship with Steenkamp was all about him , says Nel â€¢ '
You were humiliating her ' â€¢ Nel accuses Pistorius of refusing to accept responsibility "" I did n't have to think "" says Pistorius about the gun going off .
Nel jumps on this
- we 've heard this before , he says .
Pistorius used the same phrase about the shooting that killed Steenkamp .
The court has adjourned .
Pistorius repeats previous testimony that it had been his fault and offered to pay for the damages .
He says he was disturbed by the incident .
Nel says there is something deeper here , that he 's not willing to accept responsibility for having fired the gun .
Pistorius sticks to the story that his finger was not the trigger .
Wo n't concede that perhaps his finger was on the trigger .
"" You 're blaming everybody but wo n't take responsibility , "" says Nel about the gun incident .
It 's a familiar theme from Nel , echoing his line from yesterday that Pistorius wo n't take responsibility for killing Steenkamp .
Nel persists on the gun incident , saying it was impossible for the gun to go off without Pistorius ' finger on the trigger .
Why did you want to see the firearm , asks Nel .
Pistorius says he was thinking of buying the same model , which was lighter than the one he had .
The gun was being passed to Pistorius by a friend underneath the restaurant table , when it went off .
Pistorius talks at length about guns , prompting Nel to say : "" You know a lot about guns "" .
Nel argues that the gun could not have gone off without Pistorius 's finger on the trigger .
A previous witness said it 's impossible for the gun to go off without a finger on the trigger .
Nel switches tack from the relationship to Pistorius ' not guilty plea to firing of the gun in the restaurant .
Pistorius had the gun but says he did not pull the trigger .
For Nel , this is Pistorius again refusing to accept responsibility .
It was the second time in two weeks that you criticised her in public , says Nel a propos of another argument .
"" I 'm a person too "" said Steenkamp after she was upset .
"" Treat her badly , apologise , smiley face "" .
That 's the pattern of the four - month relationship , says Nel .
Nel is covering a number of seemingly trivial incidents , like when Steenkamp did n't like a CD that was being played in the car .
According to Nel , Pistorius blamed Steenkamp for not bringing it up at the time .
Nel again says : "" It 's all about you "" after another incident in which he was late because he had to pick up her friend .
What was important to her was not important to you , says Nel .
That 's a harsh interpretation , responds Pistorius .
Nel quotes a Steenkamp message , in which she says they are both unhappy .
Nel again goes on the attack .
By brushing her off when she touched your neck in public , telling her to stop chewing gum , you 're humiliating her "" especially in public "" , asserts Nel .
Pistorius says he was trying to help her by telling her not to chew gum .
Nel is trying to show that Pistorius has a temper , screaming not just at Reeva Steenkamp but his previous girlfriend , Samantha Taylor .
So in the first half - hour of the trial , Nel has managed to show that the relationship was not as rosy as Pistorius portrayed for the defence .
"" You do everything to throw tantrums , "" says Nel .
Pistorius says it is an exaggeration .
Nel refers to a "" public scene "" at an engagement party .
Nel picks up a phrase from yesterday , please answer the question .
Nel quotes Steenkamp again : "" I 'm scared of you sometimes "" .
Why would she be scared asks Nel .
Because you shouted at her .
A message flashes on the court monitor as Nel says it shows him "" picking on her "" .
Pistorius denies it , saying they had a good relationship .
"" I never picked on her "" .
Nel keeps going back to Steenkamp 's words in the message - "" You have picked on me incessantly "" since you got back from Cape Town .
The session has started and Nel begins by asking Pistorius about the nature of his relationship with Steenkamp .
How he would describe it in January and February .
Pistorius says it was as good as it was at the "" foundational stage .
"" They had been going out for four months .
Nel says there were arguments in February .
Pistorius insists it was a strong relationship .
Oscar Pistorius can expect further sharp questioning from the chief prosecutor , who urged the athlete to accept responsibility for killing Reeva Steenkamp .
He accused the athlete of lying several times .
In a moment of high drama , the prosecution flashed up a picture of Steenkamp 's bloodied head , on court monitors , drawing gasps from the courtroom .
Nel also started to poke holes in details of Pistorius ' version of the events of the fatal night .
The Paralympian conceded that his claim in a statement a year ago that he went out onto a balcony at his home before the shooting was incorrect .
Pistorius said he went to the edge of the balcony but not outside .
Read the Guardian 's David Smith for his account of yesterday 's events .
The Daily Mirror has an interview with June Steenkamp , Reeva 's mother , who said she "" was unmoved "" by Pistorius ' apology and is haunted by one burning question , is he acting ?
"" â€œI look at Oscar the whole time , to see how he is coping , how he is behaving .
Iâ€ ™ m obsessed with looking at him , itâ€ ™ s just instinctive , I canâ€ ™ t explain it , "" Steenkamp tells the Mirror 's Lucy Thornton .
Pistorius has said he shot his girl friend by accident on Valentine 's day last year , mistaking her for an intruder .
The prosecution alleges he killed her on the early morning by firing through a closed toilet stall door after an argument .
He faces a possible prison term of 25 years to life if convicted of premeditated murder .
A useful background piece is Smith 's article listing key questions Pistorius must address ."
2014-04-10,
2014-04-10,"Oscar Pistorius admitted on Thursday that he had "" no reason "" to fire the shots that killed his girlfriend as a prosecutor called him a liar who consistently fails to accept responsibility for his actions .
The Paralympic sprinter was quizzed about three other gun - related charges , including an incident where he was at a loss to explain how a pistol went off in his hands at a busy restaurant .
The court also heard him portrayed as a narcissistic , bullying boyfriend .
Pistorius is standing trial for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp at his home in Pretoria , South Africa , on Valentine 's day last year .
Under gruelling cross - examination by prosecutor Gerrie Nel , the 27-year - old claimed he thought he was in danger from an intruder but repeatedly denied that he intended to shoot anyone .
"" I did n't have time to think about if I wanted to or did n't want to , "" he told the the high court in Pretoria .
Nel challenged : "" We know for a fact there were no intruders in your house that night , we know for a fact there was no ladder against the wall .
We know for a fact that you had no reason to shoot , objectively speaking . ""
Pistorius told the judge : "" That 's correct , my lady . ""
So why shoot , Nel demanded .
Pistorius explained : "" I heard a noise coming from the toilet that I interpreted as someone coming out to attack me . ""
Nel pressed him : "" Accidentally your fingers pulled the trigger ? ""
When Pistorius agreed , Nel said : "" At the intruder ? ""
Pistorius countered : "" At the door . ""
As Nel became increasingly exasperated , Pistorius broke down , his voice shaking as he reiterated : "" It was an accident . ""
Nel , known as the "" the pitbull "" for his combative approach , had stunned the court on Wednesday by telling to Pistorius to look at a gruesome photograph of his dead girlfriend and take responsibility what he had done .
On Thursday he continued to chip away at both Pistorius 's explanation and his character , circling back and forth from the killing to three other charges that implied a pattern of reckless behaviour with guns .
"" You are a gun enthusiast , "" Nel said .
"" You come from a family with lots of guns .
Fifty or more , I read somewhere ? ""
Pistorius could not confirm the number .
Nel cited an incident at a restaurant in Johannesburg in which a shot went off after a friend of the double - amputee runner passed him a loaded pistol under the table , just weeks before Steenkamp 's death .
Pistorius insisted that he did not have his finger on the trigger when the gun fired .
The prosecutor noted that a police expert had testified that the gun could not be fired without pulling the trigger , and sarcastically described the discharge as a "" miracle "" .
"" The gun went off by itself ? "" he asked .
Pistorius was adamant : "" I know that my finger was not on the trigger . ""
An incredulous Nel went on : "" We have you in possession of the gun , a shot went off , but you did n't discharge the gun ? ...
I 'm putting it to you , you fired that gun .
There is no other way .
You are lying . ""
Pistorius replied : "" I respect Mr Nel 's comment , but I did n't pull the trigger on that firearm .
I did n't pull the trigger .
I did n't have time to think .
"" Nel mimicked him with sarcasm : "" I 'm a gun enthusiast , I did n't have time to think .
"" Later the prosecutor brought up an allegation made by two witnesses that Pistorius fired a gun through the open sunroof of a car in which he was travelling .
The "" blade runner "" claimed that both witnesses had "" fabricated "" the story .
Nel also grilled Pistorius on a charge that he had rounds of .38-caliber ammunition in a safe at his home without a licence .
Pistorius has pleaded not guilty and said it was his father 's ammunition , put there for "" safe keeping "" .
The prosecutor said Pistorius 's father , Henke , had "" refused "" to make a statement to police regarding whether the ammunition belonged to him .
Pistorius commented that he has a distant relationship with his father , who was present at his bail hearing last year but has not been seen at his trial .
Staring at the accused , Nel told him : "" You are lying .
You just do n't want to accept responsibility for anything . ""
He also forced Pistorius to admit that he sometimes illegally left a magazine of bullets in his bedside table , including on 13 February 2013 .
As the cross - examination returned to that evening and the following morning , Pistorius was tested on his claim that after he shot Steenkamp , he ran out onto the balcony and screamed for help .
In a police picture shown to the court , a duvet and a large stand - up electrical fan clearly block his route to the balcony door .
Pistorius claimed the police moved these items when they arrived at the scene .
Nel responded : "" Let 's sum up : A policeman moved the two fans , put the duvet on the floor , opened the curtains wider than they should be before the photographs were taken . ""
Your version is so improbable , that nobody would ever think it 's reasonably , possibly true , it 's so impossible ...
Your version is a lie . ""
He added : "" When you got up you had an argument .
That 's why she ran away screaming .
"" Earlier the prosecutor referred to WhatsApp messages between Pistorius and Steenkamp that he said showed the athlete to be egotistial and self - centred , with concerns "" all about Oscar "" .
When Nel asked about a message in which Steenkamp said she was sometimes "" scared "" of her boyfriend , Pistorius explained : "" She 's scared of the feelings that she has for me and the way that I brushed her off . ""
Nel said the phrase "" I love you "" appeared only twice and , on both occasions , they were written by Steenkamp to her mother . ""
Never to you and you never to her , "" Nel said .
Pistorius responded : "" I never got the opportunity to tell Reeva that I loved her . ""
In another message Steenkamp objected to Pistorius playing a song by American rapper Kendrick Lamar on a car stereo .
The prosecutor asked if the name of the song was "" Bitch , Do n't Kill My Vibe , "" adding that Steenkamp would have been right to take offence , but "" we ca n't ask her . ""
Nel summarised : "" Because it 's all about Mr Pistorius , that is what your relationship was . ""
He also accused Pistorius of ignoring the concerns of Steenkamp 's family by apologising to them at the beginning of his testimony this week instead of doing so in private .
"" Why would you create a spectacle in court , in the public domain , in the public eye , "" Nel said .
"" Why did you put them through this ? ""
Pistorius said his lawyers had been in touch with representatives of Steenkamp 's family , and he had believed the family of his girlfriend was not ready to meet him .
"" I completely understand where they 're coming from , "" he said .
"" It 's not that I have n't thought about them . ""
But Nel , in a recurring theme , said : "" Your life is just about you ...
You will blame anybody but yourself ...
You see again Mr Pistorius
, it 's the strangest day today , you do n't take responsibility for anything . """
2014-04-10,"The mother of Reeva Steenkamp , the woman shot dead by Oscar Pistorius , has told the Mirror the Olympic athlete has been transformed from hero to devil in South Africa since he killed her daughter .
Speaking during Pistorius 's trial for murder in Pretoria , June Steenkamp told the paper : "" He has an aggressive persona , he 's used to having people adore him , so it must be pretty different for him now .
He 's been spoilt by other people , that 's why he struts around and looks superior .
He 's gone from hero to devil . ""
Steenkamp , 67 , said she is still trying to decide whether the sprinter is acting as he defends himself against the murder charge .
"" I look at Oscar the whole time , to see how he is coping , how he is behaving .
I 'm obsessed with looking at him , it 's just instinctive , I ca n't explain it .
I keep thinking : ' Let me see how he 's taking this . ' ""
He has been very dramatic , the vomiting and crying .
I think he 's just about keeping himself together .
I do n't know whether he 's acting .
Most of the time he 's on his cell phone or looking down at papers or writing notes , "" she told the Mirror .
Reeva Steenkamp , 29 , was shot dead by Pistorius in their home last year .
He said he mistook her for an intruder .
June Steenkamp did not meet her daughter 's boyfriend until they met in court .
"" He did eventually look at me .
My presence unnerves him , I 'm sure of it .
He 's answerable to me .
He looked at me and said : ' Good morning , Mrs Steenkamp . '
I never answered , I just nodded my head . ""
I do n't know the man .
All I know is what he 's done .
He must see me there in the court , he must feel my eyes boring into him , I think it makes a lot of difference .
"" I do look at him too much , maybe .
I like to see how he is reacting .
I can see him very clearly , even without my glasses –
he 's the only one I can see ,
he 's right in front of me , "" she said .
Pistorius , 27 , apologised for the death of Steenkamp when he took the stand in Pretoria this week
but it did not convince June Steenkamp .
Speaking about the apology , she said : "" It left me unmoved .
I knew it was coming .
My lawyers had prepared me for it .
I cried for the first time : ' Yes ' , but not because he apologised , because of the suffering and agony that my darling daughter went through and because I will never have her again . ""
Steenkamp has heard harrowing descriptions of her daughter 's last moments and injuries and has seen photographs of her dead body during the trial .
She said that she feels helpless when she hears about her daughter 's last moments . ""
It haunts me , "" she said .
"" We could n't help her .
We could n't do anything .
I imagine how she must have been in terror and pain and suffering , devastated by what was going on .
"" I relive that scene in the bathroom
and it 's changed me so much , made me harder .
My daughter is dead .
He killed her .
He shot her till she was dead in that toilet , in that bathroom , so how am I ever going to feel better about it ?
"" she said .
The prosecution has rested its case against Pistorius and the athlete has begun to outline his defence ."
2014-04-11,"After a meandering first half , the last hour was riveting as prosecutor Gerrie Nel took the court through the moments of the shooting , when Pistorius fired at what he thought was an intruder .
Nel kept questioning the plausibility of Pistorius ' account .
Why head towards danger rather go through to the balcony with Steenkamp and away from it .
As for the moments just before Pistorius fired four shots , Nel said he would never convince the court that Steenkamp would not have responded if he had been shouting and screaming just three metres away .
Nel says Pistorius must have known Steenkamp was behind the door .
It 's the only version of events that makes sense . ""
In fact you knew Reeva was behind the door and you shot at her ..
it 's the only thing that makes sense "" , says Nel .
The court adjourns at this emotional high - point until Monday , rather than resuming after lunch .
Pistorius says he thought he heard the sound of the toilet door opening .
"" I thought someone was coming out to attack me . ""
Nel is relentless now .
"" You can not get away with this again and again , "" says Nel .
Roux intervenes on the timing of the shots , giving time for Pistorius to recover .
"" She would have responded , "" says Nel , if Pistorius was shouting and screaming three metres away .
Long silence as Nel asks whether Steenkamp screamed after first shot .
Pistorius says she did n't scream .
But he also says the shots were so loud that screams would not have been heard .
Nel says people heard a woman scream during the shots "" She was n't scared on anything except you , "" says Nel .
Pistorius whispers : "" That 's not true . ""
Pistorius ' voice breaks again .
Pistorius says he assumed the intruder had gone into the toilet after he heard the door slam .
Pistorius says he was quiet around the bathroom area because he did not want to give his position away . ""
He says he wanted to make the intruder flee .
Nel picks up on key evidence .
He wonders why Steenkamp would not respond if he she was in the toilet , three metres away , when Pistorius was shouting .
"" There is no way you would convince the court that she would say nothing .. she would have responded .
"" Pistorius has to own up to a mistake after denying that he had said he heard someone kick the door .
He had .
"" It 's a lie , "" says Nel bluntly about Pistorius ' account of him heading towards danger .
"" Nobody does that , "" insists Nel .
Pistorius describes how he was shouting and screaming , but then went quiet as he approached the bedroom .
Then he heard a door close , and became sure that someone was in the house .
He peered round the corner into the bathroom and did n't see anybody .
He saw the toilet door was closed .
It usually is open .
Pistorius insists he went to the danger area to put as much distance between the danger and Steenkamp .
Nel says they could have left by the main bedroom door to the balcony .
That was the way to safety .
"" You have to explain why you did n't take Reeva through the bedroom door to safety ...
You approached the danger .
It does n't make sense , "" says Nel .
Pistorius says he does n't cower , that 's his personality .
Nel says Pistorius could have had a view of the passageway of about five metres .
He says Pistorius ' version is improbably and does n't make sense .
"" If find your instinct strange .
Instinct one is to make sure Reeva was safe , "" says Nel Nel asks why Pistorius headed toward danger .
Why did he not stay in the room .
Pistorius said if he stayed in the room anything could have happened .
These are the day 's most riveting exchanges .
When you walked down the passage , the gun was pointing at the bathroom , says Nel .
Pistorius said he was screaming and shouting as he entered the passage way .
"" I was screaming for the persons to get out and for Reeva to call the police ... there was no response from Reeva . ""
What was your intention , asks Nel .
Pistorius refuses to say that he was ready to shoot to take someone 's life .
He wanted to protect Steenkamp and himself .
Pistorius says there 's a massive difference between wanting to shoot and being ready to act .
"" I was not ready to shoot , "" says Pistorius after Nel says he went to the passage with his gun .
Nel says there were a lot of other options rather than Pistorius grabbing the gun , like going to the balcony , or on the side of Steenkamp 's side of the bed with a view with of the passage leading to the bathroom .
Nel says Pistorius ' version is implausible because the first thing a couple would do when hearing a noise in the night would be to have a conversation .
"" You did not find out whether she was scared , "" says Nel , or whether she had heard him .
Court is back after 10-minute break .
Pistorius says he was on his stump as he got the gun .
Then he told Steenkamp to get down and call the police .
He wanted to put himself between people in the bathroom and Steenkamp .
Nel says he invented a discussion with her .
"" I 've never invented anything , "" says Pistorius .
The athlete maintains he thought she was next to him .
Nel asks Pistorius why he is getting emotional . ""
Because I lost the person I cared about , "" says Pistorius , who can be heard crying .
Judge says witness is clearly in distress so the court adjourns .
Now we 're back on the fans , and the length of the cords .
Screen zooms in fans at side of the bed .
Lots of discussion on where the fans were because they could have obstructed Pistorius ' path to balcony .
The pictures show them blocking access to balcony , but Pistorius says they have been moved since night of killing .
Pistorius grudgingly accepts that this would be so .
He maintains that Steenkamp 's jeans were next to duvet .
Nel : if jeans are top of duvet there would be a problem for Pistorius ' version .
Barry Roux for the defence disputes that picture shows jeans on top of duvet .
Nel says he wants to base his questioning that jeans are on top of duvet .
Judge asks Nel to proceed .
Enlarged picture of jeans on the duvet is shown on court monitors .
Court is back .
â€¢ Judge asks Pistorius whether he 's too tired to carry on â€¢ Pistorius admits making mistakes , but not from tiredness â€¢ Alarm system was on the night of shooting Judge Masipa asks Nel to mind his language after he called Pistorius a liar and the court adjourns .
Nel returns to location of fans and duvet .
Pistorius insists police moved evidence around .
Nel asks rhetorically : so the police must have moved the duvet on to the floor , opened the curtains , switched on the light .
Pistorius say he does n't know why the police would have moved things around .
Roux intervenes to say photos can be misleading because of misperception .
"" On the morning of the 14th I was sure of what I heard .
I told Reeva to call the police .
Get down and call the police , "" says Pistorius .
Some surreal discussion of the difference between speaking in a soft manner and a whisper .
"" I was frozen for a couple of second then I rushed to get my firearm next to the pedestal , then I got my firearm ... told Reeva to call the police ...
I whispered to her .
I did not look at her .
I did not discuss the noise with her . ""
Nel wonders why Pistorius did not ask Reeva "" did you hear that "" Then he heard a window slide open , despite the noise of the fans .
Pistorius says the noise of the window sliding and hitting the frame would have been louder than the fans .
Irritation creeps into Pistorius ' voice as he says picture shown on screen monitor showing location of large and small fans are incorrect .
We 're back on the fans .
Pistorius ' voice becomes tremulous again .
He brought in the fans from the balcony into the bedroom when he heard the noise .
There is discussion of how much light there is the bedroom .
Pistorius says there was enough light to see a silhouette of the jeans .
He was bothered by a blue LCD light .
Nel moves back to the night of 13 Feb. He does jump around .
Ca n't be easy to have to keep up with frequent change of subjects .
All this seems rather tangetial to the Steenkamp shooting , but it 's all part of Nel 's attempt to chip away at Pistorius ' credibility .
Now Pistorius , unbidden , talks about why he got assaulted .
Nel says you go looking for trouble .
So that 's why Nel is bringing this all up .
Pistorius was angry at Van der Burgh for talking Taylor abroad while he was at the Olympics .
A bit of an exchange on why Pistorius does n't trust the police .
Now we switch to 2012 incident when Pistorius said he was assaulted .
The prelude to the altercation when Pistorius confronted a TV producer , Quinton Van der Burgh , over Samantha Taylor , the woman the athlete was going out with .
Pistorius speaks at length about the whole episode .
Pistorius said he did not report the incident to the police because he did not have any confidence in them .
The incident happened in 2008 - 09 .
Pistorius talks more confidently now , seems on firmer ground than discussing details of his alarm system .
But Nel pounces again , when Pistorius says he ca n't remember who he phoned after the incident to come pick him up .
Nel accuses the athlete of making it all up , which is why he does n't remember who he called .
Nel switches from the alarm to an incident on the highway , where Pistorius claims someone in another car shot at him .
He said he saw a muzzle flash and heard a bang .
Is this to keep Pistorius off - balance ?
It seems Nel is trying to get across to the judge that the alarm would have gone off if somebody had got into the house .
Nel says if you 're tired , we 'll have discussions with your legal team .
Pistorius chokes up .
Nel is relentless .
"" I 'm not convinced , I think you 're trying to cover a lie . ""
Judge Masipa asks whether Pistorius is too tired to carry on .
Is he making mistakes , because he is tried , she asks .
"" I was not aware of any malfunction of my alarm in 2013 , "" says Pistorius , who says he deactivated it before going downstairs to open the door .
Nel seizes on this saying , saying he is changing the evidence as he goes along .
Pistorius says he is tired which is why he is making mistakes .
Nel says Pistorius gave no evidence about anybody working on tampering on alarm in 2013 .
"" it 's not that easy , "" says Pistorius , who wonders why his defence Barry Roux did not ask him about it .
Nel is chipping away at Pistorius early .
Pistorius also says the painters could have taken off the sensors , which happened in 2012 .
Nel accuses Pistorius of changing his evidence on the alarm .
"" You 're getting deeper into trouble , "" says Nel .
But the athlete adds a caveat ...
Pistorius says he was seldom at his home because of his extensive travel .
Nel asks him to explain the alarm system .
Pistorius says the alarm was activated inside and outside on that night .
The chief prosecutor , Gerrie Nel , questions Pistorius about his not going to the police despite being burgled , when he lived at another location .
But no burglaries at Silver Woods , where he was living at the time of the shooting ( except when police stole his watches , he tells the court ) .
Nel is trying to get across that Silverwoods was a very safe location .
Day three of the cross examination is about to start , about nine minutes late .
This tweet from the BBC 's Pumza Fihlani gives an idea of the blanket coverage the trial is getting in South Africa
It 's been a tough week for Oscar Pistorius as chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel came out guns blazing .
He has sought to portray the athlete as selfish and aggressive , who publicly humiliated Steenkamp on several occasions .
Nel also sought to portray the athlete as not just obsessed with guns but negligent , particularly when a gun he was handling under a restaurant table went off .
Pistorius refused to acknowledge that he pulled the trigger prompting Nel to say that this was typical of his inability to take responsibility for his actions .
When the court adjourned yesterday Nel was questioning the runner how he could not have seen Steenkamp when he got up to move the fans .
You can read David Smith 's account of yesterday 's events here .
Pistorius , 27 , says Steenkamp 's death was an accident after he mistook her for an intruder and fired four times with his licensed 9 mm pistol through a toilet door .
Prosecutors say he intended to kill the 29-year - old after a loud argument heard by witnesses and charged him with premeditated murder for which he faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted ."
2014-04-11,
2014-04-13,"The world 's most famous murder suspect , Oscar Pistorius , returns to the witness box on Monday to face further gruelling cross - examination , amid signs that public sympathy is swinging away from him in favour of his chief tormentor .
The Paralympic athlete faces hours , and possibly days , more grilling by state prosecutor Gerrie Nel over the killing of his girlfriend inside a toilet cubicle at his home in Pretoria , South Africa .
Pistorius , who claims he panicked because he thought there was an intruder , is likely to be asked why Reeva Steenkamp locked herself in the toilet , how he fired by "" accident "" , not once but four times , and what happened in the immediate aftermath , when he broke down the door with a cricket bat .
The emotionally fragile Pistorius , 27 , admitted making mistakes during his testimony last week and also lost ground in the court of Twitter opinion , where Nel has become something of a star .
Eusebius McKaiser , an influential author and broadcaster with 57,000 followers , tweeted : "" Nel just nailed it .
If Reeva was n't scared she 'd have said something to Oscar and not be [ sic ] quiet behind the door as he shouts . ""
When McKaiser did an impression of Nel on his radio show , cross - examining callers who pretended to be Pistorius , it was indicative of how the trial has become a cultural phenomenon , bringing offices to a standstill and colonising swaths of the internet .
Blanket TV and radio coverage is turning Nel and his opposite number , defence counsel Barry Roux , into reluctant celebrities , with their names attached to satirical Twitter accounts , their faces caricatured by cartoonists , their words spun into spoof rap songs .
Zelda la Grange , former personal assistant to Nelson Mandela , tweeted last week : "" In my next life I want to marry a Barry Roux or a Gerrie Nel .
I put it out there …
To the Universe …
"" The legal jousting can sometimes look like public entertainment .
Both men are seasoned court operators but neither is using his first language , Afrikaans , since English dominates the judiciary and public life here .
For the first month of the trial , Roux hogged the limelight as he rattled state witnesses .
His favoured phrase , "" I put it to you "" , became an unstoppable meme .
One website even produced a list of "" The top 10 Barry Roux parodies "" .
Questioning a neighbour about the night Steenkamp died , he said : "" Maybe you and your wife should have stood together in the witness box . ""
This led the judge , Thokozile Masipa , to ask him : "" Are n't you going a bit far ? ""
At that stage Nel was content to take a back seat .
Observers said he was too casual , perhaps half - hearted .
That changed last week in an explosion of withering questions , laser - like attention to detail and a savaging of Pistorius worthy of a hound deliberately starved of meat .
Nel , nicknamed "" the pitbull "" , is diminutive and pugnacious and a sharp contrast to the tall , silver - haired , urbane Roux .
At times , it can feel like a street fighter squaring up to a boxer .
But both have eviscerated witnesses in what has provided a startling education in the perils of giving evidence in a court of law .
"" Roux was rude and obnoxious with the state witnesses , so it 's a case of getting your own back , "" said Laurie Pieters - James , an independent criminologist who has attended the trial .
"" Roux was sarcastic and belittling : ' You are in some way inferior to me . '
Gerrie Nel 's approach is different .
He 's directly attacking : ' You are lying . '
He 's much more direct in going for the jugular .
"" Nel 's no - holds - barred approach has earned him a fan base , with some South Africans joking that they would like him to negotiate their lobola , a dowry traditionally paid in cattle . ""
Death Nel for Oscar ? "" asked one headline .
But on Friday , Masipa warned him : "" Mind your language , Mr Nel .
You do n't call the witness a liar , not while he is in the witness box . ""
Beyond the courtroom , however , both men guard their privacy .
They are "" very congenial , caring people , "" said Pieters - James .
"" Remember they are playing a part .
They are characters in a court of law tasked with a job .
I do n't think we 've seen any of their true selves and they 're used to this image built around them
– it must be unsettling for them . ""
Nel has repeatedly set traps for Pistorius that have forced him to implicitly blame Roux for making mistakes .
But Pieters - James denied there is a needling rivalry . ""
In court , it 's mostly adversarial .
I 've seen them [ exchange ] a friendly smile and comment outside .
There is not a score being settled . ""
Roux was called to the Johannesburg bar in 1982 .
His clients have included Dave King , a former Rangers football club director accused of tax evasion .
It is rumoured that Roux is earning 50,000 rand ( £ 2,800 ) a day , a bill that has forced Pistorius to put his house up for sale .
Nel has claimed major scalps in three decades as a prosecutor , including that of Jackie Selebi , a former anti - apartheid activist who became the country 's top police officer and later president of Interpol .
Nel called him an "" arrogant liar "" and secured his conviction for corruption .
During the case , Nel was arrested in front of his family in the early hours by 20 police officers – fraud charges were later dropped .
He earns about 1.3 m rand a year .
A legal source , who did not wish to be named , said : "" If you ask , ' is his cross - examination style unique to Oscar Pistorius ? ' , the answer is no .
That 's how he 's always been .
People say he goes for the jugular , but he 's got points to make
and he makes them .
He 's not shy .
""
The source said Nel had no regrets about displaying the graphic police photo of Steenkamp after her death and could introduce more : "" It was to show Pistorius the evidence .
He blew out her brains and he 's been vomiting into a bucket , but can he please look at what he did ?
You show the accused the evidence and the postmortem in every case –
it 's just that this one has more attention . ""
Another high court - based source said Nel was a thick - skinned loner who did not care about being popular . ""
He 's a quiet guy .
There are only two things in his life : right and wrong .
There 's no maybe . ""
Nel kept Selebi on the witness stand for two weeks , so it is uncertain how much longer Pistorius will have to roll with his punches .
Some say that if this were a boxing match , the referee would have stepped in long ago .
Sitting in the witness box , with its six microphones , swivel chair with red - spotted yellow cushion and green bucket lest he throw up again , the one - time Olympic hero often looks like the most tired , lonely man in the world .
"" My life is on the line , "" Pistorius whined defensively last week .
"" Reeva does n't have a life any more , "" Nel barked back . ""
Because of what you 've done , she 's not alive any more .
So please , listen to the questions and give us the truth . """
2014-04-14,"Oscar Pistorius has finished his fourth day of bruising cross examination .
The athlete seems to be changing his ground , switching back and forth as to whether he fired in self - defence or by accident .
Nell began the day by saying that he would set out to prove that the athlete 's version of the shooting on Valentine 's day last year was so improbable that it was untrue .
Pistorius broke down a couple of times , but when pressed insisted that he did not fire at Steenkamp .
"" I did not fire at Reeva ...
I did not intend to fire at the door . ""
After shouting three times on the balcony , the athlete comes back into the bedroom and puts his prostheses on .
It normally takes him less than 30 seconds .
Nel wonders why he did not switch on the lights .
He ran back to the toiler and tried to shoulder charge the door .
He took the gun with him .
It does n't sound rational , Pistorius admits , but he says he was not in rational state of mind .
Nel wants to adjourn before asking about the toilet door .
The judge agrees .
Pistorius remembers screaming for help as loudly as he could on the balcony .
Nel asks how Pistorius could unlock and open the sliding doors with a cocked gun in his right hand .
Nel asks why Pistorius is getting emotional when he is being asked about the cocked gun .
"" You 're not using your emotional state to escape ? "" asks Nel .
Nel wonders why Pistorius takes the leap from shooting an intruder to thinking he had shot Steenkamp .
Pistorius says that thought occurred to him when he did not see Steenkamp on the bed .
Nel wonders why Pistorius did not check the ladder ( the way the intruders came in ) .
Nel pounces as Pistorius says he ran to check on the balcony .
Why did you spontaneously say so , asks Nel , who again accuses Pistorius of tailoring the evidence .
Nel asked why Pistorius he did not check about the bedroom door .
If she was not behind the curtain , the next place would have been to check the bedroom door .
"" Nothing was normal that night , "" says Pistorius as Nel asks him why he did n't check the bedroom the door .
The last he saw of Steenkamp was when she was in bed .
Pistorius 's voice is a mixture of anguish and impatience at the questioning from Nel as he asks him how he is checking where his girlfriend was in the room after the shooting .
Immediately after he fired he shouted out for Steenkamp .
He was shouting because he was still scared .
Then he got to the bed and realised she was not there , he tried to feel the curtains to see whether she was hiding there .
He began to panic and headed back to the bathroom and screamed for her .
He put his shoulder to the toilet door and tried to rip it open .
He ran back on his stumps to the sliding door to shout for help .
All this through sobs .
"" Before I could make sense of the situation I fired four shots . ""
Nel asks Pistorius how he was holding his gun .
Pistorius says it was not a normal shooting position .
Shoulder height but arm not extended .
"" You thought the intruder was coming out , "" asks Nel .
"" That is correct , my lady . ""
Pistorius says he could see the outline of the door handle .
Nel asks again , did you intend to shoot the intruder .
"" I blame myself for taking Reeva 's life . ""
Earlier Pistorius said : "" I fired because I got a fright .
I never intended to shoot anyone . ""
"" Mr Pistorius this is not good for you , "" Nel says of the athlete 's account .
Nel does this a lot , commenting on how Pistorius is digging a bigger hole for himself .
The implication from Pistorius 's account is that Steenkamp went to the bathroom unbeknownst to him as he was bringing the fans in from the balcony to the bathroom .
Nel asked Pistorius what would happen when he fired through the door .
"" I do n't know , "" replies the athlete .
Nel asks why he did n't fire a warning shot down the passage .
Same reply .
If Reeva had gone to the toilet , why did she not switch on the light .
Because she had her cell phone .
Nel pounces .
A cellphone light would have shown up .
"" You would have seen "" says Nel .
Pistorius says he had his back turned .
Before the court restarts , here 's part of an Associated Press account of the morning session .
The chief prosecutor in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius on Monday accused him of tailoring his version of how he killed his girlfriend to fit evidence at the scene , exhaustively alleged inconsistencies in the athlete 's account of the fatal shooting of Reeva Steenkamp .
The court temporarily adjourned late in the morning after the double - amputee runner started to sob while testifying about the moments before he killed Steenkamp in his home in the early hours of Feb. 14 , 2013 .
Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel had asked him what exactly he shouted as he moved toward the bathroom where he shot Steenkamp , who was behind a closed door in the toilet cubicle .
Pistorius said he thought there was an intruder in the house .
After a long pause after the question , he said he screamed , using an expletive , for the purported intruder to get out of his house .
As he testified , Pistorius began to wail and Judge Thokozile Masipa called an adjournment .
Just over an hour later and after court resumed , Pistorius again broke down when replying to a question on why he had opened fire , causing a second adjournment .
The prosecution has said Pistorius ' account of a mistaken shooting is a lie .
Nel opened the fourth day of cross - examination by alleging thatPistorius had "" concocted "" his account of the shooting . ""
You 're tailoring your version as you 're sitting there , "" Nel said .
Later , he accused Pistorius of being a stickler for detail on some matters , in contrast to his frequent statements on the witness stand that he could not remember aspects of his testimony .
Nel noted that Pistorius earlier said he warned Steenkamp to call police about an intruder in a whisper , contradicting later testimony that he spoke in a "" low tone "" and the prosecutor also said blood spatter evidence indicated that the athlete 's statement about the location of a duvet in the bedroom was false .
â€¢ Pistorius seems to be changing argument from self - defence to accident â€¢ ' I did not intend to fire ' â€¢ Nel : ' I 'm going to show your version is not true ' "" I did not intend to fire the gun , "" says Pistorius , as he raises his voice in anger and frustration at Nel .
At this point the court adjourns for lunch .
The judge asks to see both lawyers .
The defence has said that Pistorius has a high - pitched voice that makes his screams sound like a woman 's .
Pistorius says he never screamed like the way he did that night .
It was screaming , shouting and crying .
"" I fired in quick succession , "" says Pistorius .
"" Why did you stop ... why only four .
Why not empty the magazine ? "" asks Nel .
"" I do n't know , "" replies Pistorius .
"" My voice is the only voice screaming that night , "" says Pistorius .
Neighbours in Pistorius 's gated testimony testified they heard a woman 's "" blood curdling "" screams , dying away after the final gunshot .
Pistorius says it was his screams between the shots .
"" You never gave them the chance to get out of the toilet ...
You just fired , "" says Nel .
"" That 's correct , my lady , "" replies Pistorius .
Toilet door with four bullet holes is shown in court .
Nel focuses on the noise Pistorius said he heard .
The athlete says in retrospect he heard the sound of a magazine rack in the toilet moving .
This is new .
Nel asks whether Pistorius screamed before the noise of the door .
"" I shouted : ' get out . ' "" Pistorius asks for time and says yes that 's correct .
Nel : "" Would that have caused Reeva to respond . ""
Answer : "" I do n't think so .
"" You never said : "" I 'm armed , I 'm going to shoot . ""
Pistorius says he did not want to warn whoever was in the toilet .
"" They might react more violently , "" says Pistorius .
The BBC 's Andrew Harding points to this useful piece by Professor James Grant on the different defence arguments Pistorius can use .
We are back in court .
Roux says Nel is going over the same ground too much , which is why Pistorius is getting emotional .
Nel says Pistorius is getting emotional because he is getting his defences mixed up .
Pistorius 's voice quivers .
"" I was n't aiming at the door ... my eyes were going between the door and the window . ""
"" I was pointing at the door . ""
"" I did n't have time to think , "" says Pistorius .
Nel says now at this instant , he was n't thinking .
Pistorius is struggling .
Nel : "" Is it your defence that you fired at the perceived attacker , "" asks Nel .
"" I fired at the door , "" comes the reply .
"" I fired out of fear , "" says Pistorius .
"" I heard this noise , I thought someone was coming to attack
and I fired .
""
Nel says Pistorius is changing his defence because he knew he was firing at Reeva .
"" I did not fire at Reeva , "" wails Pistorius and the court adjourns .
Nel is pressing Pistorius when he says he ca n't explain why he had not mentioned the door shutting before .
Nel says it 's because Pistorius is making things up as he goes along .
Pistorius says he was afraid someone might shoot at him through open bathroom window or that somebody might come from the toilet and shoot him .
He thought he heard the toilet door open .
"" I could see the door .. I fired before the door move . ""
Nel jumps on this .
So you fired before you saw the door or handle move , asks Nel .
Pistorius said he heard the door slam shut as he was screaming and shouting .
He was convinced it was the toilet door .
"" I thought somebody had gone inside or had come out and shut the door , "" he says .
Nel says there was nothing about the door shutting in the bail testimony and yet it was so significant .
Why asks Nel -
it 's because you invented it .
Pistorius says he kept his fiream close to him , so no one could grab it .
"" I had the firerarm in front of me , "" says Pistorius .
Discussion of how far it was in front , whether his arm was bent .
Pistorius describes approaching the bathrooom .
"" There was enough light in the bathroom , "" he says .
He peered into the bathroom , checking to see whether there was anyone to ambush him .
He moved backwards to where the toilet was and he started screaming again .
Nel says Pistorius forgot about the door slamming .
Pistorius says it slammed long before he reached the bathroom .
Now there 's argument about when the door slammed .
We 're back in court .
Nel is asking Pistorius about the immediate moments before the shooting .
Pistorius tells the court is screaming at Steenkamp to call the police .
The athlete 's voice is trembling .
Nel says Pistorius ' version is not making sense .
Aimee Pistorius rushed over to her brother when he broke down in the witness stand .
The adjournment was longer than first thought , but should be resuming very soon .
â€¢ Nel : ' Your version is so improbable ..
Your version is untrue . '
â€¢ ' I screamed - get the fuck of my house ! '
â€¢ Court adjourns after athlete breaks down As Pistorius moved down the passageway he was shouting at intruders to get out of the house and for Steencamp to call the police .
A brief adjournment as Pistorius gets emotional after he told the court he screamed : "" Get the fuck out of my house "" Pistorius said he froze immediately after hearing the noise then ran to get his fiream from under his bed , turned body back to the passage , told Steenkamp to get down and call the police .
He then went down the passage , his firearm in front on him , but not extended like when he was firing at the watermelon .
Nel is alleging that the noise of the window opening is "" evidence tailoring "" .
Even Nel is being corrected by Pistorius on details eg as window slamming against the frame rather than another window , Nel manages to make Pistorius look bad .
"" You 're tailoring the evidence , "" Nel says not for the first time .
Nel asks Pistorius why Steenkamp did not ask him why he was getting up , apart from why he could n't sleep .
Now Nel moves to the noises .
Pistorius says the first noise he heard was the window sliding open . ""
The noise was loud , "" says Pistorius .
Nel says it was improbable that Pistorius did not ask Steenkamp about the noise .
Pistorius says he can see blood spatter on the carpet , when asked by Nel , who says it came from Pistorius carrying Steenkamp 's body . ""
As you argue , I get more questions , "" says Nel as they go back and forth on the position of the duvet .
Pistorius says it was on the bed .
This is about whether police moved items about in the bedroom .
Now Pistorius is asked how he spoke to Steenkamp when he heard a noise .
He says "" in a low tone "" .
Nel goes to previous evidence where Pistorius said he had whispered to Steenkamp .
Nel asserts that Pistorius wants to avoid "" whisper "" because that means that Steenkamp may not have heard .
Pistorius sounds very weary , which is hardly surprising as this is his fourth day of cross examination .
Pause , as Nel seeks to retrieve some evidence .
Chance for Pistorius to get a breather .
Nel apologises for the delay .
He buys time asking about whether TV had a red light .
Pistorius says it did n't bother him .
Now it 's back to the duvet as Nel asks "" let 's see if we can see blood spatters there "" .
Picture of Pistorius 's stereo flashes up on monitor screens .
Pistorius says there are lots of other lights on the amp .
If the lights were bright , why not not switch off the amp .
Pistorius says he does n't remember why he did n't switch it off .
He insists he wanted to cover the blue light with the jeans .
We return to the blue LED light on the amplifier , which Pistorius was only source of light in otherwise pitch black room .
Pistorius says he used Steenkamp 's jeans to cover the light .
Nel says blue light indicates the amp was on .
If it had been off , there would have been a red light .
This goes to Nel 's contention that the couple were awake and not asleep before the shooting .
Nel returns to the state of the room , open curtain , position of the fans .
Pistorius disputes state 's assertion .
The New Yorker 's Amy Davidson on Pistorius and guns : "" Guns behave strangely in Pistoriusâ€ ™ s hands .
As he tells it , they have an eerie autonomy .
"" Nel refers to a witness saying she heard a woman 's voice about 2 am . ""
Arguing is not good for your case , "" says Nel .
Pistorius says they ate after 7 and went to bed .
Nel says evidence shows that Steenkamp ate later .
Pistorius says unlikely she ate after the 7 pm dinner , but Nel says evidence shows athlete 's version is impossible .
According to Pistorius dinner would have finished well before 8 pm .
Pistorius restates that he slept on the left because of a sore shoulder .
Nel says the jeans are out of place because she wanted to leave .
Why are they out if everything else was in her bag , the prosecutor asks .
Nel says the state 's case is that Steenkamp wanted to leave and that they were n't sleeping , they had an argument .
"" That 's not true , "" says Pistorius .
Nel says evidence show Steenkmap must have eaten up to two hours before her death .
Judge Thokozile Masipa asks Pistorius to speak up as Nel asks the athlete about Steenkamp 's neatness .
Nel has begun fourth day of cross - examination . '
Your version is so improbable that it can not be true ..
You have a concocted version "" The court convened at a cliffhanger moment on Friday , when Gerry Nel , the prosecutor summed up in his case by bluntly saying : "" In fact , you knew Reeva was behind the door and you shot at her .
It 's the only thing that makes sense . ""
Under the rules , as Pistorius was under cross - examination when the trial adjourned , he was not allowed to discuss the case with his defence over the weekend .
He has now been been under cross - examination for three days , and it has been brutal .
On Friday , after several mistakes , Judge Thokozile Masipa asked the athlete whether he was making mistakes because he was tired and whether he was able to continue .
Read David Smith 's account of the last session here .
In another article , Smith writes how the trial has turned Nel and his defence counterpart , Barry Roux into reluctant celebrities .
The BBC 's Andrew Harding writes how the last few days have been "" close to a disaster "" for Pistorius .
Pistorius , 27 , says Steenkamp 's death was an accident after he mistook her for an intruder and fired four times with his licensed 9 mm pistol through a toilet door .
Prosecutors say he intended to kill the 29-year - old after a loud argument heard by witnesses and charged him with premeditated murder for which he faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted ."
2014-04-14,"Oscar Pistorius was accused on Monday of deliberately breaking down into tearful histrionics to avoid difficult questions about the night he shot dead his girlfriend .
The Paralympic athlete 's meltdowns have been a daily feature of his evidence from the witness box at the high - profile murder trial in Pretoria , the capital of South Africa , often forcing the judge to halt proceedings .
On Monday alone he sobbed four times and vomited in court . ""
Mr Pistorius , you 're not using your emotional state as an escape , are you ? ""
state prosecutor Gerrie Nel demanded as the 27-year - old 's voice became shrill and he again seemed on the verge of losing on his composure .
"" You 're getting frustrated because your version is improbable and you 're getting emotional . ""
A frustrated Nel repeatedly demanded to know why Pistorius was becoming emotional at tough moments during another day of punishing cross - examination .
The sprinter replied that it is still traumatic for him to relive the night he lost his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , in what he insists was a terrible accident .
Rubbing his eyes and looking exhausted , Pistorius recalled screaming at what he believed to be an intruder in his bathroom in the early hours of 14 February 2013 .
"" Do you remember what you shouted ? ""
Nel asked .
After clenching his jaw for several long seconds and putting his hand to his face , the athlete replied : "" I do .
I said : ' Get the fuck out of my house !
Get the fuck out of my house ! '
"" His voice cracked and he wept .
Asked why he was getting emotional , the athlete replied : "" It was a traumatic evening for me . ""
But Nel claimed Pistorius was crying because he knew he was shouting at Steenkamp and not a supposed intruder , putting the state 's case that she was preparing to leave after an argument when she was shot .
Pistorius denied this , saying : "" I heard the noise and I did not have time to interpret it and fired out of fear . ""
Nel replied : "" You know exactly , you fired at Reeva .
These other versions can not work : you fired at her , you did .
Why are you getting emotional now ? ""
Pistorius wailed through tears in a choking , high - pitched crescendo : "" I did not fire at Reeva ! ""
Judge Thokozile Masipa immediately called another adjournment and Pistorius stood bent over in the witness box , crying and retching .
His psychologist placed her hands on his back to comfort him .
When the trial resumed , Pistorius 's defence counsel Barry Roux asked the judge to intervene because the cross - examination was becoming repetitive . ""
The emotional response is the same .
It 's causing a delay . ""
But Masipa rejected the appeal .
Nel accused Pistorius of crying not out of grief but because he was getting his testimony confused .
"" I 'm going to argue that you got emotional because you got your defences mixed up . ""
Nel probed Pistorius mercilessly on Monday , exploring inconsistencies in his account in an attempt to show that his version of events was improbable and accusing him of tailoring evidence .
Pistorius has repeatedly claimed that he fired the shots accidentally , even though he feared there was an intruder behind the door .
"" I did n't have time to think , "" he said .
"" I heard this noise , and I thought it was somebody coming out to attack me
so I fired my firearm .
""
Nel responded : "" Your defence has now changed , sir , from putative self - defence to involuntary action .
Is that what you 're telling me ? ""
The Olympic runner said : "" I do n't understand the law , ma'am , what I can reply and tell the court is what I 'm asked and I can reply as to what I thought . ""
Nel noted that Pistorius earlier said he warned Steenkamp to call police about an intruder in a whisper , contradicting later testimony that he spoke in a "" low tone "" .
The prosecutor also said blood spatter evidence indicated that the athlete 's statement about the location of a duvet in the bedroom was false .
At the end of another gruelling day , the defence team looked downcast while Pistorius paused to sign a fan 's autograph , writing : "" Thank you for your love and kindness . ""
When Pistorius began his testimony last week he stunned the courtroom with a series of wrenching howls that forced an early adjournment .
At the start of his cross - examination he was confronted with a photo of Steenkamp 's bloodied head that caused another emotional collapse .
Some following the trial on TV and Twitter accused him of play - acting .
At one point Nel put it to the accused : "" Why are you emotional now ?
Now that the questions are difficult ?
Why are you emotional ?
What happened now ? ""
But on that occasion Masipa stepped in , saying : "" Now , hold on , hold on !
It 's fine .
He may be emotional .
He has been emotional throughout . """
2014-04-15,"Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nell ended his five days of brutal cross - examination of Pistorius with the contention that the athlete 's version was not only untruthful but so improbable that it "" can not reasonably , possibly true .
Nel said the court should find that Steenkamp ate within two hours of her death and there was an argument as she was eating .
Nel said : "" You shot four shots through the door while knowing she was standing behind the door , while knowing she was talking to you .
She was locked in the bathroom and you armed yourself with the sole purpose of shooting and killing her , and that 's what you did . ""
Pistorius said Nel 's account was not true .
Barry Roux for the defence spent very little time in re - examination - just nine minutes - but sought to clear up whether the shooting was self - defence or an accident .
Roux asked what Pistorius means when he described the event as an "" accident "" .
Pistorius said : "" The situation - the situation as a whole - it was n't meant to be . ""
He added that he felt "" extremely fearful , overcome with a sense of fear and vulnerability "" when he believed an intruder was in the bathroom .
Asked by Roux whether he consciously pulled the trigger , Pistorius replied : "" Not .
I did n't think about pulling the trigger .
As soon as I heard the noise I pulled the trigger , my lady . ""
Roux also asked Pistorius to read out a Valentine 's card given to him by Steenkamp . ""
The front of the card reads , ' Roses are red , violets are blue ' and inside Reeva wrote : "" I think today is a good day to tell you that I love you "" .
The card had a smiley face and some kisses .

A footnote to the trial .
The South African Human Rights Commission ( SAHRC ) has rejected a complaint filed against Gerrie Nel , when he called Pistorius a liar while the athlete was on the stand last week .
The commission said in a statement : The complainant believed the statement might have infringed Pistoriusâ€ ™ rights to be presumed innocent until proven guilty ; freedom of expression ; and human dignity , generally impacting on his right to a fair trial as contained in the bill of rights ...
The SAHRC considered the complaint within the context of basic fair trial rights protected in the constitution .
However on a close assessment of the facts of the matter , international jurisprudence , the bar council rules , its own jurisdiction , and authority of the court , the complaint was rejected .
â€¢ ' As soon as I heard the noise I pulled the trigger ' â€¢ Prosecutor says Pistorius shot Steenkamp as they were talking â€¢ Pistorius finishes gruelling cross - examination Dixon tells the court that the blows against the toilet door from the bat came after the bullets hitting the door .
Close up of bullet holes in the door appears on court monitors .
Here 's part of an Associated Press story on Nel 's final moments of cross - examination .
Nel closed his cross - examination Tuesday by inviting Pistorius to take the blame for shooting Steenkamp , but the runner steered away from a direct response , saying only that he opened fire because he believed his life was under threat .
That remark drew barbed follow - up questions from the prosecutor .
"" We should blame somebody ...
Should we blame Reeva ?
"" asked Nel , who has harshly criticised Pistorius as someone who is unwilling to take responsibility . ""
No , my lady , "" Pistorius replied , addressing the judge in line with court custom . ""
She never told you she was going to the toilet , "" Nel said .
Then he asked : "" Should we blame the government ? ""
When Pistorius responded with another reference to a perceived attacker in his toilet , Nel asked : Who should we blame for the Black Talon rounds that ripped through her body ? ""
He abandoned his line of questioning soon after the judge questioned whether he was asking the same thing in a different way .
Nel summed up by saying Pistorius intentionally killed Steenkamp .
Roux turns to the cricket bat marks on the toilet door . ""
Most probably only three blows , "" says Dixon .
Dixon also tested for the sound of the bat on the door .
Pistorius has his head in his hands , looking down .
Dixon is on the for the defence to back Pistorius 's account that it was pitch dark in the bedroom and that the lights were out .
His neighbours , the Stipps , said lights were on .
Dixon also tested night view of Pistorius 's house from neighbours .
There is some visibility .
Dixon is talking about how dark it was in the bedroom and the passageway .
Pistorius had told the court how dark it was in the main bedroom on the night of the shooting .
Court has resumed .
Roux will question a Roger Dixon - a forensic expert .
Dixon is going through his qualifications .
He has worked with the FBI as well as the South African police .
Pistorius has finished giving evidence in his murder trial after seven gruelling days in the witness box .
The court is adjourned until later today , when the first defence witnesses will be called .
Roux , the athlete 's defence barrister , takes Pistorius back to when he was asked by the prosecution about his relationship with Reeva .
Pistorius is holding in his hand a Valentine 's letter and card from Reeva , which was meant for the day when the shooting happened .
The front of the card reads , ' Roses are red , violets are blue ' and inside Reeva wrote : "" I think today is a good day to tell you that I love you "" .
She signed the card with her name and a smiley face and some kisses .
Pistorius is asked about the sound he heard about the bathroom door slamming .
He says he thought it was someone either slamming or kicking the door .
Roux then asks what Pistorius means when he describes the event as an "" accident "" .
The athlete answers : The situation - the situation as a whole - it was n't meant to be .
Pistorius says he felt "" extremely fearful , overcome with a sense of fear and vulnerability "" when he believed an intruder was in the bathroom .
Roux :
Did you pull the trigger consciously or not ?
Pistorius :
Not .
I did n't think about pulling the trigger .
As soon as I heard the noise I pulled the trigger , my lady .
The court has resumed after a short break and Pistorius is being re - examined by his defence barrister , Barry Roux .
We 'll be back in the Pretoria court in half an hour .
Nel goes for Pistorius , who has his head bowed , saying : "" Your version is not only untruthful but it 's so improbable that it can not be reasonably , possibly true . ""
Pistorius : "" I do n't agree , my lady . ""
Nel says the court should find that Reeva ate within two hours of her death and there was an argument as she was eating .
He adds that three witnesses heard Reeva 's "" bloodcurdling screams , not yours , when she escaped from you . ""
Nel says : You shot four shots through the door while knowing she was standing behind the door , while knowing she was talking to you .
She was locked in the bathroom and you armed yourself with the sole purpose of shooting and killing her , and that 's what you did .
"" That 's not true , my lady , "" replies Pistorius .
Nel concludes his cross - examination , saying he has nothing further for the athlete .
Nel changes tack and asks Pistorius who should be blamed for Reeva 's death .
Pistorius answers : I do n't know , my lady .
I was scared .
My lady , I believed there was a threat that was on my life .
The athlete is asked who should be blamed for the black talon bullets which ripped into her body .
"" I do n't understand the question , "" he says .
Asked why he had black talon ammunition , Pistorius adds that that was the type of bullet he used for his firearm .
Nel takes that line of enquiry no further .
We 're back from the short adjournment and Nel is pressing Pistorius on the magazine rack in the bathroom .
There was blood on the magazine rack , according to a photo shown to court : Nel says the blood smear on the magazine rack indicates that Reeva 's head must have touched it .
Pistorius says the blood may have smeared on the magazine rack when he lifted Reeva on to him . ""
When I found Reeva it was definitely not there , my lady . ""
Nel says the magazine rack never moved .
Pistorius insists that it did .
We are now on to why Pistorius called his friend Justin Divaris at 4 am and why his phone was plugged into a charger in his kitchen .
Pistorius says he is not sure who put the phone on charge .
Nel , the prosecutor , asks for a 10 minute adjournment as he deals with a note from his legal team .
Pistorius says he was told by the emergency services to take Reeva to hospital instead of waiting for an ambulance .
The athlete , now sobbing , says he pleaded "" Baby , please hold on "" and "" Jesus , please help me "" as he prayed for Reeva .
Pistorius says he does n't remember speaking to security but the phone records show he rang him first .
He does n't know why he apparently told security "" everything is fine "" .
Pistorius says there was a lot of blood on the toilet seat , where she was slumped with her right arm on the bowl and her head resting on her right shoulder .
The magazine rack was in a different position to where it is shown in the crime scene photograph shown to court , he adds .
Asked what happened next , Pistorius says : I saw over her , I crouched over her
and I put my left arm underneath her right arm
and I checked to see if she was breathing
or she had a pulse .
And then I â€ “ I did n't feel that she did
so I just sat , pulled her on to me
and then I heard her breathing
so I immediately tried to pick her up and get her out of the toilet .
I was n't able to pick her up
so I scuffled around with my legs , which is probably how I kicked the magazine rack .
Pistorius says he tried to pick Reeva up but could n't .
He saw her mobile phone on the bathroom floor so picked it up , rushed to the bedroom and left it there .
He then picked up his own mobile phone and ran back to Reeva 's body .
Pistorius says a small piece of wood panel on the door broke off and he peered into the toilet and saw Reeva .
I ripped the panel out into the bathroom and tried to climb into the bathroom ...
When I saw her I tried to unlock the door
but there was no key ...
then I saw the key on the floor and I unlocked the door and flung it open , my lady .
Pistorius 's voice breaks with emotion , occasionally pausing , as he is asked to explain what he saw in the bathroom :
She was , erm â€ “
she was , erm
â€ “ sitting on the floor to the right of the toilet .
She was seated on her right buttock with her right arm on top of the toilet bowl and her head was on her shoulder .
Nel , the prosecutor , asks Pistorius to perform another demonstration in court of how he shoulder charged the bathroom door .
Pistorius is swinging the bat at the door , once accidentally touching the door .
Pistorius went to get the cricket bat and rushed back to the bathroom .
He describes the moment he was "" overcome with terror and despair "" : I was screaming , ' Reeva !
Reeva ! ' and crying the more desperate I got that I could n't get into the toilet
, I was crying out .
I ran to get the cricket bat ... crying and screaming .
I was overcome with terror and despair .
At times I was screaming loud , at times I was crying out .
Pistorius is describing again how he broke into the bathroom , screaming the entire time while he struck repeatedly at the door with a cricket bat .
I was crying out for the Lord to help me
and I was screaming for Reeva .
The athlete adds that the pistol was in his right hand as he charged the door with his left shoulder , with the door handle in his left hand .
He says he does n't know why he still had the gun in his hand , when asked by Nel .
Pistorius tells the court he 's "" getting confused "" as Nel accuses him of "" constantly thinking of a version "" of events . ""
That 's not true , my lady , "" the athlete says .
"" It 's getting more and more improbable and you 're tailoring more and more of your evidence as we go on , "" Nel says .
Nel takes Pistorius back to the athlete 's bail application .
In the application , he says he heard movement in the bathroom â€ “ and yesterday Pistorius said it sounded like someone was moving wood near the toilet .
The prosecutor points out that there is no mention of wood in the bail application , leaving the inference that he was referring to intruders .
"" If I said I heard a noise it would be open to interpretation â€ “
I said I heard a noise , "" he says .
"" What I think may have been the magazine rack moving .
"" Why would you fire shots because you heard the magazine rack moving , asks Nel .
Pistorius : "" Because I thought it was the door opening , my lady .
In retrospect it could have only been the magazine rack because the door did n't open , my lady . ""
Nel puts it to Pistorius that , on his version of events , Steenkamp must have opened the bathroom window before she went to the toilet .
The prosecutor says that if this version was true , she would have had to had time to void her bladder and get dressed before shutting the door .
"" On my understanding there would not have been enough time for her to do that , "" Nel says .
"" I disagree , my lady , "" replies the athlete .
Oscar Pistorius has entered the witness box in Pretoria for a seventh day â€ “ his fifth under cross - examination by Gerrie Nel , the chief prosecutor .
Nel says he will "" finalise "" cross - examination of Pistorius today as he asks for a postponement later in the week .
We will have a live video stream from the court shortly .
Good morning .
There is a sense that Gerrie Nel , the chief prosecutor , is on the point of wrapping up his cross examination after putting Oscar Pistorius through the wringer after four days of testimony .
Yesterday Nel told the court that the Paralympian 's girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , packed her clothes and was preparing to leave his house before the athlete shot and killed her .
In the course of yesterday 's testimony , which was stopped twice when the athlete became too emotional to continue , Pistorius seemed to shift his ground , moving away from self - defence , to claiming that the shooting was involuntary , saying at one point : "" Before I could make sense of the situation , I fired four shots .
"" You can read an account of yesterday 's events in this article by the Guardian 's David Smith .
Pistorius , 27 , says Steenkamp 's death was an accident after he mistook her for an intruder and fired four times with his licensed 9 mm pistol through a toilet door .
Prosecutors say he intended to kill the 29-year - old after a loud argument heard by witnesses and charged him with premeditated murder for which he faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted ."
2014-04-15,""" Roses are red , violets are blue .
Today is a good day to tell you that
…
I love you .
"" That was the text in a Valentine 's Day card that Reeva Steenkamp wrote to her boyfriend , Oscar Pistorius , hours before he shot and killed her .
It was the last piece of evidence heard as the Paralympic athlete completed a harrowing week of testimony on Tuesday , wrapping up the central chapter of a sensational murder trial .
As a shellshocked Pistorius stepped down from the witness box , the court exhaled its collective breath and relief was written on the faces of his watching family .
A man once lauded for his sporting achievements – the first amputee to run in the Olympics – had discovered how harsh the flipside of celebrity can be .
Many following the trial on television and Twitter have now turned against him .
Goaded , taunted and tormented by the prosecution , Pistorius was perhaps his own worst enemy during cross - examination , suffering surprising memory lapses and appearing evasive , agitated , petulant and self - contradictory .
In particular , his explanation of why he pulled the trigger by "" accident "" mutated often and never solidified .
But some believe that prosecutor Gerrie Nel , while remorselessly attacking Pistorius 's claim that he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder , never quite established a motive or landed a knockout punch .
As the trial enters its final phase , the athlete 's legal team will go all out in an attempt to sow reasonable doubt over his guilt .
The fightback began immediately after the cross - examination .
Defence counsel Barry Roux asked Pistorius about a Valentine 's card that Steenkamp had intended to give him on 14 February 2013 , the day she died .
The 27-year - old accused said : "" The envelope says ' Ozzie ' , with some hearts and a squiggle , and then it says on the front of the card : ' Roses are red , violets are blue ' .
Then on the inside she wrote the date on the left , then on the right she said : ' I think today is a good day to tell you that
…
I love you . '
"" It was signed "" Reeves "" , with a smiley face and three kisses .
The timing of Steenkamp 's death has always been seen as a poignant element in a case already replete with noirish twists .
On 13 February the blonde model had tweeted : "" What do you have up your sleeve for your love tomorrow ? ? ?
# getexcited # ValentinesDay "" .
The Valentine 's card was an ace kept up the sleeve of the defence in riposte to Nel 's assertion that Pistorius was bullying and narcissistic and argued with Steenkamp shortly before murdering her .
Last week the prosecution highlighted WhatsApp messages between the couple that showed they never used the words "" I love you "" to one another .
But the defence has many more hills to climb .
Winding up his cross - examination , Nel put the state 's case in a nutshell for the first time .
He said Steenkamp ate around two hours before her death , when the couple had an argument that was heard by a neighbour .
She locked herself in the toilet and screamed .
Pistorius then took his pistol and fired through the door as the two talked , even changing his aim when she fell backwards inside the cubicle .
Earlier Nel had forced Pistorius to relive the shooting one last time in an attempt to make him accept responsibility .
"" We said we should blame you for taking her life , "" Nel said .
"" Who should we blame for you having shot her ?
We should blame somebody
…
Should we blame Reeva for not telling you she was going to the toilet ? ""
"" No , my lady , "" Pistorius told judge Thokozile Masipa .
Nel asked : "" Should we blame the government ? ""
– an unusually explicit political reference to Pistorius 's fears of crime in South Africa and claim that the police never helped his family .
Pistorius replied : "" I believed there was a threat . ""
Nel pressed : "" But we can not blame you for having shot and killed Reeva ? ""
Again Pistorius insisted : "" I believed there was someone coming out to attack me . ""
Nel then made reference to the lethally expanding bullets that he fired four times : "" Who should we blame for the Black Talon rounds that ripped through her body ? ""
Pistorius explained it was the type of ammunition used in his firearm .
Asked about the moments when he broke down the toilet door and found Steenkamp , a tearful Pistorius recalled : "" I was broken , I was overcome , filled with sadness . ""
He said he told his girlfriend : "" ' Baby , please hold on .
Jesus , please help me . '
I was praying for her . ""
Pistorius remained in the witness box while Roux asked him to describe his thoughts and emotions in the seconds before he shot at the door .
"" I was terrified , "" Pistorius said .
"" I feared for my life .
I was just scared .
I was thinking about what could happen to me , to Reeva .
I was just extremely fearful . ""
Pistorius has remained vague on whether he consciously pulled the trigger in self - defence or if it went off involuntarily .
"" I did n't think about pulling the trigger , "" he said .
"" As soon as I heard the noise , I pulled the trigger . ""
Roux said : "" But you pulled the trigger ? ""
Pistorius replied : "" That 's correct . ""
Pistorius also stood in the middle of the court re - enacting the moment he struck the toilet door with a cricket bat to reach Steenkamp .
He said he was "" heartbroken "" when he first saw Steenkamp 's body .
"" I crouched down over her …
and I checked to see if she was breathing
or if she had a pulse , "" he said .
Surprisingly , after six days of gruelling testimony , Pistorius 's re - examination by Roux lasted only eight minutes .
Some may feel this was to prevent him doing himself yet more damage in a trial that has walked a perilous line between legal education and voyeuristic entertainment .
William Booth , a lawyer and analyst , said : "" I do n't think Oscar did particularly well .
He 's a poor witness .
He did n't answer questions and he gave long , rambling answers .
He contradicted himself . ""
But he added : "" Even if he 's a poor witness , is he a lying witness ?
For a conviction , the judge has to reject his version as false and find the state 's case proven beyond a reasonable doubt . """

2014-04-17,Live tweets from the court from Africa correpsondent David Smith .
2014-04-17,"An expert witness for Oscar Pistorius 's defence was accused of "" irresponsibility "" on Wednesday after admitting that he is not trained in ballistics , light , sound or blood spatter evidence and was not present at Reeva Steenkamp 's postmortem .
Roger Dixon , a geologist and university lecturer who worked at a police forensic laboratory in Pretoria for 18 years , came under sustained attack from prosecutor Gerrie Nel over his credentials and the manner of his investigation .
Pistorius watched from the dock , burying his head in his hands and retching at one stage , as Dixon described the impact of the bullets he fired on Valentine 's Day last year , including one that struck Steenkamp 's arm "" like an instant amputation "" .
The Paralympic sprinter denies murder , claiming that he fired by accident because he feared an intruder .
Earlier in the trial Pistorius 's defence counsel had raised allegations of police bungling and botched evidence , but now it was the turn of the prosecution to tear into the 27-year - old 's team of experts .
Dixon was subjected to the same withering cross - examination from Nel , known as "" the pitbull "" , that Pistorius himself endured for five torrid days in the witness box .
He presented a different order of the shots that killed 29-year - old Steenkamp and said she was probably hit in the hip and the arm in quick succession by the first two shots while standing close to the door , and may have had her right arm extended to the door handle , as if she were about to open it .
Dixon also claimed that a bruise on Steenkamp 's right buttock was caused by her falling back on a magazine rack , contradicting the finding of state pathologist Gert Saayman .
Confronted with a section of the post - mortem report , Dixon exclaimed : "" What ! ""
When he went on to begin a sentence with the words , "" In my layman 's understanding ... "" Nel pounced and said : "" You see ,
Mr Dixon , now you call yourself a layman .
"" The witness admitted that he had not attended the postmortem , a fact of which Nel frequently reminded him .
Dixon said he had only been present at three postmortems during his career .
Saayman has performed between 10,000 and 15,000 .
Nel pressed : "" You are not a wound ballistics expert ? ""
Dixon said : "" No . ""
Later Nel asked : "" Are you a blood spatter expert ? ""
Dixon replied : "" I have received no training in blood spatter analysis . ""
The geologist testified that Pistorius 's bedroom would have been almost completely dark on the evening of the shooting , supporting the accused 's claim that he did not see whether Steenkamp was still in bed when he got up .
But asked what expert skills he had used to establish this , Dixon said : "" The instruments I used there were my eyes . ""
The court also heard about sound tests that the defence conducted to show that a cricket bat smashing against the toilet door could be mistaken for gunshots â€ “ crucial to challenging neighbours ' claims of what they heard on the night of the killing .
Dixon said he had hit an identical door with a bat to recreate the noises .
Nel , his voice rising impatiently , challenged him : "" Are you a sound expert , sir ?
Have you received training in decibels and sound ? ""
Dixon replied : "" I would hope I 'm a sound expert â€ ¦
The expertise used was attempting to reconstruct the situation â€
¦ I was not listening to myself making that sound . ""
He conceded that the test had to be done a second time because of problems with the first test when the pistol jammed , and they were recorded by a music producer with no known experience in recording gunshots .
Dixon said fibres he had seen on the door probably came from the sock Pistorius wore over his prosthetic leg when he tried to kick down the door after shooting through it .
But again he was forced to admit : "" There is no course I 've ever been on that has trained me to do a physical match . ""
He also said he had not taken close - up photos of the door until he saw it in the courtroom last month with a "" nice light "" and "" decent camera "" .
Losing patience , Nel described Dixon as evasive and put it to him : "" It is the height of irresponsibility to make inferences in areas where you 're not expert .
Am I right ? ""
The trial will continue on Thursday and will then be adjourned until 5 May."
2014-04-17,"A defence witness for Oscar Pistorius has claimed that a Facebook post in which he complained about his reputation being destroyed in court was a "" joke "" .
Roger Dixon 's credibility and competence were repeatedly questioned by prosecutor Gerrie Nel during the trial of the Paralympic sprinter , accused of murdering his girlfriend on Valentine 's day last year .
In a Facebook message on Thursday morning that he did not intend to be publicly accessible , the geologist wrote : "" Third day in court today .
Let 's see how much of my credibility , integrity and professional reputation is destroyed .
It is difficult to get belief in those who will not listen because it is not what they want to hear .
After that , beer ! ""
Following the end of his testimony on Thursday , the trial was adjourned until 5 May and Dixon stayed true to his word , relaxing with a beer at the International Police Association in Pretoria .
He said of the Facebook post : "" That was actually a joke .
I said it lightheartedly .
I do n't let things like that upset me .
You can not let emotions influence you at all . ""
The 54-year - old endured a barbed cross - examination from Nel and widespread ridicule on Twitter but insisted : "" I was police forensics for 18 years .
If you 're an expert witness and you go to court , and our court system is adversarial , that 's one of the things you must expect .
I 've had a lot of support from friends .
I said , ' Once more unto the breach , dear friends ' . ""
Asked if he had any regrets about his testimony , Dixon replied : "" It 's over .
I 'm not going to dissect it .
If you have regrets , it means you did something wrong .
If you 're pleased , it means you beat somebody and that 's not what it 's about . ""
Nel ripped into Dixon over his admission that he is not a qualified expert in ballistics , blood spatter and other areas .
Dixon said : "" I am aware there has been quite a lot of commentary .
These were all highly influenced by other factors .
I 'm not worried about it .
I 'm being honest .
I 'm working accurately to the facts .
The world could see this : I was n't against being televised .
"" I was accused of not having integrity .
That 's Mr Nel 's opinion .
He was trying to get to me .
You know what they say : all 's fair in love and war . ""
Dixon , who says he does not have a TV or radio at home and does not buy newspapers , declined to comment on whether his evidence had increased or decreased the likelihood of Pistorius being convicted .
"" That 's for the judge to decide , "" he said .
"" As a forensic expert , I 'm not there to judge . ""
In court Nel assailed him again over a test he conducted to see if Pistorius 's head and body could have seen by neighbours through a bathroom window on the night of the killing .
Dixon admitted using a man on his knees who was 20 cm shorter than the double amputee athlete on his stumps .
"" It is something I omitted , "" Dixon conceded .
"" I overlooked it at the time . ""
Dixon , who in the witness box wielded one of the prosthetic limbs that Pistorius wore and peeled off a sock , said the balcony light was off when he tried to recreate what the sportsman could see , even though Pistorius has acknowledged it was on .
He also contradicted the accused 's evidence regarding the position of a magazine rack in the toilet cubicle where Reeva Steenkamp died .
Pistorius denies murder , claiming that he fired four shots at what he believed to be an intruder ."
2014-04-26,"The track hero , the blonde model , blood , death , tears .
It 's a compelling TV super - soap .
But the trial of Oscar Pistorius , viewed from South Africa at least , is much more than that –
and so is its real star , Thokozile Masipa ( also known , in that irritatingly quavery voice , as "" My Lady "" ) .
The presiding judge is important , if you listen to ordinary people , because she 's a woman , a former crime reporter on the Sowetan turned brilliant lawyer and , now , the unchallenged master of legal ceremonies .
The point is that , day by day , you can see her – and all the trial , bar Oscar 's long face – in action .
An education , not a soap .
Viewers can come to grips with the rituals of the law , tune in for expert commentary or read a review of the day in the papers .
For them , understanding equals enhanced respect , just as watching Masipa adds admiration .
The cameras , in short , bring a bonus beyond mere human interest .
They make the courts live .
And that , perhaps , is something for Britain 's far more cautious judiciary to ponder .
Of course our shrinking jury system makes a difference .
But surely we can go further and wider than supreme court decisions read on air ?
British law is bleeding from a thousand cuts – to solicitors , barristers , court support services .
Judges , right up the tree , are alarmed and despondent .
But because we do n't see what they all do , because we ca n't relate to their world , they seem to suffer in a vacuum .
Law UK has always hugged its privileges close , seeing the press – let alone TV – as enemy , not friend .
But the Pistorius trial , and its effect on South African society , shows that there can be another way .
Call it the Masipa way to an open road ."
2014-05-05,"â€¢ After a two - week break , the defence picked up its case with two witnesses who were first on the scene after Pistorius shot Steenkamp :
Johan Stander and his daughter Carice Viljoen .
â€¢ Stander revealed details of the call Pistorius made to him immediately after the shooting .
ï»¿Johan , please , please , come to my house , please .
I shot Reeva .
I thought she was an intruder .
Please , please come quick .
â€¢
But state prosecutor Gerrie Nel queried Stander 's inference that the shooting was a mistake , saying that Pistorius ' claim that he had thought her to be an intruder did not mean that the athlete had mistakenly fired his gun .
â€¢ Viljoen said she was woken by a man 's voice shouting and described her fear and initial reluctance to act : I could n't pinpoint where it [ the shouting ] was coming from .
It was clear somebody needed help .
I closed my door , I closed my blind , I got back into my bed â€
¦
I was thinking , I do n't know how to help the person who 's in trouble .
â€¢
Both testified that they had arrived at Pistorius ' house to find him carrying a bleeding Steenkamp down the stairs and that the athlete was crying , screaming and begging for help .
Viljoen told the court : "" There was blood everywhere . ""
â€¢ Stander said a neighbour , Dr Johan Stipp , had told him he had heard four shots , screaming , then another four shots .
Dr Stipp has previously told the court he heard three loud bangs .
I was very concerned .
You can not shoot eight shots at someone , even an intruder.ï » ¿ â€¢ Pistorius went back upstairs to fetch Steenkamp 's ID .
Viljoen went after him , she said , fearing he would kill or harm himself .
He had told paramedics the gun was still in the bathroom .
â€¢
Both Stander and Viljoen gave evidence of several people â€ “ neighbours , friends , police in uniform and civilian clothes
â€ “ entering and leaving the house .
Viljoen said nobody was controlling who came and went .
The defence alleges that crucial evidence in Pistorius ' bedroom was tampered with by police officers .
â€¢ Stander , who had been on the management committee for the estate , recounted several instances of breaking - and - entering crimes there , including via a ladder , which were disputed by the state .
Nel insisted the estate was a safe place to live .
â€¢
The defence queried why â€ “ despite being interviewed as witnesses for the state , and having considered themselves as such â€ “ neither Stander nor Viljoen were called by the prosecution .
Stander said he was told he would not be needed as his daughter would be called and the state would need only one person from the family .
But she was not called .
â€¢
The defence had expected the evidence of Stander and Viljoen to last all day and had no more witnesses to offer .
The court is adjourned until Tuesday morning .
Roux is telling the judge the defence has been unable to get more than two witnesses for today ; he had hoped their evidence would take up the whole day , and has struggled to get a third or fourth witness to appear .
He asks for an adjournment till Tuesday morning .
Nel and the judge agree .
Roux and the judge have both apparently only just discovered that Wednesday is a public holiday for the South African general elections .
So it looks as if the court will not sit on that day .
Nel is asking about how "" frantic "" Pistorius was after the shooting â€ “ both Viljoen and her father have testified that he was .
Nel says the athlete was able to tell her where the towels were , to discuss putting fingers into Steenkamp 's mouth so she could breathe .
Viljoen agrees : "" He was following what was going on . ""
Nel is done ; there will be no re - examination , so that 's it for Carice Viljoen 's evidence .
Carice Viljoen is still being cross - examined by Gerrie Nel .
He is still interested in the calls made after the shooting and the phones from which they were made .
Viljoen confirms she made three calls : one to his friend Justin Divaris ; Peet , his manager ; and his brother , Carl .
You can read a report of this morning 's proceedings so far here .
And here is an excerpt : Oscar Pistorius 's murder trial has resumed , with a neighbour and friend giving a heart - wrenching account of finding the "" broken "" athlete coming down the stairs , holding his dead girlfriend in his arms .
After a two - week break in proceedings , Pistorius 's defence called Johan Stander , the first person to arrive at the crime scene after the Paralympic gold medallist shot his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , on Valentine 's Day last year . ""
Oom [ Afrikaans for uncle ]
Johan , please , please , please come to my house , I shot Reeva , "" Stander said Pistorius told him over the phone .
When he arrived at Pistorius 's Pretoria home , Stander described seeing the athlete carrying Steenkamp , a 29-year - old model and law graduate , down the stairs . ""
He was screaming , he was crying , he was praying , "" said Stander .
"" The expression on his face , an expression of sorrow , an expression of pain , he 's crying , he 's praying â€
¦
It was as if he was torn apart.""ï
»
¿ Nel asks for a five - minute adjournment .
"" This witness gave her evidence at the speed of light , "" he says .
"" Yes , I also want to see you , "" the judge tells Nel and Roux .
Pistorius told paramedics that the gun was in the bathroom , Viljoen says .
She adds that she ca n't remember whether the upstairs lights were on when she followed the athlete there .
Nel 's reputation has the witness on edge .
He asks her to look at a photograph .
Viljoen : Is this going to be a photo which will make me cry ?
It is a picture of the first floor landing and the linen cupboard from where Viljoen fetched towels to stem Steenkamp 's bleeding .
Carice Viljoen , like her father Johan Stander , was originally expected to be a witness for the state , but she was not called .
She confirms to Nel that Aimee Pistorius packed a watch for her brother .
( Two of his expensive watches also went missing from the crime scene , presumed stolen . )
The police took Pistorius into the garage to take photos .
Viljoen says they "" struggled "" to get him to go past Steenkamp 's body .
She and Pistorius ' sister , Aimee , then went upstairs to pack some clothes for him , before he was taken away by the police .
Gerrie Nel has now started his cross - examination .
There seem to have been a lot of people â€ “ neighbours , friends , police in uniform and civilian clothes â€ “ coming in and out of the house after the shooting .
Viljoen says there was no control over who entered and left the house .
I remember seeing people going up and down the stairs , but canâ€ ™ t say who they are .
Viljoen says Pistorius phoned someone ( later known to be Justin Divaris ) "" but he was n't making any sense "" .
Viljoen took the phone from him and talked to Divaris .
I must have said something like , Oscar shot Reeva .
She passed away , please come
quickly.ï
» ¿
Pistorius went upstairs to fetch Steenkamp 's ID .
Viljoen knew the gun was upstairs and she was scared he was going to kill himself , so she ran up after him .
He came back with Steenkamp 's bag "" immediately â€
¦ it was n't very long , my lady "" .
June Steenkamp , Reeva 's mother , is in court listening to this evidence of her daughter 's final moments and the efforts made to save her .
Pistorius had his head in his hands , according to reporters in court .
Viljoen says Dr Stipp did not stay inside the house very long .
He said it was "" very bad "" .
She confirms Pistorius said he had thought Steenkamp was an intruder , but they did not discuss it further â€ “ "" we were trying to save a life "" .
Viljoen continues : I said we need to stop the bleeding .
I proceeded up the stairs to his linen cupboard and I grabbed a few towels .
He was praying to god the whole time ; he was begging Reeva to stay with him .
He was begging and pleading with Reeva : stay with me , my love , stay with me .
Viljoen says she tried to make a tourniquet around Steenkamp 's injured arm , but it would not work .
Viljoen sounds distressed as she continues .
This is probably the most detailed account the court has heard .
The whole time he kept on saying where 's the ambulance , where are they ? '
I just kept telling him , they 're coming .
We tried our best .
Viljoen is talking about what she saw when she arrived at Pistorius ' house .
The first thing I saw was Oscar carrying Reeva down the stairs .
We were facing each other .
He was walking rather fast .
He was frantic . '
Carice , please , Carice , please , can we get her in the car and take her to the hospital . '
He was begging me to put her in the car .
I told him to put her down .
I told him we just need to see what 's going on .
I just saw blood everywhere .
Viljoen is in tears .
Viljoen says she heard a "" commotion "" in her parents ' room .
She told her mother she had heard shouting .
Her mother told her Pistorius had rung Johan Stander ( the witness ' father ) saying he had shot Steenkamp , thinking she was an intruder .
She then jumped in the car with her father and drove to Pistorius ' home .
Carine Viljoen is back on the stand , answering questions from lead defence counsel , Barry Roux .
She says the shouting she heard was a man 's voice .
Roux says the questioning of Viljoen is going into "" a new phase "" and asks for a tea break .
It 'll probably be 15 minutes or so before the court is back .
As with her father , Viljoen has asked not to be televised giving her evidence .
She says she was woken in the early hours of 14 February 2013 by her dogs barking .
Her balcony doors were open because of the heat .
I heard a person shouting ' help , help , help ' .
I thought oh my gosh , something is wrong .
I first of all froze in my bed .
I closed my sliding door because â€ ¦
I was scared
maybe somebody was going to come into my bedroom .
I could n't pinpoint where it [ the shouting ] was coming from .
It was clear somebody needed help .
I closed my door , I closed my blind , I got back into my bed .
I remember my heart was pounding so fast , I was very afraid and my dogs were still very restless .
I pulled the covers over myself , how am I going to fall asleep now after I heard that ?
I was thinking , I do n't know how to help the person who 's in trouble .
Carice Stander is the daughter of Johan Stander .
She has been called today under her married name , Carice Viljoen .
She is a legal adviser , and says she is a friend of Pistorius : "" we had coffee every now and again "" .
She no longer lives on the Silverwoods estate , but was living in her parents ' house on the night of Steenkamp 's death .
Barry Roux takes over questioning for the defence now .
The assessor â€ “ one of the judge 's assistants
â€ “ made a rare intervention to ask if Steenkamp knew how to deactivate the alarm in Pistorius ' house .
She did , says Stander .
( This is the assessor whose illness earlier in the trial forced the court to take a break . )
And that 's all the questions for this witness .
Oldwage is back on the mobile phone used by Stander 's daughter to call Divaris after the shooting .
Stander confirms it was charging in the kitchen ; he does n't know who it belonged to .
The court has previously heard detailed evidence of the various phones belonging to Pistorius and Steenkamp , and their usage on the night in question .
Gerrie Nel resumes his cross examination of Johan Stander , asking him whether Pistorius ' house was fitted with an alarm .
Stander confirms it was ; he used it when feeding Pistorius ' dogs when he was away .
And that 's all from Nel .
Kenny Oldwage will re - examine the witness now .
Nel is pushing Stander hard on events since the shooting .
Has he been back to Pistorius ' house ?
No .
Did he discuss the screams that Stipp said he heard ?
No .
Did he quiz Stipp on whether the eight shots he heard were gunshots ?
No , he assumed they were .
Stander says he did let Stipp know he had given his phone number to the defence .
"" I thought it was right thing to do . ""
The court now takes a brief adjournment for Nel to gather some advice .
Has Stander followed reports of the trial , Nel wonders ?
Yes , I read the newspapers , says Stander ; "" I could n't call it everything
, I could n't follow everything that 's been said .
"" Nel continues his grilling of the witness , turning now to phone calls made .
Stander says his daughter made a call to Justin Divaris , a friend of Pistorius .
Nel now turns to the "" eight shots "" evidence â€ “ Stander says another neighbour , Dr Stipp , told him he 'd heard eight in total .
Stander is stumbling over the details of the call Pistorius made to him on the night .
He tells Nel the athlete said "" it was a mistake "" ; Nel points out this is a new piece of evidence .
Stander takes it back â€
“
it was his own inference , Pistorius did not say it .
Stander
: It was a mistake that I made now , in what I 'm saying .
Nel :
Why would you make such a mistake ?
Are you here to help Mr Pistorius ?
Stander : I am here to tell the truth â€ ¦ ï»¿He never said he made a mistake ,
that was my understanding .
I interpreted from that phone call â€ ¦ as far as I 'm concerned it was a mistake .
Nel :
What was a mistake ?
How can you , out of that call , say the fact that he shot her was a mistake ?
Stander : He thought she was an intruder .
Nel :
Why do you want to tell the court that he made a mistake by shooting ?
Nel has argued before that , regardless of who was in the locked toilet , Pistorius acted illegally by intending to kill the person behind the door .
Stander tells Nel he has not discussed Steenkamp 's death with Pistorius since the night it happened .
He and his daughter did attend a memorial for Steenkamp at Pistorius ' uncle 's house but did not talk about it , he says .
He says he has never seen Pistorius with a gun .
Reporters in court say it is the first time that Pistorius ' sister , Aimee , has not been there to support him .
Nel is very interested in the fact Stander did not have burglar - proofing on his own house ( the witness says that rules of the estate prohibited it ) and that his daughter â€ “ who heard screams on the night in question â€ “ went to bed with her balcony door open .
Nel leaps straight in on the security measures on the estate .
Did the management committee increase the height of the walls because of these crime fears ?
They did not , but beams were added to the tops of the walls .
When did the incident where a woman was tied up happen , asks Nel .
Stander ca n't remember exactly .
The incident with the ladder , who was involved ?
The man involved was a good friend of Pistorius , Nel says .
Stander can not recall if it was reported to the police .
Nel asks Stander if the estate was a safe place to live in February 2013 .
Nowhere is 100 % safe , Stander says .
The court is being shown an aerial photo of the estate , showing Stander 's and Pistorius ' homes .
The distance between the two is 212 m .
Oldwage asks the witness to confirm the route he and his daughter drove .
There is a lot of discussion about different markings on the photo about the distance and routes between the two properties .
It 's unclear what the precise purpose of this line of questioning is , but it does confirm the two properties are close .
The defence has now finished its questions for Stander .
Stander says he told Pistorius about these incidents and his concerns about the safety of the estate .
Nel , in his cross - examination of the athlete , argued that he had exaggerated his professed fear of crime .
Stander insists they had discussed it .
We are now hearing about crime on the Silverwoods estate , where Pistorius lived .
Stander was a manager of the management committee at Silverwoods until January 2013 ( Steenkamp was killed in February ) .
Gerrie Nel , the state prosecutor , places on record that while he is not objecting to the witness ' evidence of alleged crimes on the estate , he is not accepting it .
He says it is hearsay .
Stipp testified for the state earlier on in the trial .
You can read his evidence here .
He said then that he remembered he was awakened by three loud bangs on the night of the murder .
He walked out onto the balcony and heard screaming , he says : â€œIt sounded to me like the voice of a female.â€ � The number of shots is different to the evidence given by Stander today , relaying what he said he was told by Stipp on the night of Steenkamp 's death .
We 've now returned to the evidence of what the neighbour Dr Stipp allegedly told Stander on the scene .
Stander reiterates : four shots , screams , silence , four shots again .
I was very concerned .
You can not shoot eight shots at someone , even an intruder.ï » ¿
The questioning turns to how long Pistorius spent upstairs when he went to fetch Steenkamp 's ID .
It was not minutes , says Stander , maybe 30 or 40 seconds .
He later saw several people going up and down the stairs , and believed they were police officers .
Some were in civilian clothes , some in uniform .
( The defence has argued that items in the athlete 's bedroom â€ “ fans , a duvet â€ “ were moved by police . )
Stander says Pistorius was desperate to save Steenkamp 's life
â€ “
he put his fingers in her mouth , begged her to stay with him .
I saw the truth there that morning.ï » ¿ Oldwage is asking Stander what he observed of Pistorius in the immediate aftermath of Steenkamp 's death .
It is not something I would like to experience again â€ ¦
The expression on his face , the expression of pain , the expression of sorrow .
He 's crying ,
he 's praying ,
he 's asking god to help him .
He was torn apart , broken , desperate , pleading.ï » ¿ Stander confirms he had given instructions to the security team to call the police .
Oldwage is now going through details of what calls were made from Stander 's mobile phone â€ “ to the emergency services â€ “ and at what times .
Stander is speaking very softly and sounds emotional ( he asked not to be shown on television ) .
The judge has had to ask him to speak up .
Stander is telling the court that Pistorius went upstairs to fetch ID for Steenkamp .
Stander 's daughter went with him .
He says that around 4 am , he ( Stander ) called the athlete 's brother , Carl Pistorius , "" to inform him of the accident "" .
Stander asked Stipp if he had heard anything , as he lived "" just behind "" Pistorius .
Stipp told him he heard four shots , screams , then four shots again .
A neighbour , Johan Stipp , arrived and identified himself as a doctor ( a radiologist ) .
Stipp asked Stander to ring an emergency number .
An ambulance arrived shortly after that and declared Steenkamp dead .
Stander says he and his daughter tried to calm Pistorius down .
He was screaming , he was crying , he was praying .
Stander is relaying how he drove with his daughter to Pistorius ' house .
The front door was slightly open and there was a light on .
His daughter pushed the door open .
We saw Mr Pistorius coming down the stairs with Reeva in his arms .
I could see she had a head woundï»¿.
When Mr Pistorius saw us , there was relief on his face .
When he reached the bottom of the stairs , my daughter asked him to put Reeva down .
He was really crying , he was in pain .
He asked us to please assist him .
Oldwage turns to the night of Steenkamp 's death ; he establishes that Stander was asleep at the time of the shooting , and that he was only minutes away from Pistorius ' house .
I received a call from Mr Pistorius and he said â€ ¦ ' Johan , please , please , come to my house , please .
I shot Reeva .
I thought she was an intruder .
Please , please come quick . '
I stood up , my wife woke up as well â€ ¦
My daughter came out of her room
and she said she 'd just heard somebody screamï»¿. Stander confirms he has known the athlete "" on a personal level "" since 2009 .
Oldwage is taking him through the statements he gave to police â€ “ first to Hilton Botha , the now disgraced , original investigating officer ; then to the state .
I considered myself a state witness at that time .
Oldwage queries why the prosecution then declined to call him as a witness.ï » ¿ As expected , Johan Stander is to be the first witness for the defence today .
Barry Roux , Pistorius ' lead counsel , will not be questioning this witness ; another member of the team , Kenny Oldwage , will do so .
Stander was the first person to arrive at Pistorius ' house on the night of Steenkamp 's death .
Pistorius is in the court and now , too , is the judge .
Court resumes .
Reporters in Pretoria are already gathering in court .
There are reports that the first defence witness to appear this morning will be Johan Stander , the first person Pistorius rang after shooting Steenkamp .
A brief reminder : there is no jury â€ “ Judge Thokozile Masipa will decide on Pistoriusâ€ ™ guilt or innocence .
â€¢ Pistorius does not deny killing Steenkamp .
But he maintains that he thought the person in the locked bathroom was an intruder and that he approached the room with a gun in order to keep himself and his girlfriend safe .
I heard a noise from inside the toilet , what I perceived to be someone coming out of the toilet .
Before I knew it I had fired four shots at the door .
My ears were still ringing â€ “
I couldnâ€
™ t hear anything â€ “
so I kept shouting for Reeva to phone the police .
I was still scared to retreat because I wasnâ€ ™ t sure if there was somebody on the ladder or someone in the toilet .
â€¢ Under cross - examination from prosecutor Gerrie Nel , Pistorius admitted he had â€œno reasonâ€ � to fire the four shots .
Nel : â€œWe know for a fact there were no intruders in your house that night
, we know for a fact there was no ladder against the wall .
We know for a fact that you had no reason to shoot ,
objectively speaking.â€
� Pistorius told the judge :
â€œThatâ€ ™ s correct , my lady.â€ � â€¢ Nel accused the athlete of using his emotional outbursts ( he has frequently wailed and vomited in court ) â€œas an escapeâ€ � from the questioning about his actions on the night Steenkamp was killed .
Pistorius also faced a grilling over his apparent fascination with guns , including a disputed incident where a gun he was holding went off in a restaurant .
â€¢
A defence witness called to dispute the stateâ€ ™ s version of how Steenkamp was killed was labelled â€œirresponsibleâ€ � by Nel , who pointed out that Roger Dixon was not trained in ballistics , light , sound or blood spatter evidence .
â€¢ Three neighbours testified that they heard a woman scream before and during the gunshots in Pistorius 's home , and the pathologist who performed the autopsy on Steenkamp said it would have been "" abnormal "" for her not to scream from some of her injuries .
The defence has claimed that Pistorius fired with "" double - tap "" bursts that gave Steenkamp no time to scream .
Defence counsel Barry Roux has also argued that the athlete screams like a woman when he is anxious .
â€¢
Some commentators thought the state had failed to prove a convincing motive for Pistorius to murder his girlfriend .
The prosecution put forward evidence from WhatsApp chats between the couple to allege that Steenkamp had been â€œscaredâ€ � of her boyfriend .
But Barry Roux countered with a Valentineâ€ ™ s card that Steenkamp had left for Pistorius â€ “ she was killed in the early hours of 14 February â€
“ which read :
â€œRoses are red , violets are blue .
Today is a good day to tell you that â€ ¦ I love you.â€ �
You can read David Smithâ€ ™ s summary of the prosecution case here .
This morning sees the resumption of the trial of Oscar Pistorius , charged with the murder of his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp .
The court hearing â€ “ originally scheduled to finish in March , then April , and currently around 16 May â€ “ has had several pauses and longer breaks ; this most recent due to the prosecutionâ€ ™ s need to attend to other cases .
Today should see the defence continue its case : that the athlete believed it was an intruder , not Steenkamp , in the bathroom , and fired his gun at a locked door in fear of his life .
My colleague David Smith will be in court in Pretoria today and you can read his account of Pistoriusâ€ ™ emotional testimony here .

2014-05-05,"A neighbour of Oscar Pistorius feared he might take his own life immediately after he shot his girlfriend dead , and ran after him to ensure he did not turn his gun on himself , a court has heardon Monday .
Carice Viljoen , who with her father was first on the scene after the shooting on Valentine 's Day last year , said the athlete was in a "" frantic "" state as he fought to stop Reeva Steenkamp bleeding , and prayed to God to save her life .
The testimony from the fifth defence witness came as the case at the high court in Pretoria resumed following a two - week break .
Pistorius , 27 , slumped forward in the dock with his head in his hands as the story was told again .
Viljoen , a legal adviser and friend of Pistorius , who lived 350 - 400 metres from his home , recalled that she had been woken by her dogs barking .
She then heard a man 's voice crying : "" Help !
Help !
Help ! ""
She was scared and joined her father , Johan Stander , in driving to Pistorius 's house , where they were confronted by a scene of horror . ""
The first thing I saw was Oscar carrying Reeva down the stairs , "" she said .
"" We were facing each other .
He was walking rather fast .
He was frantic – ' Carice , please , Carice
, please , can we get her in the car and take her to the hospital ' . ""
He was begging me to put her in the car .
I told him to put her down .
I told him we just need to see what 's going on .
I just saw blood everywhere .
"" I said we need to stop the bleeding .
I proceeded up the stairs to his linen cupboard and I grabbed a few towels .
He was praying to God the whole time ; he was begging Reeva to stay with him .
He was begging and pleading with Reeva : stay with me , my love , stay with me . ""
She said the athlete tried to stem the blood and keep the 29-year - old 's airway open .
At one point , she asked Pistorius what had happened . ""
He just looked at me and he said , ' I thought it was an intruder ' . ""
Viljoen followed Pistorius inside his home when he went to get identity documents because she thought he might kill himself , she added .
"" I thought he was possibly going to shoot himself
so I immediately ran up
but I was scared to go any further , "" she said , wiping away tears .
Earlier on Monday , the court heard testimony from Stander , who was once on the management committee of the gated community in Pretoria where the athlete lived .
He said he had known Pistorius since 2009 and often looked after his home and dogs when he was away competing .
He told the court he received a panicked phone call from the double amputee sprinter at 3.19am ‚ two minutes after the shooting . ""
He said on the call , ' "" Oom ( Uncle ) Johan , please , please , please come to my house .
Please .
I shot Reeva .
I thought she was in an intruder .
Please come quick ' . ""
Stander described seeing the athlete walking down the stairs , carrying Steenkamp 's lifeless body in his arms .
"" I could see she had a head wound .
We tried to calm Mr Pistorius down .
He was screaming , he was crying , he was praying .
He was torn apart , broken , desperate .
"" It 's not something I would like to experience again .
Because that young man walking down the stairs with the lady , with a young woman .
His face .
The expression of pain , the expression of sorrow .
And he 's crying .
"" Stander became emotional as he described Pistorius 's "" committed "" attempt to save Steenkamp 's life as she lay on the floor .
The athlete "" was asking God to help him , "" he recalled .
"" He was torn apart , broken , desperate , pleading .
It 's difficult really to describe . ""
He was really crying , he was in pain , and he asked us to please assist him , to put Reeva in a car and take her to hospital . ""
When he put his fingers in her mouth to try to keep the airway open .
He was devastated .
How he begged God to keep her alive .
I saw the truth there that morning .
I saw it
and I feel it .
He was desperate to save her [ and ] prayed to God . ""
Cross - examining Stander , prosecutor Gerrie Nel asked if he was a good friend of Pistorius and trying to "" assist "" the defence .
Stander replied : "" I 'm here to give the truth .
And I think I 've given the truth .
What I saw that morning .
"" Nel also pressed Stander on why he said he assumed that Pistorius had made a mistake when Pistorius had not used the word on the phone call . ""
He never said I accidentally shot her , "" Nel said .
"" He said [ he ] thought she was an intruder . ""
Stander said it was his "" understanding "" that Pistorius had shot Steenkamp in error .
The witness also testified about previous break - ins at the estate but was forced to admit under cross - examination that it was "" generally a safe place "" .
Sitting in the public gallery as usual , Steenkamp 's mother June was visibly upset during testimony about her daughter 's body being carried down the stairs .
The prosecution alleges Pistorius knowingly killed Steenkamp , a model and law graduate , by firing four times through a locked toilet door after the couple and argument .
Under days of withering cross - examination last month , Pistorius appeared to change his defence .
He initially told the court he opened fire because he thought Steenkamp was an intruder .
But later he said he panicked and fired the four shots accidentally .
Among the witnesses expected to give evidence this week is a psychologist who will speak to the athlete 's physical vulnerability .
The case continues ."
2014-05-06,"Oscar Pistorius has been accused of trying to intimidate a friend of Reeva Steenkamp by turning to her in court and asking : "" How can you sleep at night ?
""
The South African Paralympian who is on trial for Steenkamp 's murder , flatly denied speaking to Kim Myers but witnesses , including a police officer , claimed they heard Pistorius as he left the dock during an adjournment .
A complaint was lodged with South Africa 's national prosecuting authority .
Ian Levitt , a lawyer , said : "" My client Kim Myers was approached by Oscar Pistorius in court today and , in a very sinister tone , was asked : ' How can you sleep at night ? '
My client views this unwelcome approach as extremely disturbing and I have been in communication with the national prosecuting authorities as well as the investigating officer .
All other parties have been informed .
My client will remain focused on the trial and will continue to attend court in support of Reeva . ""
Steenkamp , a model and law graduate , was a close friend of Myers and lived with her family in the months before being shot dead by her boyfriend at the age of 29 .
Myers was among those called to identify Steenkamp 's body hours after she was shot dead by Pistorius .
Asked why the athlete might have approached his client , Levitt suggested Pistorius may have been upset by interviews the Myers had previously given to the media in which they expressed concern about the intensity of his relationship with Steenkamp . ""
Reeva was living with the Myers and they did make statements â€ “
he might be upset because of what they said , might have the slanted view that they 're against him .
"" Myers was shocked by what happened , he added .
"" She wants to continue to be in court in support of Reeva
but it 's very upsetting and disturbing .
""
Myers ' mother , Desi , who regularly sits beside her in the public gallery , was said to be furious about the incident .
Police warrant officer Barend van Staden confirmed that he had heard Pistorius say : "" How can you sleep at night ? "" and reported it to the chief prosecutor , Gerrie Nel .
But when reporters questioned Pistorius about the claim , he replied : "" No , I have n't spoken to her "" .
Pressed further , he insisted : "" I have n't spoken to them for a year and a half .
I walk past them in the corridors and hold doors open for them but they do n't look me in the eye . ""
Told of Pistorius 's denial , Levitt replied : "" Not only is she standing by what he said , but she finds it unfathomable that he denies it in front of a number of witnesses . ""
He 's denied a whole lot of things .
He 's in a big process of denial .
I understand he said it in the presence of some witnesses so his denial is obviously a lie . ""
Brian Webber , a member of Pistorius 's legal team , said : "" It 's grossly untrue .
I 'm not even going to dignify that with a comment .
He never said anything of the sort . ""
Pistorius is accused of murdering Steenkamp at his home in Pretoria on Valentine 's Day last year .
He claims he panicked because he thought he heard an intruder .
The runner initially told the court that he shot Steenkamp through a locked toilet door , thinking she was an intruder .
But he later changed his testimony to say he fired the four shots accidentally .
Nel has accused the athlete of "" tailoring "" his evidence , calling his account of the killing a lie .
Earlier on Tuesday the high court in Pretoria heard from three of Pistorius 's closest neighbours , all of whom said they heard a man crying on the night Steenkamp was shot and described it as a "" high - pitched cry "" .
All three testified that they did not hear a woman screaming .
The two female witnesses were asked by the defence counsel , Barry Roux , to replicate the cry they heard that night .
Each made a high - pitched , anguished scream that filled the courtroom .
Michael Nhlengethwa told the court Pistorius introduced Steenkamp to him as "" my fiancÃ
© e "" days before she was killed â€ “ "" a claim that was not explored further "" â€ “ and that the athlete would be moving to Johannesburg to be closer to her .
The trial continues ."
2014-05-06,"David Smith has filed a report from the high court in Pretoria ; you can read it here .
He writes that Pistorius has denied attempting to intimidate Kim Myers , a friend of Reeva Steenkamp , in court today by asking her : "" How can you sleep at night ?
"" Myers ' mother , Desi , who regularly sits beside her in the public gallery , was said to be furious about the incident .
Police warrant officer Barend van Staden confirmed that he had heard Pistorius say : "" How can you sleep at night ? "" and reported it to the chief prosecutor , Gerrie Nel .
But when reporters questioned Pistorius about the claim , he replied : "" No , I have n't spoken to her . ""
That 's it for the live blog for today .
A reminder : the court is not sitting on Wednesday , as it 's a public holiday for the South African general election .
The trial will resume on Thursday 8 May.
My colleague David Smith , who has been in court in Pretoria , has some more details on this allegation that Pistorius acted in an intimidating manner towards Kim Myers , a friend of Steenkamp , today :
The NPA is the National Prosecuting Authority of South Africa , which has the power to institute criminal proceedings on behalf of the state .
I should repeat that one of Pistorius ' lawyers and the athlete himself have denied the incident .
South African media is reporting that one of Reeva Steenkamp 's friends , Kim Myers , who has been in court to follow the trial , was upset today after the athlete allegedly muttered to her : "" How do you sleep at night ? ""
The comment was allegedly made today during a break in court proceedings , although it was not heard by reporters in the room .
Brian Webber , a member of Pistorius ' legal team , told reporters : "" I 'm not even going to dignify that with a comment .
It 's grossly untrue .
He never said anything of the sort . ""
Pistorius himself also denied it : Once again , the court has wrapped up early , after the defence witnesses finished their evidence more swiftly than expected .
Today the court heard from three of Pistorius ' closest neighbours , none of whom were called by the state : Michael Nhlengethwa and Eontle Nhlengethwa , who live next door to the athlete ; and Rika Motshuane , whose house is behind Pistorius ' property .
â€¢ The three witnesses all heard a man crying on the night Steenkamp was shot and that it was a "" high - pitched cry "" .
The defence claims that prosecution witnesses who previously told the court they heard a woman 's scream had in fact heard Pistorius , who it says screams like a woman when distressed .
Michael Nhlengethwa said the man 's cry was "" very high "" .
â€¢ The two female witnesses were asked by the defence counsel , Barry Roux , to replicate the cry they heard that night .
Each made a high - pitched , anguished scream .
â€¢ All three testified that they did not hear a woman screaming .
â€¢ Michael Nhlengethwa told the court Pistorius introduced Reeva Steenkamp to him as "" my fiancÃ
© e "" days before she was killed , and that he would be moving to Johannesburg to be closer to her .
â€¢ Michael Nhlengethwa did not hear any shots .
His wife , Eontle Nhlengethwa , said she heard a loud bang , which woke her up .
State prosecutor Gerrie Nel suggested this bang was from the second set of sounds â€ “ described by some earlier witnesses as gunshots , but which the defence says were the thumps of the cricket bat breaking down the toilet door
â€ “ and thus after Steenkamp had been shot .
Motshuane did not hear any shots .
â€¢ Michael Nhlengethwa said initial approaches made by police officers after the shooting were informal and rude and he initially declined to talk to them .
He later gave a statement to Captain Mike Van Aardt .
â€¢ Roux has told the judge , despite the frequent adjournments and early finishes , that he believes the defence could conclude its case by next Tuesday .
Roux has run out of witnesses again .
He asks that Nel puts forward more questions to his witnesses when the court is back on Thursday ( the court is not sitting on Wednesday as it is a public holiday for the South African general election ) .
The court adjourns until Thursday morning .
I will post a summary of today 's evidence shortly .
Nel asks if she has been following the case on the television .
She has , she says , after she was told the court â€ “ presumably the prosecution â€ “ would not be calling her to give evidence .
Nel asks if she heard gunshots .
She did not .
The state has nothing further .
The defence has n't either .
So Rika Motshuane is excused .
Motshuane insists she only heard a man crying .
She says she did not hear a woman screaming .
Roux has finished .
Nel now starts cross - examination for the state .
Motshuane says Officer Hilton Botha â€ “ the original lead investigator in the case â€ “ later approached her for a statement .
( Botha was dropped from the case after it emerged that he was facing attempted murder charges in a separate case . )
Motshuane continues .
She and her husband were panicking , she says ; they did not dare to switch on the lights .
They heard a car outside .
She shows the court on a photograph the bedroom window from which she looked out , facing the street where Pistorius ' house is .
She saw the Mini Cooper belonging to Carice Viljoen .
They could n't get back to sleep , she says .
They could hear more cars , including the security car .
She decided to phone security to find out what had happened , but nobody answered the phone .
Her husband later got through and was told security was taking care of the situation .
They went back to bed .
Motshuane says she was woken in the early hours of 14 February .
I heard a man crying .
To me , my lady , it was a cry of pain .
I woke my husband up .
I said , do you hear ?
He said yes , but I thought I was dreaming .
I said the crying is real .
I was panicking â€ ¦ ï»¿I
said it could be that one of the security guards has been shot .
We were all frightened .
The crying was very loud and very close .
I even thought it could be in the house .
Roux asks her to attempt to replicate the cry she heard .
She wails , in a high - pitched voice .
Motshuane says she met Pistorius only once , in 2008 , when she moved into her home on the estate .
He came round to welcome them ; they were n't in
so they later went to his house , briefly , to say hello .
She and her husband lived in the house directly behind that of Pistorius .
The next witness is on the stand .
As expected , she is Rika Motshuane , another of Pistorius ' next - door neighbours .
The next witness is due to be Rika Motshuane , another of Pistorius ' neighbours .
She lives next door to him , on the other side to the Nhlengethwas .
Roux is apologising for the lateness of the next witness ; like yesterday , he had thought the first two witnesses would spend longer giving evidence .
The court will break until she arrives ( there are problems with parking , he says ) .
She will be the last witness today .
Nel jokes that nobody has ever accused him of not "" asking enough questions "" before , but does not object to another 30-minute adjournment .
In mitigation , Roux insists his defence case is well within its timetable and he believes he can finish by Tuesday next week .
Nel cites the evidence of Dr Stipp â€ “ he testified that he heard "" help , help , help "" after the second set of bang sounds ( the ones the defence claims were in fact the cricket bat on the door ) .
He suggests to Nhlengethwa that the bang she heard must have been from this second set â€ “ that is , after Steenkamp had already been shot .
The questioning of Eontle Nhlengethwa is finished .
The prosecutor is struggling to get more detail about the kind of noises the witness heard .
Nel :
This bang sound you heard â€ ¦ what can you remember of the sound ?
Nhlengthwa :
There is no other way I can explain it .
It was just a bang sound.ï » ¿ Nel is still questioning Eontle Nhlengethwa .
He is focusing on the bang and "" help , help , help "" she heard .
Reporters in court in Pretoria say there is much speculation about why the defence witnesses we 've heard from today and yesterday were not called by the prosecution ; all were originally slated to be state witnesses .
Today 's witnesses â€ “ Michael Nhlengethwa and Eontle Nhlengethwa â€ “ were Pistorius ' closest neighbours .
Yesterday 's witnesses â€
“
Johan Stander and his daughter Carice Viljoen â€
“ were the first people on the scene , and had expected to be called for the prosecution .
There is , as I mentioned earlier , also the curious omission from both state and defence witness lists of Frank Chiziweni , Pistorius ' housekeeper , who was in the house on the night Steenkamp was killed .
Court takes a half - hour break .
Nel 's line of questioning is suggesting this witness â€ “ having heard only one bang , then "" help , help , help "" â€ “ in fact heard only the second set of bangs , and might have missed the inital gun shots and the woman 's screams that other neighbours say they heard .
Nhlengethwa is insistent : she never heard a woman scream .
Nel :
The way I understand your evidence , the first noise you heard was a bang â€ ¦ only one ?
Nhlengethwa :
Yes .
Nel :
And after that you heard "" help , help , help "" and a man cry ?
ï»¿Nhlengethwa :
Yes .
Nel :
It 's interesting that more people heard "" help , help , help "" â€
¦
Mr Stipp heard "" help , help , help "" just after the second [ set ] of the shots he heard .
( Nel then clarifies to say "" sounds "" instead of "" shots "" â€ “ the defence has argued that this second set was in fact the noise of the cricket bat against the door . )
Mrs Nhlengethwa confirms her husband 's testimony that he went over to Pistorius ' house ; she stayed inside .
Roux has finished and Nel takes over questioning for the state .
Eontle Nhlengethwa says she heard somebody crying : "" Help , help , help .
"" It was very loud , she adds , "" a male person 's voice "" .
This was while her husband was checking their house .
Roux asks the witness to "" make a sound that resembles "" the crying she heard .
She makes a high - pitched cry , adding "" but in the voice of a man "" .
Eontle Nhlengethwa confirms she did not socialise with Pistorius .
She did not know Steenkamp and had never met her .
She went to bed around 10 pm , 11 pm on the night Steenkamp was killed ( the shooting took place in the early hours , around 3 am ) .
Roux :
Did something wake you up ?
What was it ?
ï»¿Nhlengethwa :
A bang â€ ¦
It was a very loud sound .
I was n't sure where it was coming from .
I woke my husband and asked if he heard it .
Eontle Nhlengethwa â€ “ the next witness and , like her husband , a close neighbour of Pistorius â€ “ will speak through an interpreter .
She wo n't be televised .
Nel has finished and Roux is back on his feet .
We are once again hearing about the crying :
how loud was it , how did it sound ?
Roux :
If there was a woman screaming very loudly , would you have heard it ?
Nhlengethwa says if it was at that time , he would have heard it , but he did not hear a woman scream .
This witness is now stepping down .
His wife looks to be
next.ï
» ¿ Nel :
It is the defence case that if you hit a door with a cricket bat , it sounds like a gun shot â€ ¦
But you never heard any of those things ?
Nhlengethwa
: I gave my statement based on what I heard â€
¦
I did not hear those things.ï » ¿ The court is back after a short break .
Nel is pressing Nhlengethwa on the lights that were on in his house and his view to Pistorius ' property .
Nel says he could n't ask Pistorius on the night if it was him who had shot Steenkamp , due to the state the athlete was in .
Nel 's team has found the quote he wanted .
Pistorius actually said : I 've never screamed like that.ï » ¿ Roux points out this does not mean , as Nel claimed , that he had never screamed as loud in his life .
Nel insists this is open to interpretation .
Judge Masipa says it is best to stick to what is actually on the court record .
Nel is repeating some of the evidence given by other neighbours of a woman screaming and four gun shots .
Nhlengethwa says he did not hear a woman screaming .
ï » ¿ I did not really hear anything in terms of the gun shots .
I was making the call [ to security ] in terms of the crying .
Nel says Pistorius claimed he "" screamed as loud as he ever had "" in his life .
Roux disputes that .
Nel searches through his notes for the quote but gives up .
An assistant starts to look through the paperwork as Nel continues his questions .
June Steenkamp , mother of Reeva Steenkamp , is once again in court to hear the details around her daughter 's death .
Nel presses him on the crying he heard ; Nhlengethwa says it was crying he heard and not screaming .
But he confirms he did not mention screaming in his previous consultation with Nel .
Nhlengethwa confirms he never heard any shots .
Nel :
Did you hear any sounds that could have emanated from him [ Pistorius ] breaking down the door with a cricket bat ?
Nhlengethwa : I did n't hear that , I did n't hear any sounds of that kind .
ï»¿[My
wife ] did n't mention she heard any bangs .
Nhlengethwa says he found it surprising that neighbours much further away
â€ “ up to 170 m
â€ “ heard the shots and screams to which they 've testified in court .
Nel starts with discussions he previously had with Nhlengethwa .
Nhlengethwa says : Oscar is my neighbour .
There 's no way I would turn blind eye to the case .
I will not come to this court and say I have not been watching it , it would not be telling the truth.ï » ¿ Nhlengethwa says he offered to leave when Van Aardt spoke with his wife , but the police captain told him he was OK to stay .
HIs wife made a statement that she had heard a man shouting : "" Help , help , help . ""
Nhlengethwa says he did not hear those words .
The defence has finished questioning this witness ; now it 's over to Gerrie Nel for the state .
The witness says he wanted to talk to "" a credible person "" .
He was afraid his statement would end up in the press and was concerned about "" media hype "" .
The third approach from police was formal and he gave a statement to Captain Mike Van Aardt , the lead detective on the case .
Nhlengethwa says he was approached the next day by someone he assumes he was a police officer , but says the man did not introduce himself properly .
He did not like the way the officer approached him
â€ “
â€œhey brother , what happened here?â€
�
â€ “ so said he would not talk to him unless he went about it properly .
The next day , two officers came , but again approached him on his driveway , which Nhlengethwa again rebuffed , thinking it was too informal and inappropriate .
He asked them to come to his house and make a proper appointment . ""
They never came back . ""
After Steenkamp was taken out on a stretcher , Nhlengethwa stayed for a few more minutes but there was nothing for him to do , so he went home .
When the stretcher was taken out I knew she was no more .
Nhlengethwa says he saw Pistorius kneeling over "" the lady "" ; he was crying and "" there was blood everywhere "" .
Dr Stipp was trying to help her .
I could see he [ Pistorius ] was â€ ¦ saying , please , please help her .
I could see it was quite bad.ï
» ¿ Nhlengethwa 's call to security was at 3.16am .
The crying went on as he made the call , he says , and continued afterwards .
He then heard a car drive up and saw a security vehicle .
He says the security car stopped first at the house of Dr Stipp , the doctor neighbour who tried to help Steenkamp at the scene .
The witness says he realised the crying ( which was still going on ) was probably coming from Pistorius ' house .
He decided it was safe to go over there .
The question for me was , is Oscar
OK?ï
» ¿ Nhlengethwa says he could hear the man shouting "" please , please , no "" .
His wife did not want him to go out to see what was going on , so he phoned security .
Initially it was engaged .
When he got through he asked them to quickly come to his house , that a man was crying and desperate for help .
We 've turned to the night Steenkamp was shot .
Roux establishes that Nhlengethwa 's balcony is around 11 m from Pistorius ' bathroom window , then asks him what he heard on the night in question .
Nhlengethwa says he was woken by his wife , who 'd heard a bang .
He checked on his daughter , who was asleep , then he checked the house , to see if the doors were locked .
He realised the sound had come from outside .
Then we started hearing a man crying very loud â€ ¦ Something was wrong .
We started panicking .
There is a difference between normal crying and crying when you are in danger , when you need help .
We felt probably he was in danger .
It was very loud .
Roux presses him on whether it was a low - pitched voice or a high - pitched one ; Nhlengethwa says it was "" very high "" .
The defence has previously claimed that other neighbours who claimed to have heard a woman 's screams in fact heard Pistorius , who it says screams like a woman when distressed .
Nhlengethwa says Steenkamp was introduced to him by Pistorius as "" my fiancee "" .
He says he told the athlete : "" This one is for keeps . ""
Nhlengethwa says he and Pistorius were friendly , but did not socialise :
Oscar is the type of person who if he sees me , he will stop , get out of his car and greet me .
They had a shared love of cars , he says .
Nhlengethwa says he met Reeva Steenkamp only once , on the Sunday before she died .
I raised my hand to greet her â€
¦
She just opened her arms , she came to hug me .
I could see the person that she was.ï » ¿
We expect a full set of witnesses today , given yesterday 's early finish after the two witnesses went through their evidence very quickly .
The first witness , Michael Nhlengethwa , is Pistorius ' closest neighbour â€ “ "" right next to "" the athlete 's house , says defence counsel Barry Roux .
He 's another who was listed originally as a state witness but was not called .
Curiously , Monday 's court hearing also witnessed the first mention of Pistorius ' housekeeper , who was in the athlete 's house on the night Steenkamp was shot .
Frank Chiziweni , who is from Malawi , is understood to have been asleep in his quarters next to the kitchen , the Telegraph reports this morning .
Giving evidence for the defence on Monday , Carice Viljoen was the first person to refer to Chiziweni â€ “ whom she mentioned only by his first name â€ “ saying that when she arrived at Pistorius ' house , Frank was standing in the road .
Chiziweni is understood to have told police he heard nothing at all .
It does seem surprising that this is the first time the presence of another person in the house has been raised during this trial , particularly given the testimony given by various neighbours â€ “ who were presumably further away â€ “ about the shouts , screams and shots
they say they heard .
The Telegraph reports Barry Roux , Pistorius 's lead defence counsel , saying he would not be calling Chiziweni to give evidence : â€œHe says he was asleep .
Weâ€ ™ re not going to be calling him.â€ �
Chiziweni was listed as a potential state witness , but was not called by the prosecution either .
The court should hear today from more witnesses for the defence .
Monday 's hearing was a short one , as the two witnesses called by Pistorius ' legal team went through their evidence "" at the speed of light "" and no more witnesses were available .
But as the first two people on the scene in the immediate aftermath of the shooting of Reeva Steenkamp , the evidence given by Johan Stander and his daughter , Carice Viljoen , was compelling .
â€¢ Stander revealed details of the call Pistorius made to him immediately after the shooting .
ï»¿Johan , please , please , come to my house , please .
I shot Reeva .
I thought she was an intruder .
Please , please come quick .
â€¢ Viljoen , who was living at her parents ' house on the same estate as Pistorius , said she was woken by a man 's voice shouting and described her fear and initial reluctance to act : I could n't pinpoint where it [ the shouting ] was coming from .
It was clear somebody needed help .
I closed my door , I closed my blind , I got back into my bed â€
¦
I was thinking , I do n't know how to help the person who 's in trouble .
â€¢
Both testified that they had arrived at Pistorius ' house to find him carrying a bleeding Steenkamp down the stairs and that the athlete was crying , screaming and begging for help .
Viljoen told the court : "" There was blood everywhere . ""
â€¢ Stander said a neighbour , Dr Johan Stipp , had told him he had heard four shots , screaming , then another four shots .
Dr Stipp haspreviously told the court he heard three loud bangs .
I was very concerned .
You can not shoot eight shots at someone , even an intruder.ï » ¿ â€¢
Both Stander and Viljoen gave evidence of several people â€ “ neighbours , friends , police in uniform and civilian clothes
â€ “ entering and leaving the house .
Viljoen said nobody was controlling who came and went .
The defence alleges that crucial evidence in Pistorius ' bedroom was tampered with by police officers .
â€¢ Viljoen followed Pistorius upstairs inside his home when he went to get identity documents for Steenkamp because she thought he might kill himself : "" I thought he was possibly going to shoot himself
so I immediately ran up
but I was scared to go any further . ""
â€¢
The defence queried why â€ “ despite being interviewed as witnesses for the state , and having considered themselves as such â€ “ neither Stander nor Viljoen were called by the prosecution .
Stander said he was told he would not be needed as his daughter would be called and the state would need only one person from the family .
But she was not called .

2014-05-06,"The new South Africa goes on trial again this week .
Twice .
On Monday , Oscar Pistorius returned to court to buttress his charge that this was a country so ravaged by crime that he had to arm himself to the teeth in expectation of murderous burglars .
On Wednesday , 25 million registered voters will go to the polls – the first since Nelson Mandela died in December and the fifth in our 20-year - old democracy .
Both events are being watched closely .
Pistorius , who rose against massive odds to teach the world a new way of looking at disability , is an obsession for South Africa and the world .
And as South Africa votes in a new government , the question niggles : where is the country heading ?
Can it fulfil its promise as a beacon of prosperity and progressive governance in the world ?
This is one of those weeks where South Africa gives watchers across the globe their regular dose of its "" one minute before midnight "" scenarios : is this the tipping point ?
Twenty years after Nelson Mandela cajoled , threatened and shouted down even his own comrades and led us down the path of freedom , his successor Jacob Zuma has been crisscrossing the country campaigning to be re - elected .
In answer to virtually every question , he trots out his party 's election slogan : "" We have a goooooood story to tell . ""
The masses imitate him , and so do the middle classes .
But how good a story do we have to tell ?
If there is one thing South Africans agree on , it is that our country is a far better place than the monstrosity it was before 1994 .
The fruits of freedom are numerous and real for many of us : a country where we walk proudly , without fear ; a full citizenship of the world ; a democratic dispensation and constitution to be proud of .
For the government , there is also much to trumpet on economic transformation , on access to health and education , and in relatively harmonious race relations .
For a black man who grew up under apartheid , it is unimaginable to even dare to compare : I grew up with stories of my father and my brother being arrested or harassed because they were in a "" white area "" .
We were not human under apartheid , we were a cipher .
Now , my humanity and dignity has been restored and – as Archbishop Desmond Tutu once said – the humanity of the perpetrators has also been restored .
So as South Africa celebrates its 20 years of democracy the question is how much better could our story have been .
The truth is that the shine is coming off our rainbow nation .
Every day now there are dozens of protests across the country over poor or absent services .
Unemployment remains as intractable as it was 20 years ago ( 36 % are out of work ) .
The state of education remains parlous .
South Africa is one of the top five most unequal societies in the world today .
The economy is anaemic , growing at a mere 1.9 % last year compared with averages of 5 % across the African continent .
But the shine of the new South Africa really came off in the five years of Zuma 's leadership , though .
Corruption is rife , with the scandal of the president 's private home receiving "" security upgrades "" of about £ 20 m becoming the main motif of the election .
Other clouds loom .
A pernicious secrecy law is awaiting Zuma 's signature .
The police are under the spotlight after the daylight killing of 34 mineworkers at the Marikana mine in August 2012 .
A handful of former ANC ministers have become so disgusted with their party they are calling on citizens to vote for smaller parties or spoil their vote .
As Thabo Mbeki , Mandela 's successor , said in the early 2000s , South Africa is still a country of two worlds : the first rich and white , the second poor and black .
It is a reality every visitor to our country sees , and which ordinary South Africans are beginning to question .
New political parties such as former ANC firebrand Julius Malema 's Economic Freedom Fighters – which calls for nationalisation of the economy and expropriation of white land without compensation – are tapping into this disquiet .
A look back at the past 20 years is bittersweet .
We have come so far , achieved so much , and yet have fallen so far short of truly transforming our country .
At an election debate , Congress of South African Trade Unions leader Zwelinzima Vavi , a fierce critic of corruption , told a minister who tried to defend Zuma 's home improvements : "" If you want people to believe in the future then you must be honest about the present . ""
The truth about South Africa today is that there are elements of a good story , as the ANC puts it .
But that story is marred by how much better we could have been – and how much further we could have travelled – had we not allowed the twin evils of corruption and poor leadership to enter and settle into our political firmament ."
2014-05-08,
2014-05-08,"Day 28 of the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp has finished .
Here is what we heard today : â€¢ Three witnesses for the defence gave evidence : anaesthetist Professor Christina Lundgren ; social worker and probation officer Yvette Van Schalkwyk ; and ballistics expert
Thomas ' Wollie ' Wolmarans , who has yet to finish his testimony and will continue on Friday .
â€¢ Wolmarans told the court that the ammunition used to shoot Steenkamp was not Black Talon bullets , as previously heard , but ranger bullets .
The "" mushroom "" effect on flesh is the same , he says .
The ballistics expert also told the court he had been unable to obtain the exact same bullets to perform later tests : â€¢ Wolmarans said testimony from state witnesses about the bullet holes and wounds had failed to take into account deflections from the wood and curve of the door .
Tests he carried out on wood splintering indicate Steenkamp was very close behind the door when she was shot , he said .
â€¢ Yvette Van Schalkwyk was a late addition to the witness list , coming forward only on Tuesday in response to allegations that Pistorius was "" putting on a show "" with his emotional outbursts in court .
The social worker was assigned to support Pistorius from his earliest court appearances .
What I saw from the first time I saw him was a man who was heartbroken â€ ¦
He cried , he was in mourning , he suffered emotionally .
He was very sorry for the loss , especially for the parents , what they were going through.ï » ¿ â€¢
But prosecutor Gerrie Nel queried Van Schalkwyk 's claim that Pistorius had said sorry , arguing he was sorry only for himself , and not for what he had done .
â€¢ Lundgren cast doubt on the state 's claims that Reeva Steenkamp must have eaten no more than two hours before her death , claiming that gastric emptying was "" not an exact science "" .
She described the post - mortem report that concluded Steenkamp had eaten at 1 am or later as "" purely speculative "" .
There were several reasons â€ “ including the type of food eaten , and the fact Steenkamp had done yoga before going to sleep â€ “ why gastric emptying could be delayed , she said .
The defence says Steenkamp ate around 7 pm , and she and Pistorius went to sleep at 10 pm .
The court will resume on Friday morning .
Wolmarans is still in the middle of his testimony , which he will continue on Friday morning .
Roux asks the judge that Wolmarans ' report not be published , as it contains "" sensitive "" pictures , presumably of Steenkamp .
I will post a summary of the day 's developments shortly .
Wolmarans is talking about the injury â€ “ "" contusion "" - to Steenkamp 's right buttock .
The state claimed it was from a bullet ricochet .
A previous defence witness , Roger Dixon , said it was the result of Steenkamp falling back on to a magazine rack .
Wolmarans says it is not possible to determine with certainty what position Steenkamp was in when the shots were fired , but says the hip wound is consistent with her being upright and leaning forward when she was hit by the first bullet .
This corresponds with bullet hole A in the door .
The state evidence from Captain Mangena suggested the bullet from hole B in the door missed Steenkamp .
Wolmarans says this bullet was likely to have caused the wound in Steenkamp 's arm .
With that , the court finishes for the day .
Wolmarans will continue his evidence on Friday .
Roux talks through Wolmarans ' report , detailing fragments of bullets , bone and wood that were found at the scene .
The witness says a wound on Steenkamp 's chest was consistent with being struck by a bullet ( jacket ) fragment that was recovered from her vest .
This is consistent with the evidence of Gert Saayman , the state pathologist .
Wolmarans now turns to marks on the door said to have been caused by the cricket bat Pistorius used to break down the door .
The marks are consistent with that , he says .
In tests , the witness boards were placed at different distances behind the door .
It can be inferred that the right upper - arm of the deceased was between 6 cm and 20 cm behind the door [ when she was shot].ï » ¿ Wolmarans has brought to court four witness boards that he used in tests to show the pattern of wood splinters from bullets fired through the door .
Wolmarans says he can match splinter patterns to that seen around the wound on Steenkamp 's arm .
Wolmarans obtained another door from Pistorius ' property â€ “ a pantry door similar in style , material and dimensions to the toilet door â€ “ on which to conduct tests .
He wanted to check whether the abrasions and secondary wounds found on Steenkamp 's body could have bee caused by wood splinters from the door .
He could not test with the exact ammunition used by Pistorius as it is a "" collector 's item "" , so had to use a similar type : I tried all over but no firearm dealer has got the one with the black tip .
Captain Mangena used a laser to connect a hole in the door labelled B ( the four shots through the door are referred to as A , B , C , D ) to a ricochet mark labelled E.
This ignores the likelihood of deflection , Wolmarans says .
He gives a very detailed explanation of how the bullets turn and move through the air and surfaces .
Mangena did not use the laser to see if any of the other bullet holes could have caused the ricochet mark .
Wolmarans is giving a number of reasons why assumptions about the trajectory of the bullets might not be accurate :
The "" intermediate target "" â€ “ that is , the wooden door â€ “ could have caused the final destination of the bullets to vary by up to a couple of centimetres , Wolmarans says .
He found a curve in the wood that could also have caused a deflection .
The damaged toilet door was reconstructed , Wolmarans is explaining .
He talks about the measurements made by Captain Christian Mangena to ascertain bullet trajectories , and says he agrees with them .
There was a very small grouping [ of bullet holes ] on the door .
Not very wide .
The door panels were broken out .
The door would have caused "" a small deflection "" in the trajectory of the bullets , Wolmarans says .
It would have been difficult for the door to have been precisely reconstructed , he adds , making it hard to determine a completely accurate reading of the bullet holes .
The witness says these bullets would not "" mushroom "" when hitting a hard surface , such as wood , but that would affect its velocity , and perhaps the direction in which it travels .
Wolmarans says the ammunition used was not Black Talon bullets , as previously heard , but ranger bullets .
The effect is the same , he says .
Wolmarans is now talking about the Winchester bullets that killed Steenkamp : It forms like a mushroom when it hits soft flesh
â€
¦
It makes a largerï » ¿ wound â€ ¦ a permanent cavity .
Wolmarans is explaining how the gun works when fired : As soon as you pull the trigger â€ ¦ it makes an explosion .
The bullet is pushed through the barrel â€ ¦ the slide moves backwards , the cartridge is ejected , then the slide moves forward again

It can be fired in single shots or "" double - taps "" .
( The defence argues that Pistorius fired with "" double - tap "" bursts that gave Steenkamp no time to scream , and so Pistorius did not realise he was shooting at Steenkamp . )
Defence counsel Barry Roux is quizzing ballistics expert Wolmarans about the firearm that was used to shoot Reeva Steenkamp .
It can be loaded with 17 rounds of ammunition 19 mm long and 9 mm diameter .
It looks as if we are to get a full day 's proceedings today for the first time this week , following early finishes on Monday and Tuesday , and a public holiday for elections on Wednesday .
The defence has so far called three witnesses : anaesthetist Professor Christina Lundgren ; social worker and probation officer Yvette Van Schalkwyk ; and ballistics expert Thomas ' Wollie ' Wolmarans .
â€¢ Yvette Van Schalkwyk was a surprise witness , only coming forward on Tuesday to offer evidence .
She was assigned to support Pistorius from his earliest court appearances .
What I saw from the first time I saw him was a man who was heartbroken â€ ¦
He cried , he was in mourning , he suffered emotionally .
He was very sorry for the loss , especially for the parents , what they were going through.ï
» ¿ â€¢ Van Schalkwyk said she had come forward as she was upset at suggestions Pistorius had been "" putting on a show "" with his emotional outbursts during his trial .
The athlete had cried and vomited after his early bail hearings , she said .
But she dismissed reports that he had been suicidal , saying he was "" heartbroken "" .
â€¢ State prosecutor Gerrie Nel queried Van Schalkwyk 's claim that Pistorius had said sorry , arguing he was sorry only for himself , and not for what he had done .
Nel :
He never said he was sorry he killed her .
Van Schalkwyk :
No.ï » ¿ â€¢ Professor Lundgren cast doubt on the state 's claims that Reeva Steenkamp must have eaten no more than two hours before her death , claiming that gastric emptying was "" not an exact science "" .
She described the post - mortem report that concluded Steenkamp had eaten at 1 am or later as "" purely speculative "" .
There were several reasons â€ “ including the type of food eaten , and the fact Steenkamp had done yoga before going to sleep â€ “ why gastric emptying could be delayed , she said .
The defence says Steenkamp ate around 7 pm , and she and Pistorius went to sleep at 10 pm .
â€¢
The court has begun hearing the evidence of forensics and ballistics expert Thomas Wolmarans , who took over the crime scene after the police had left .
In his testimony so far , he told the court he found a bullet fragment in the toilet bowl in Pistorius ' bathroom that police officers had missed .
Wolmarans will continue his evidence after the lunch break .
Wolmarans will continue his evidence in an hour 's time .
I will post a summary of this morning 's evidence shortly .
Wolmarans turns to 14 February 2013 , the night Steenkamp was killed .
He took over the crime scene after the police had left ; the main toilet door had been removed "" for the purpose of safekeeping "" .
Wolmarans later removed a fragment of a bullet from the toilet bowl .
"" This was a core that 's inside .
A bullet has got a jacket . ""
He handed it to police ( who had , presumably , missed it ) .
We are running through Wolmarans ' extensive CV and firearms experience :
Roux turns to two disputed points of evidence : whether Pistorius was on his prostheses when he fired the shots , and the distance the accused was from the bathroom door .
He says these issues have now been resolved and accepted â€ “ the athlete was on his stumps when he fired , and not 1.5 m from door â€ “ but not before Wolmarans was asked to investigate them .
Thomas ' Wollie ' Wolmarans takes the stand .
The ballistics expert has no objection to being televised .
He says his first language is Afrikaans ; he will give evidence in English but asks that an interpreter be available in case he needs assistance with technical terms .
The next defence witness is ballistics expert Wollie Wolmarans .
The break is to allow him to set up exhibits .
Nel asks the witness if she felt sorry for Pistorius . ""
After 24 years in probation , you 've got empathy .
There 's a difference , "" she says .
Nel says he does not have a psychologist in court to consult with today on the issues raised by this testimony .
He asks the judge if he can recall this witness if he does later have more questions for her .
The judge agrees ; Nel has no further questions now .
Roux is on his feet again .
What did Pistorius tell Van Schalkwyk had happened on the night he shot Steenkamp ?
He heard a noise and thought it was an intruder , she says .
Yvette Van Schalkwyk is excused .
We have another 10-minute break before the next witness .
Van Schalkwyk says Pistorius told her : "" He could n't think what her parents must be going through , that was also his consideration . ""
June Steenkamp , Reeva Steenkamp 's mother , is in court today , as she has been for most of the trial .
June Steenkamp has said of Pistorius ' emotional outbursts in court : "" I do n't know whether he 's acting . ""
The court is taking another short break .
Nel presses Van Schalkwyk on whether Pistorius showed remorse .
She was not there to assess remorse , she says , but to provide support .
But , says Nel , remorse would mean accepting what he had done ?
Van Schalkwyk agrees with the definition but says she was not there to deal with that part of the case : "" That was n't my function . ""
Did Pistorius say he was sorry , asks Nel ?
He was sorry , insists Van Schalkwyk .
Nel is unconvinced â€ “ "" it was never the evidence that he said he was sorry "" .
Van Schalkwyk :
He was sorry for his loss , he was sorry for her parents .
Nel :
But he never said he was sorry he killed her .
Van Schalkwyk : No.ï » ¿ Nel : ""
I miss Reeva ,
I 'm sorry for her loss
"" â€
¦
It 's all about him .
It 's not "" sorry for what I 've done "" .
Van Schalkwyk : I ca n't say that it was all about him .
He was in a relationship with her .
Van Schalkwyk tells Nel she came forward to give evidence because it upset her that the prosecutor and media had said Pistorius was not sincere .
Nel :
But if somebody shot and killed someone the night before â€ ¦ you would expect such a person to be traumatised ?
Van Schalkwyk :
Yes , that is true .
Later on , says Van Schalkwyk , Pistorius said he accidentally shot Steenkamp .
Nel says this is not consistent with the defence the athlete has put forward in the trial .
He says he thought he was under attack from an intruder , says Nel : this is not the same as saying he accidentally shot her .
Nel starts his cross - examination .
Was Pistorius sorry for himself , he asks Van Schalkwyk .
No , she says , he was sorry for Reeva .
The prosecutor says it is common for people arrested for crimes such as this to be traumatised .
He establishes that Van Schalkwyk has not seen a suspect in a family murder case immediately after arrest before .
Van Schalkwyk says that after earlier court appearances when he applied for bail , Pistorius vomited and broke down crying outside the court room .
Roux has finished his questioning .
Van Schalkwyk continues to read from subsequent reports .
Pistorius was "" giving his full cooperation "" .
He was seeing a psychologist on a regular basis .
He tested negative for prohibited substances .
The reports repeatedly describe the athlete as "" heartbroken "" .
Roux resumes his questioning of Yvette Van Schalkwyk .
Van Schalkwyk filed weekly reports on Pistorius ' health and emotional state as part of his bail conditions .
She is reading from a report dated March 2013 , which says reports should mostly be concerned with his mental health and emotional state .
The report says the memorial for Steenkamp held at the house of Pistorius ' uncle had left him "" emotionally drained "" .
The accused is very heartbroken .
Judge Thokozile Masipa says Nel did ask Pistorius if he was using his emotions as an excuse .
She allows Roux to continue with this witness .
Nel objects and says this evidence is inadmissible .
Roux counters : he says it proves Pistorius was sincere in his emotional state , after Nel accused him of acting .
The defence is entitled to rebut suggestions that Pistorius ' claims were fabricated , he says .
Van Schalkwyk says she did not intend to be a witness but she was "" upset "" by what she read about Pistorius allegedly "" putting on a show "" when he was crying in court .
She came forward on Tuesday â€
“
two days ago â€ “ to say she wanted to testify .
What I saw from the first time I saw him was a man who was heartbroken â€ ¦
He cried , he was in mourning , he suffered emotionally .
He was very sorry for the loss , especially for the parents , what they were going through.ï
» ¿
The defence calls a new witness : Yvette Van Schalkwyk .
Van Schalkwyk is a social worker and probation officer .
In February 2013 , she was asked to assist Pistorius in his first court appearance .
She assumed it was for emotional support and to monitor his behaviour .
She was not acting on behalf of the defence and did not have contact with members of the defence legal team .
Kim Myers , a friend of Steenkamp to whom Pistorius allegedly made an intimidating comment on Tuesday , is back in court today .
Reporters in court say her mother Desi and sister Gina are also present .
Professor Lundgren is excused .
The court is now adjourning for a tea break .
Nel has finished his questions .
Roux is back for the defence .
Roux asks if it is possible to have "" hourly precision "" for stomach emptying .
Lundgren laughs : no , it is not .
She insists again that Saayman 's conclusion that Steenkamp must have eaten around 1 am is "" speculative "" .
Nel is stealthily picking apart the various exceptions that Lundgren suggested could contribute to delayed gastric emptying .
Steenkamp had not drunk alcohol , or taken drugs medical or recreational ; and did not have an eating disorder .
Nel :
In an ideal world â€ ¦ her stomach should have been empty .
Lundgren : Agreed .
Nel :
That must mean Professor Saayman 's evidence is the more probable .
Lundgren :
I 'm not going to speculate on that .
Nel :
I 'm not going to force you .
Lundgren mentioned earlier than anxiety or fear can delay gastric emptying .
Nel :
If the deceased was involved in a long argument before death that made her anxious , that would affect gastric emptying ?
Lundgren :
It could .
There was 200ml of food in Steenkamp 's stomach after death , says Nel ( Lundgren was not aware of this measurement ) .
That means , if that represents 10 % of what she 'd eaten some hours earlier , as Lundgren posited , she must have eaten a meal of 2 litres of food , he suggests .
That 's a lot of food , Lundgren concedes .
If Steenkamp had eaten eight hours before she died â€ “ as the defence says â€ “ she would have had to have eaten 4 litres of food , Nel says .
It 's not probable , he argues .
Nel takes apart the reasons given by Lundgren earlier as possible explanations for delayed gastric emptying : the sleep , the yoga , the type of food eaten .
Nel :
There 's nothing you 've seen that shows deceased was not a normal individual ?
Nel returns to the autopsy evidence from Professor Gert Saayman , whose view was that Steenkamp would have eaten no more than two hours before she died .
Nel asks Lundgren if she is saying Saayman is wrong .
She says she will not criticise his report .
But she repeats her belief that gastric emptying is not a precise science .
Lundgren is still being cross - examined by Nel .
During the break , Nel says he shared with the witness some articles on digestion after death .
She reiterates that she is a clinician whose expertise is with live patients .
She is not a forensic pathologist , she says .
Here 's why the evidence on gastric emptying is so crucial to determining what happened on the night Reeva Steenkamp was shot .
The defence says Steenkamp ate around 7 pm , and she and Pistorius went to sleep at 10 pm .
The prosecution says the stomach contents indicate she ate around 2 am .
They say this suggests the couple were awake â€ “ and arguing â€ “ before the shooting .
It 's not disputed that Steenkamp was shot at around 3 am .
The court should resume in a few minutes .
Nel says Steenkamp 's body was handed over to the mortuary services at 11:45am the morning after the shooting , and was not refrigerated until that point .
Lundgren had said she had been unable to find evidence either way about whether enzymes in the body continue to break down food after death when the body has been refrigerated .
Nel asks for a break so he can consult with Saayman .
The court will resume in half an hour .
Nel says Saayman in the autopsy was able to identify the types of food Steenkamp had eaten .
Nel : Would you not have expected the digestive process to have caused the contents of the stomach to be unrecognisable after eight hours ?
Lundgren :
I ca n't comment on that , my lady .
Nel :
But he [ Saayman ] can .
And he did.ï » ¿ Lundgren says "" insoluble fibres "" in the chicken stir - fry Steenkamp ate on the evening before she died might account for the food still in her stomach at death .
Nel :
But you do n't warn your patients not to eat stir - fries before surgery ?
Laughter in court , but Nel insists : "" It 's not a joke . ""
Lundgren replies : "" I warn them to have a light meal . ""
Professor Gert Saayman , who was responsible for the post - mortem on Steenkamp , is also in court today , listening to Lundgren 's testimony .
Nel says Steenkamp died at 3 am : Nel : After eight hours , you would have expected the stomach to be empty .
In normal circumstances , do n't look for exceptions .
Lundgren :
I do n't think anybody can categorically state that her stomach would have been empty after eight hours.ï » ¿ Roux has finished his questions .
Gerrie Nel begins cross - examination for the state .
He says Lundgren 's list of possible reasons for a delay in the emptying of the contents of Steenkamp 's stomach are themselves "" speculative "" .
We turn to Lundgren 's assessment of the post mortem of Reeva Steenkamp ( she was n't present ; she has read the reports ) .
Based on my expertise and my reading â€ ¦ the meal may have contained insoluble fibre , which may have delayed gastric emptying .
She was a pre - menopausal woman , which may have delayed gastric emptying .
Lundgren says the fact that Steenkamp did yoga before bed , which could have also delayed emptying .
On the state 's case that had Steenkamp eaten when Pistorius said she did â€ “ that is ,
early in the evening â€ “
her stomach would have been empty at the time of death , Lundgren says : One can not state it as being fact
â€ “
I would say it is purely speculative.ï
» ¿ Gastric emptying can be delayed for several reasons , says Lundgren : it can be delayed in pre - menopausal women , for example .
Sleep can also delay it .
Eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia can "" significantly "" delay it , as can some medications such as anti - depressants and slimming drugs .
The type of food eaten also determines how long the stomach takes to empty , says Lundgren :
She insists gastric emptying is "" not an exact science "" .
Lundgren is delivering â€ “ in a very clear , calm way â€ “ quite technical details about the way the stomach deals with solid foods :
In normal individuals , 10 % of a low - fat meal will remain in the stomach after four hours.ï » ¿ The consensus among anaesthetists is a minimum of six hours to ensure the stomach is empty after solid foods .
Defence counsel Barry Roux is going through Lundgren 's expertise , particularly in the area of gastric emptying .
She says her specialisation in anaesthesia means she needs to understand how food is digested .
This is day 28 of the trial .
The first witness is anaesthetist Professor Christina Lundgren , who is expected to testify about the contents of Steenkamp 's stomach and when she last ate ( gastric emptying ) .
Lundgren will not be televised .
The defence will call more witnesses today .
So far this week , the court has heard testimony from three neighbours and from two other residents of the Silverwoods estate , Johan Stander and Carice Viljoen , who were first on the scene after the shooting .
None of these witnesses were called by the state , despite having been interviewed by the prosecution ahead of the trial .
Nor , intriguingly , it emerged this week , will Pistorius ' housekeeper , Frank Chiziweni , give evidence , despite being asleep in the house at the time , making him the only person there other than Pistorius and Steenkamp .
We do n't know yet who will take the stand this morning , but there is some informed speculation from reporters at court : On the issue of "" gastric emptying "" , Professor Gert Saayman , who was responsible for the post - mortem on Steenkamp , gave evidence for the prosecution earlier in the trial : ï»¿Saayman â€ ¦ gave his opinion on how long before she died Steenkamp last ate by the food contents in her stomach .
He estimated that it would not have been more than two hours before she died .
That appeared to contradict Pistorius 's version that suggests the couple had eaten and were in bed by 10 pm .
Steenkamp was shot after 3 am .
Pistorius , when giving his testimony , insisted the couple had not eaten so late , adding : "" I do n't have an explanation for it . ""
After a break on Wednesday for voting in the South African general election , the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp resumes today .
Pistorius denies murder , claiming that when he shot Steenkamp dead at his home in the early hours of 14 February 2013 , he believed he was confronting an intruder .
Tuesday 's proceedings were overshadowed by claims by a friend of Steenkamp , Kim Myers , that Pistorius had acted in an intimidating manner to her during a break in the court hearing .
Myers said the athlete had muttered to her : "" How can you sleep at night ?
"" Pistorius denied speaking to her .
Brian Webber , a member of his legal team , said : "" It 's grossly untrue .
I 'm not even going to dignify that with a comment .
He never said anything of the sort . ""
Earlier on Tuesday , the court had heard from three of the athlete 's closest neighbours : Michael Nhlengethwa and Eontle Nhlengethwa , who live next door to the athlete ; and Rika Motshuane , whose house is behind Pistorius ' property .
â€¢
All three said they had heard a man crying on the night Steenkamp was shot .
The defence claims that prosecution witnesses who previously told the court they heard a woman 's scream had in fact heard Pistorius , who apparently screams like a woman when distressed .
Michael Nhlengethwa said the man 's cry was "" very high "" .
None of the witnesses heard a woman screaming .
â€¢ The two female witnesses were asked to replicate the cry they heard that night .
Each made a high - pitched , anguished scream .
â€¢ Defence counsel Barry Roux has told the judge , despite the frequent adjournments and early finishes , that he believes the defence could conclude its case by next Tuesday .
My colleague David Smith has been covering proceedings from the high court in Pretoria .
You can read his account of Tuesday 's developments here and follow his tweets here ."
2014-05-09,"There was just one witness today , defence ballistics expert Tom Wolmarans , and his rather testy cross - examination by prosecutor Gerrie Nel is not over yet .
Nel set out to take apart the defence case , supported by Wolmarans , that Reeva Steenkamp was close behind the toilet door when the first two shots were fired by Oscar Pistorius , then sustained a head wound from another shot while she was falling backward on to a wooden magazine rack .
â€¢ Wolmarans testified that he believes Steenkamp was standing close behind the toilet door when the first two bullets hit her hip and arm .
He concludes she was falling as she was hit by a subsequent bullet that caused her head wound .
â€¢ Wolmarans said an injury to Steenkamp 's back was not caused by a ricochet bullet , as the state argues , but occurred when she fell backwards on to a wooden magazine rack .
The ricochet bullet ended up in the toilet bowl , Wolmarans says : the state 's version "" does n't make sense "" .
There would have been enough energy in the bullet for it to rebound and fall into the toilet , but not enough energy to inflict injury .
But Nel said that for Steenkamp to have fallen on to the rack , given she was found with her head slumped over the toilet , she would have had to have got up .
Wolmarans says if she was falling as the last shot was fired , she could have been seated on the floor .
â€¢ Nel said striation marks on Steenkamp 's back matched the bullet fragment found in the toilet bowl .
"" I ca n't see the resemblance , "" was Wolmarans ' response .
â€¢ Wolmarans said Pistorius could be wrong in his recollection of where the magazine rack was situated .
â€¢ Nel noted that Wolmarans ' completed report is dated 23 April 2014 , after all earlier forensics witnesses had been questioned and cross - examined in court .
Nel returned on several occasions to Wolmarans ' apparent lack of record - keeping .
â€¢ Wolmarans admitted going for a beer with defence witness Dixon after the latter finished his testimony but said he would not have altered his own report on Dixon 's advice because he was not a ballistics expert .
ï»¿â€¢
After decibel tests to ascertain whether a cricket bat striking the door could be mistaken for gunshots , Wolmarans concluded the sounds of the cricket bat and gunshots were very similar , with the bat not quite as loud .
The sound tests took place at the house of Arnold Pistorius , the athlete 's uncle , and Oscar Pistorius wielded the bat .
But this evidence was undermined by Wolmarans ' repeated insistence that he was not a sound expert and references to his hearing loss and tinnitus .
Nel queried why background noise on the bat recording is much louder than on that for the gunshots ( could the first have been amplified ? ) .
â€¢ Nel queried Wolmarans ' assertion that the bullets used to shoot Steenkamp were not Black Talons , as had been previously reported , but ranger bullets , which have a similar "" mushroom "" effect on flesh .
Captain Mangena , the state ballistic expert , maintains the bullets were Black Talons .
Pistorius did not dispute this when he gave his evidence .
The court will resume on Monday morning .
Nel tells the judge : "" It 's been a long day for me . ""
Wolmarans might well agree .
He will be back on the stand on Monday morning for further cross - examination .
I will post a summary of today 's evidence shortly .
And Nel swings back to the magazine rack issue ( chop - and - change questioning is clearly his chosen technique today ) .
If Steenkamp fell on to the magazine rack , causing the mark on her back , but was found with her head slumped over the toilet , she would have had to have got up , Nel says .
Wolmarans says she was falling as the last shot was fired , then could have been seated on the floor .
And with that , Nel asks if the court can adjourn until Monday morning .
The judge agrees .
Nel switches immediately to the tests Wolmarans did on the firing range ( it seems likely the court will hear about the ricochet bullet again ) .
On the first decibel test , the firearm they were using did not function properly .
The ammunition was "" not friendly "" , says Wolmarans , but he knows this type does work with the gun Pistorius used .
The witness agrees with Nel that it is possible there was not enough propellent powder in the cartridge to make the gun cycle .
We return â€ “ again
â€ “ to the ricochet bullet .
It 's possible it could have hit Steenkamp 's back and ended up in the toilet bowl , says Nel ; it 's such a small room .
If she was sitting on the magazine rack , leaning forward towards the toilet , the bullet could have hit her in the back ?
Wolmarans said if that was so , the bullet would not have ended up in the toilet bowl .
Nel suggests that the splinters on Steenkamp 's arm were spread fairly wide ; she could have been further from the door when she was shot than the defence ( and Wolmarans ) claim .
Wolmarans :
My evidence is that there 's splinters on the arm .
She must have been in the vicinity of the door
â€
¦
It 's all speculation what happened behind that door.ï » ¿
We ca n't say for sure .
Nel is asking Wolmarans about the witness boards he showed the court on Thursday to demonstrate the dispersement of wood splinters .
Why did he use such thick board , asks Nel ?
Would n't paper have been better , as it would tear like skin ?
I was not aiming to show how splinters would react on skin , Wolmarans says , but to show dispersement .
Why did Wolmarans not ask Pistorius what ammunition he used , Nel wonders .
The court heard from Wolmarans yesterday that the bullets used to shoot Steenkamp were not Black Talons , as had been previously reported , but ranger bullets , which have a similar "" mushroom "" effect on flesh .
Nel says Mangena maintains the bullets were Black Talons .
He points out that Pistorius did not dispute that the bullets were Black Talons when he gave his evidence .
Wolmarans says he will concede the point if Mangena can show him a letter from Winchester , the manufacturer of the Black Talon bullets .
Back to the computer again â€ “ does Wolmarans have notes and photos filed on his computer , asks Nel .
What about reports ?
The witness is getting exasperated now ; he says he has answered this : he wrote notes for defence then compiled his report .
There is only one report .
Nel swings back to the bullet holes , the door and the deflection issue .
What angle of deflection would you need to match bullet hole A , C or D to ricochet mark E , he asks ?
Wolmarans ca n't say .
Nel says that when one listens to the recording of the bat sound , you hear a clear background of crickets ( the insects ) .
On the gunshots recording , the crickets are much softer , he adds .
Is he implying that the cricket bat sound test was amplified ?
Wolmarans reminds the court he is hard of hearing and has tinnitus , but "" to me , they [ the cricket bat and gunshots ] sound very similar "" .
He listened to them without his hearing aids in , he says .
We move on to the sound tests carried out on the cricket bat and gunshots .
Wolmarans repeats : he is not a sound expert , he would not know how to interpret a report on decibel tests .
Nel ascertains that Wolmarans has a file containing Mangena 's report .
Are your own old reports in there also , he asks ( Nel is keen to make this point about Wolmarans ' apparent lack of record - keeping ) .
No , they are not .
Nel thinks it strange that Wolmarans keeps copies of other reports and not his own .
Wolmarans talks through another test he performed with the laser , trying to match up marks and bullet holes .
Do you have a report of that test , Nel asks .
No , says Wolmarans .
Nel says Mangena was able to shine the laser direct through bullet hole B to ricochet mark E. Wolmarans says he can not replicate that :
The laser breaks up .
I say there 's distortion through the hole [ in the door ] .
It 's not as clear , it 's not into the centre of the bullet hole .
Nel refers to a photo of a probe placed in Steenkamp 's hip wound by Professor Gert Saayman , the state pathologist , during the autopsy .
Based on the photograph , Wolmarans in his report concluded that the trajectory was upwards .
Nel wonders why he did not consult with Dr Reggie Perumal , the defence pathologist , who was present at the autopsy ( Wolmarans was not there ) .
The witness says he never got the opportunity to ask him .
( Dr Perumal has not been called by the defence to give evidence . )
Nel and Wolmarans are really in dispute now .
Wolmarans is telling Nel he is wrong : How could he have fired upwards , when the trajectory is downwards , says Nel , disbelievingly .
Wolmarans blames the wood â€ “ "" it 's a possibility it might have deflected â€ ¦ if it 's at a angle , fired through layers of wood , it is possible "" .
Nel :
I say that 's wrong .
But let 's just carry on.ï
» ¿ We are back to the lasers , the bullet holes and the possibility of deflection .
Is Wolmarans saying Captain Mangena was wrong , asks Nel ?
Wolmarans replies : My version was that the deflection was never taken into consideration .
But the two experts agree on bullet A hitting Steenkamp 's hip
â€ “ why does Wolmarans then diverge from Mangena 's findings on bullet B causing the ricochet mark ?
The witness says bullet hole B is the only one he can link to the arm wound .
( The state 's case is that bullet B missed Steenkamp and hit the wall , causing the ricochet .
Wolmarans believes bullet B was the one that hit her arm , and that it was bullet C or D that missed her . )
Pistorius said in his testimony that he switched off the safety and opened fire .
Wolmarans says the gun might be in "" cock and lock "" position ( if not cocked , the trigger must be pulled harder for it to fire ) .
Nel :
To fire four shots , you must pull the trigger four times .
Wolmarans :
That 's correct.ï » ¿ Nel continues his cross - examination of Wolmarans .
He goes straight in on the firearm used by Pistorius to shoot Steenkamp .
Did Wolmarans establish whether the gun was cocked before Pistorius went into the bathroom ?
He did not .
The court has continued to hear evidence from Tom Wolmarans , a ballistics expert for the defence .
Barry Roux concluded questions for the defence , giving way to an aggressive cross - examination by Gerrie Nel .
â€¢ Wolmarans testified that he believes Steenkamp was standing close behind the toilet door when the first two bullets hit her hip and arm .
He concludes she was falling as she was hit by a subsequent bullet that caused her head wound .
â€¢ Wolmarans said an injury to Steenkamp 's back was not caused by a ricochet bullet , as the state argues , but occurred when she fell backwards on to a wooden magazine rack ( this tallies with the evidence of an earlier defence witness , Roger Dixon ) .
The ricochet bullet ended up in the toilet bowl , Wolmarans says : the state 's version "" does n't make sense "" .
There would have been enough energy in the ricocheted bullet for it to rebound and fall into the toilet , but not enough energy to inflict injury .
â€¢
But Nel said striation marks on Steenkamp 's back matched the bullet fragment found in the toilet bowl .
"" I ca n't see the resemblance , "" was Wolmarans ' response .
â€¢
The reconstructed toilet cubicle again came into play in court .
Wolmarans stepped inside to show his version of where Steenkamp had been and how she had fallen .
Nel disputed his account , saying there would not have been room for Steenkamp to have moved in the way he alleges .
â€¢ Wolmarans said Pistorius could be wrong in his recollection of where the magazine rack was situated .
â€¢ Nel noted that Wolmarans ' report is dated 23 April 2014 ( surprisingly not that long ago ) .
Nel says this was after Roger Dixon gave his testimony for the defence .
Wolmarans says his report was ongoing and was amended as he went along .
He was delivering verbal reports to the defence team along the way , he adds .
Nel seems concerned that Wolmarans ' report was only completed after all earlier forensics witnesses had been questioned and cross - examined in court .
â€¢ Wolmarans admitted going for a beer with defence witness Dixon after the latter finished his testimony but said he would not have altered his own report on Dixon 's advice because he was not a ballistics expert .
Nel :
So we should discard anything he said about ballistics ?
â€
¦
You would not want the court to accept anything he said , because he is not a ballistics expert ?
ï»¿â€¢
After state witnesses testified that they had heard two sets of gunshots , Wolmarans was asked to carry out sound tests to ascertain whether the second set was in fact the sound of the cricket bat striking the door .
He concluded the sounds of the cricket bat and gunshots were very similar , with the bat not quite as loud .
The sound tests took place at the house of Arnold Pistorius , the athlete 's uncle , and Oscar Pistorius wielded the bat .
â€¢ June Steenkamp left court during some of the testimony about the wounds to her daughter .
The court will resume after lunch , with Wolmarans still on the witness stand .
That was an intense session of questioning , without the frequent tea and other breaks we 've grown used to .
The court has now risen for lunch .
I will post a summary of the morning 's evidence shortly .
Nel :
You can see this core hit there and caused the bruise .
Wolmarans :
Really , I ca n't see the resemblance .
I ca n't see it .
The court is being shown a close - up photograph of the bullet core recovered from the toilet bowl by Wolmarans , and an image of Steenkamp 's back injury .
Nel requests they be shown together on the court screens .
Nel points to striation marks on Steenkamp 's back .
He says they are "" an exact replica "" of the bullet core Wolmarans found .
Wolmarans : "" I disagree totally . ""
Now Wolmarans says he ca n't exclude the possibility that Steenkamp 's arm wound â€ “ not that to her head â€ “ was the source of the blood and tissue spatter around the toilet bowl .
Nel is disbelieving .
The prosecutor turns to the injury on Steenkamp 's back .
The state says it was caused by a ricochet bullet .
The defence â€ “ and Wolmarans â€
“ claim it was the result of her falling on to the magazine rack .
The wound on her back has straight edges , says Wolmarans : it does n't fit with the jagged shape of the bullet fragment .
There would have been enough energy in the ricocheted bullet for it to rebound and fall into the toilet , says Wolmarans , but not enough energy to inflict an injury on Steenkamp .
Nel says Steenkamp 's head would have bled into the toilet and the arm would have bled to the right - hand side .
The state says the presence of blood and tissue in the toilet means her head was "" in the vicinity of "" the toilet lid , which was open , when the last shot was inflicted .
Wolmarans says the magazine rack was next to the toilet .
Nel interjects : "" Thatâ€ ™ s not the accused 's version .
Is he wrong ? ""
Wolmarans says yes , Pistorius might be wrong .
Nel wonders why Wolmarans has concluded the shots were fired in quick succession ( this is a central defence claim ) .
The witness ' version of events works only if Pistorius fired four shots very rapidly , if Steenkamp was falling as the final shot hit her .
Nel :
But on your version , she would have collapsed there , and the head wound could never have happened .
If she 'd fallen backwards , only one shot could still hit her .
Wolmarans :
I do n't say this is what happened
but this is a possibility
â€ ¦ while she was still falling down , facing the door
, another shot hit her .
Wolmarans is fighting back under difficult questioning from Nel : What happened behind that door
we will never know â€ ¦
The things that we know are four shots through the door
â€
¦
Four cartridges were recovered at the alleged crime sceneï » ¿
â€
¦ I retrieved a bullet from the toilet bowl with a piece of tile .
That tells me one thing : the deceased was not sitting on the toilet when the shot was fired .
These are things we can infer .
Then we 've got the splinters , the indication she was near to the toilet door when shots were fired .
That 's what we 've got to build our story around .
I can tell this and another expert can come along tomorrow and have another opinion .
Nel says Wolmarans ' version of where Steenkamp stood and how she fell can not be right .
She can not have been as close to the door as Wolmarans claims .
The witness says he does not understand .
Nel :
If you align hole B with the wounds on her arm , her head would be through the wall .
Thereâ€ ™ s no space .
Wolmarans :
The [ wood ] splinters are around that wound â€
¦
It is consistent with her arm being proximate to the door .
They turn to the order of shots that killed Steenkamp and the question of how she fell .
Wolmarans steps into the reconstructed cubicle to demonstrate his version but points out he is "" much taller than the deceased "" ; he has also had a back operation that means he is unable to bend in the way he would like to show .
There is laughter in court as Wolmarans ' muffled voice is heard through the closed door .
( June Steenkamp , Reeva Steenkamp 's mother , is not in court at the moment . )
Having agreed on the position of Pistorius , Nel says the bullet holes â€ “ and the lasers in court today â€ “ suggest the athlete was moving as he fired .
Wolmarans says all the shots could have been fired from one spot .
Pistorius could move his hand or his wrist , he says .
But Nel pushes the point : if the laser trajectory travels through bullet hole B to marks inside the cubicle , do the other holes match up ?
Nel moves on .
We are now concerned with where Pistorius was standing when he fired the shots .
Wolmarans says he agreed with Mangena 's conclusions on the athlete 's distance from the door and that he was on his stumps .
These links might shed some light on the case(s ) in which Nel alleged Wolmarans ' evidence had been rejected : This appears to be the Beetge case that Nel cited :
Did Wolmarans talk to Pistorius about what happened , ask Nel : The witness says he showed Pistorius a photo of Steenkamp during the time he spent with him ; the athlete left the room and vomited , he says .
Nel is unhappy about this â€ “ it is biased , he alleges :
Nel :
You just wanted to say he vomited.ï » ¿ Wolmarans : I 'm not biased .
I have never lied in a court .
Nel is gleeful .
A court has never rejected your evidence ?
He cites the Beetge case ( I will try to find out what this refers to , presumably an earlier trial in which Wolmarans gave evidence ) .
Wolmarans says he went for a beer with defence witness Roger Dixon , after his cross - examination finished .
( Dixon was accused by Nel of being an "" irresponsible "" witness after he admitted he was not trained in ballistics , light , sound or blood spatter evidence and was not present at Reeva Steenkamp 's postmortem . )
Wolmarans says he ca n't remember what he changed in his report after Dixon 's evidence , but it would not have been anything material .
Would he have taken Dixon 's advice , asks Nel :
Wolmarans :
I would n't take his advice , he 's not a ballistics expert .
Nel :
So we should discard anything he said about ballistics ?
â€
¦
You would not want the court to accept anything he said , because he is not a ballistics expert ?
The first test with the cricket bat and the gun was 21 March 2014 , Wolmarans says .
Pistorius ' trial began on 3 March 2014 .
The sound tests took place at the house of Arnold Pistorius , the athlete 's uncle .
Wolmarans was present but says he is not a sound expert ; he did not carry out the tests .
Arnold Pistorius was there "" at times "" .
Nel : Who hit the door with the bat ?
Wolmarans :
The accused himself.ï » ¿ Nel is pressing the witness hard on the details of his notes and record - keeping , and Wolmarans is wobbly : he "" ca n't remember "" in most cases .
But he insists : Never ever was I asked to alter my report to suit the defence case.ï » ¿ Nel wants to know about Wolmarans ' notes and filing system .
He keeps notes on his computer at home , the witness says ; he does n't have them with him .
He does n't know how the court could see the earlier report he gave to the defence before the trial .
He can not remember if he printed it out .
Nel asks , incredulous , if the defence had no report from Wolmarans before the trial started .
There was something , Wolmarans says ; he does n't have it with him .
He says his English in it was not good ( he is an Afrikaans speaker ) and it needed to be changed .
Nel wonders why the earlier report was not brought to court so any differences between that and the 23 April report could be compared .
Wolmarans :
Things are coming in , things change .
It 's like building a puzzle
â€ ¦ ï»¿Some of the stuff has changed .
Nel :
See , that 's what I 'm interested in and what the court should know : how your views have changed .
The cross - examination of Wolmarans begins .
Nel asks if he was in court during state evidence ; he was for some , he says .
Nel notes that Wolmarans ' report is dated 23 April 2014 ( surprisingly not that long ago ) .
Nel says this was after Roger Dixon gave his testimony for the defence .
Wolmarans says his report was ongoing and was amended as he went along .
He was delivering verbal reports to the defence team along the way , he adds .
Nel seems concerned that Wolmarans ' report was only completed after all earlier forensics witnesses had been questioned and cross - examined in court .
Judge Masipa is walking around the reconstructed toilet cubicle , seeing what the laser suggests would have been the trajectory of the four bullets .
She now returns to the bench .
Wolmarans is about to face his cross - examination by Nel .
Nel begins by asking the judge and her assessors to come closer to take a look at the reconstructed toilet room , which has been set up with probes and lasers during the adjournment .
The spray is to make the lasers more visible .
The probes and lasers have been set up to show the trajectory of bullets through the door .
Reporters in court say Mangena and his ballistics team are setting up probes and lasers around the reconstructed toilet room in court .
Roux has finished .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel asks for a break to rearrange exhibits "" to make cross - examination easier "" .
The state might well make something of the fact that Wolmarans admitted , on taking the stand , that he is somewhat hard of hearing .
He also has persistent tinnitus .
We move on to the issue of whether the sound of the cricket bat breaking down the door could have been mistaken by neighbours for the sound of gunshots .
Wolmarans agrees that the bat was used to strike the door after the bullets had been fired through it .
He lists who was present at each of the tests and the firearms and audio equipment that was used .
Although I am not a sound expert â€ ¦ as a ballistics expert , the sound made by the cricket bat hitting the door resembled the sound made by the firearm , but not as loud.ï » ¿
Wolmarans says he had constant ringing in his ears "" due to a lot of shooting "" â€ “ Pistorius has claimed he heard nothing during and immediately after the shooting because of ringing in his ears .
Wolmarans says wood splinter evidence suggests Steenkamp must have been close â€ “ between 6 cm and 20 cm â€ “ to the door when she received the injuries to her arm and hip .
The injuries to her head and the webbing of her finger happened when she was further away
â€ “ more than 20 cm .
She was falling at this time , not huddled as the state claims .
I agree with Captain Mangena that the accused was on his stumps when four shots were fired at the door .
Wolmarans reads from his report about the wound on Steenkamp 's back : "" the only reasonable manner "" the injury to the back could have been causedï » ¿ is by falling on to the magazine rack , he concludes .
Mangena 's testimony that Steenkamp was sitting on the rack "" makes no sense
â€ ¦ it would be too angled , it does n't align "" .
Wolmarans says the bullet that ricocheted off the wall would not have had the energy to injure Steenkamp 's back .
After the bullet hit the tiled wall , most of the energy would be lost .
It then rebounded and fell into the toilet bowl , along with a piece of tile .
It is not possible for the bullet to hit Steenkamp 's back and then end up in the toilet bowl , Wolmarans says : "" It does n't make sense to me . ""
Captain Mangena , who carried out the ballistics analysis for the state , is in court today , sitting close to prosecutor Gerrie Nel .
Wolmarans points out that on most issues he and Mangena are in agreement ; the key divergence is the issue of the ricochet bullet , which the state said had rebounded , causing an injury to Steenkamp 's back ; and Wolmarans says actually ended up in the toilet bowl .
A lot of detail now from Wolmarans on the bullet and jacket fragments found at the scene and how he worked to piece them together to work out which fragments came from which bullet .
Wolmarans says the bullet that hit Steenkamp 's hip did not exit her body .
Part of the bullet that caused her head wound is unaccounted for and could be any of these fragments .
Wolmarans disagrees with Mangena 's evidence for the state that the injury to Steenkamp 's back was caused by a ricochet bullet .
He says the contusions on her back are consistent with her falling against "" a hard blunt surface "" ( an earlier defence witness , Roger Dixon , said he believed she had fallen against a wooden magazine rack ) .
Wolmarans now turns to the wound to the webbing between the fingers of Steenkamp 's left hand .
He says her hand was not on her head when she received that injury : If Steenkamp 's hand had been on her head , Wolmarans says he would have expected secondary wounds from the fragmented bullet , as well as evidence of brain tissue .
Wolmarans moves on to bullets C and D , which caused Steenkamp 's head wounds .
He says his conclusion is that she was not in a standing position when she received the head wounds â€ “ he says evidence suggests she had fallen down to the right of the toilet bowl .
The lack of abrasions to her face suggests she was further than 20 cm from the door when these bullets hit her , he says .
Wolmarans is talking about bullet B.
The state expert Captain Mangena said this bullet missed Steenkamp and hit the back wall of the toilet .
Wolmarans says he believes this bullet in fact caused the wound on Steenkamp 's right arm .
Ballistics expert Tom Wolmarans is back in the witness box answering questions from defence counsel Barry Roux .
There are reports from South Africa that Pistorius has this week sold the house in which Reeva Steenkamp was killed : The report from Beeld is here ( in Afrikaans ) .
One of Pistorius ' lawyers told reporters earlier in the trial that the athlete would need to sell his house to pay his legal fees .
Brian Webber said Pistorius had not returned to the house since the night of 14 February 2013 , when Steenkamp was killed , and would not live there again .
My colleague David Smith is covering the trial from Pretoria .
You can read his report on yesterday 's developments here and follow his tweets here .
Thursday 's live blog is here .
The high court in Pretoria resumes this morning to hear the continuing testimony of Thomas ' Wollie ' Wolmarans , a forensics and ballistics expert who is giving evidence for the defence .
â€¢
On Thursday , Wolmarans said testimony from state witnesses about the bullet holes and wounds had failed to take into account deflections from the wood and curve of the toilet door .
Tests he carried out on wood splintering indicate Steenkamp was very close behind the door when she was shot , he said .
â€¢ Wolmarans also told the court that the ammunition used to shoot Steenkamp was not Black Talon bullets , as previously heard , but ranger bullets .
The "" mushroom "" effect on flesh is the same , he says .
The ballistics expert also told the court he had been unable to obtain the exact same bullets to perform later tests , as they are considered a "" collectors ' item "" .
â€¢
The court on Thursday also heard from anaesthetist Professor Christina Lundgren and social worker and probation officer Yvette Van Schalkwyk .
â€¢ Yvette Van Schalkwyk was a late addition to the witness list , coming forward only on Tuesday in response to allegations that Pistorius was "" putting on a show "" with his emotional outbursts in court .
The social worker was assigned to support Pistorius from his earliest court appearances .
What I saw from the first time I saw him was a man who was heartbroken â€ ¦
He cried , he was in mourning , he suffered emotionally .
He was very sorry for the loss , especially for the parents , what they were going through.ï » ¿ â€¢
But prosecutor Gerrie Nel queried Van Schalkwyk 's claim that Pistorius had said sorry , arguing he was sorry only for himself , and not for what he had done .
â€¢ Lundgren cast doubt on the state 's claims that Reeva Steenkamp must have eaten no more than two hours before her death , claiming that gastric emptying was "" not an exact science "" .
She described the post - mortem report that concluded Steenkamp had eaten at 1 am or later as "" purely speculative "" .
There were several reasons â€“including the type of food eaten , and the fact Steenkamp had done yoga before going to sleep â€ “ why gastric emptying could be delayed , she said .
The defence says Steenkamp ate around 7 pm , and she and Pistorius went to sleep at 10 pm ."
2014-05-12,
2014-05-12,"It has been an unexpectedly dramatic day in the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp , with the defence team apparently wrongfooted by the prosecution , which has announced that it intends to ask that Pistorius undergo a mental health assessment at a state hospital .
• Barry Roux , Pistorius ' lead lawyer , said the defence would oppose the application – to be made under section 78 of the Criminal Procedure Act – and said the athlete 's diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder did not mean he was incapable of distinguishing right from wrong .
•
The surprising move came after defence witness and forensic psychiatrist Dr Merryll Vorster said Pistorius suffered from generalised anxiety disorder at the time of the shooting , and a depressive disorder following it .
The anxiety disorder could make Pistorius a danger to society , she said .
•
The anxiety disorder stemmed from surgery at the age of 11 months to remove his lower legs , Vorster concluded , adding that a pre - verbal infant would view the operation as a "" traumatic assault "" .
•
His physical vulnerability as an adult made him more anxious , said Vorster : he could easily be pushed over on his stumps .
Since childhood , Pistorius was encouraged not to see himself as disabled , which meant he was unable to access the emotional support he needed , Vorster said .
•
His anxiety disorder left him "" hypervigilant "" about his personal safety ; he slept with his bedroom door locked and worried about his siblings ' safety when he was training overseas .
His mother , who died when Pistorius was 14 , slept with a firearm under her pillow and had an irrational fear of intruders .
•
Earlier , defence ballistics expert Thomas Wolmarans concluded his evidence , refusing to concede to the state 's argument that Reeva Steenkamp was hit in the back by a ricochet bullet .
The court will resume on Tuesday morning .
Vorster is expected to be back on the stand for more questions from both state and defence .
You can read a report of today 's developments here .
Nel wants to make an application for Pistorius to be observed and assessed under section 78 of the Criminal Procedure Act .
I 've found a copy of it here ( pdf ) .
Here is an extract from the relevant section , titled "" Mental illness or mental defect and criminal responsibility "" : ﻿(1 )
A person who commits an act or makes an omission which constitutes an offence and who at the time of such commission or omission suffers from a mental illness or mental defect which makes him or her incapable- ( a ) of appreciating the wrongfulness of his or her act or omission ; or ( b ) of acting in accordance with an appreciation of the wrongfulness of his or her act or omission , shall not be criminally responsible for such act or omission .
( 2 ) If it is alleged at criminal proceedings that the accused is by reason of mental illness or mental defect or for any other reason not criminally responsible for the offence charged … the court shall in the case of an allegation or appearance of mental illness or mental defect , and may , in any other case , direct that the matter be enquired into and be reported on .
This is a key point , but presumably one that Nel is seeking to disprove ( not that the defence has made a case for diminished responsibility ) : ( 7 ) If the court finds that the accused at the time of the commission of the act in question was criminally responsible for the act but that his capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of the act or to act in accordance with an appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act was diminished by reason of mental illness or mental defect , the court may take the fact of such diminished responsibility into account when sentencing the accused .
Nel says he would need time to prepare for his further cross - examination of Vorster .
He asks for the court to break for the day .
Vorster says she can come back tomorrow .
Court finishes for the day and will resume on Tuesday morning .
The issue of the application for Pistorius ' mental health to be assessed is not going to be resolved today .
Nel has indicated that he will persist with it .
I will post a summary of the day 's evidence shortly .
My colleague David Smith is at the high court in Pretoria ; you can follow his tweets here .
What is the problem with finishing with the witness , Judge Masipa asks Nel .
He says he needs to know if the court will refer Pistorius for observation first .
If it does , he has no further questions for her .
If it does not , he does have questions .
Nel seems fed up .
Roux can re - examine , he says ; he will ask no more questions .
Are you sure , asks the judge .
No , I 'm not sure , Nel says .
He asks for more time to consider .
The court adjourns for a break .
Roux is speaking forcefully : the witness is not saying Pistorius did not appreciate wrongfulness .
This whole report … does not make any reference to what the state now submits to you .
Nel says Roux wants to change the view of his own witness .
The generalised anxiety disorder was present at the time of the incident , he says .
Is there a mental illness that may have impacted on his ability to act in accordance with his understanding of right and wrong …
﻿
She 's answered it already .
Nel says he would not have a problem if Roux wants to re - examine now and he will make his application afterwards .
Roux points out that Nel has not actually finished his cross - examination .
We ca n't go round and round , he says .
Roux is arguing against the application .
Pistorius was not delusional , he says .
He did not imagine someone in the bathroom .
He says the judge should not hear the application without first giving him the opportunity to re - examine Vorster to show the defence 's position does not warrant the referral that Nel has requested .
He wants to question the witness further to add more context .
Then , if Nel believes there is merit in the application , he can bring it , Roux says .
Vorster says she did not have access to Pistorius ' bail application , or information in the media .
She does n't have an opinion on what Nel says is the accused 's "" more than one version "" of events .
Nel asks for an adjournment to address the issue of the referral .
Roux is not happy : you ca n't deny me the right to re - examine the witness , he says .
The judge excuses the witness for now but says she might need to come back .
Vorster
: He often said that he felt so guilty about Ms Steenkamp 's death .
It was a recurrent theme.﻿ People with generalised anxiety disorder can have sweating , nausea and diarrhoea , says Nel .
Vorster agrees : Pistorius had the first two symptoms .
But how can these be symptoms of remorse , asks Nel ( as Vorster testified earlier ) .
She repeats : "" I did not believe that they were feigned . ""
Nel says Pistorius and Steenkamp could have escaped – had there been an intruder – through the bedroom door : "" the runaway option was there "" .
Vorster disputes this : "" He is not mobile on his stumps . ""
Vorster had talked about the fight or flight response earlier , saying someone with a generalised anxiety disorder is more likely to have a "" fight "" response .
That makes him even more of a danger , does n't it , asks Nel .
That 's not my evidence , she says .
There 's no evidence that Pistorius was suffering emotional stress following an argument , says Vorster .
He told Vorster he thought there was an intruder .
Nel : When he armed himself , he at least foresaw the possibility that he might have to shoot … just by arming himself and approaching the danger .
Vorster :
Yes , he did .
Vorster says Pistorius feels remorse for having caused the death of Reeva Steenkamp .
Nel asks if he ever said he was sorry that he killed her .
The witness says she does not remember him not saying that .
He is certainly aware that he fired the shots that caused Ms Steenkamp 's death …
He feels guilty that he caused her death.﻿ Nel will continue to question the witness but says he might need to call her back later .
He will proceed with the application later .
If it succeeds , Pistorius could be taken to a state mental health institution for up to 30 days for observation and assessment of his mental health .
Nel is relentless : on this version , the court has no other option but to refer the accused .
He makes a formal application to the judge .
Vorster :
If he was afraid there was an intruder , having a generalised anxiety disorder would have affected the way he reacted to that fear.﻿ Nel digs up a quote where Vorster said such anxiety disorders could possibly affect an individual 's capacity to tell right from wrong .
Roux is angered : that 's not the witness ' evidence , he says , accusing Nel of twisting her words .
Nel will rephrase .
He goes back to Vorster , who is still on the stand .
Nel : the diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder ,
may it have an effect on his capacity to distinguish right from wrong .
Vorster :
No …
He certainly was able to tell right from wrong .
But it may be that his ability to act on that was affected by his generalised anxiety disorder .
Nel continues : he says Pistorius has been diagnosed with a mental illness .
Is that what the witness said , Judge Masipa asks .
( It 's not what the witness said , in fact : she specifically said she did not consider it a mental illness , but a "" psychiatric disorder "" . )
Nel is persistent : it is a mental disorder if it affects his ability to determine right from wrong .
But that 's not the evidence of this witness , says the judge .
( She 's right : see here . )
This is getting rather heated between Nel , for the state , and Roux , for the defence , over the interpretation of the Criminal Procedure Act .
Roux accuses Nel of over - simplifying the issue .
Nel fights back , saying the witness has herself said the diagnosis is relevant to the case .
Otherwise , Nel says , why was this witness brought before the court , if not to put forward evidence of "" mental defect "" ?
Nel does not accept this .
He is talking about "" diminished "" responsibility , he says ; not whether Pistorius was incapable of criminal responsibility .
( Nel 's phone rings .
He is more than embarrassed .
The judge asks him not to let it happen again . )
Nel says Vorster agreed that PTSD ( post - traumatic stress disorder ) and generalised anxiety disorder are related , and that defendants diagnosed with PTSD have previously been referred for assessment by the court .
Nel returns to the issue of whether Pistorius should be referred for observation .
Vorster says there would be no harm in that ; it would give the court another opinion .
Roux objects : that is not what the provisions say ( section 78 ) .
He reads them to the court : it relates to whether a defendant is not criminally responsible due to "" mental illness or mental defect "" .
It must make the person incapable of realising the effect of his act .
That is not the case here , Roux says .
Pistorius ' anxiety disorder is "" increasing in intensity "" , says Vorster .
Would that make him a danger to society , asks Nel , especially in possession of a firearm ?
Vorster agrees .
Vorster says the purpose of her report was "" to bring psychiatric factors to the court 's attention that might be relevant to the court "" – for determining guilt and , "" if necessary "" , for sentencing .
She says his anxiety disorder may be relevant to the circumstances of the case and Pistorius ' defence .
The interview on 2 May 2014 was Vorster 's first contact with Pistorius .
She then interviewed family members and friends , before interviewing the athlete again on 7 May.
This does seem late : the trial was well under way .
The shooting of Reeva Steenkamp took place on 14 February 2013 .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel is cross - examining forensic psychiatrist Dr Merryll Vorster .
He is asking her how much of the trial she has followed .
She has n't followed it in detail , she says .
Nel suggests that when Vorster spoke to Pistorius on 2 May and 7 May – after his testimony and cross - examination – his anxiety could have been because his case was not going well in court .
This is interesting – Pistorius last week denied trying to intimidate a friend of Steenkamp 's , Kim Myers , by asking her "" How do you sleep at night ? "" during a break in court proceedings .
The court has heard gripping – and controversial – testimony from Dr Merryll Vorster , a forensic psychiatrist , who has diagnosed Oscar Pistorius with generalised anxiety disorder .
•
The anxiety disorder stemmed from surgery at the age of 11 months to remove his lower legs , Vorster concluded , adding that a pre - verbal infant would view the operation as a "" traumatic assault "" .
•
State prosecutor Gerrie Nel said the diagnosis could amount to a mental illness and said he would seek advice on whether Pistorius ought to be referred by the court for assessment and observation .
•
Pistorius ' retching and crying was not feigned , Vorster said : he could not fake pallor .
•
As a child , Pistorius was encouraged not to see himself as disabled , which led to increased anxiety and an inability to access the emotional support he needed , Vorster said .
•
His physical vulnerability as an adult made him more anxious , Vorster reported , saying he could easily be pushed over on his stumps .
•
His parents also contributed to his anxiety , Vorster found : his mother slept with a firearm under her pillow and had an irrational fear of intruders ; his father was an absent parent ( he has not been in court throughout the trial ) and Pistorius cut ties with his father when he was 21 .
His mother 's death when he was 14 left him without an adult attachment figure .
•
His anxiety made him "" hypervigilant "" about his personal safety ; he slept with his bedroom door locked and worried about his siblings ' safety when he was training overseas .
•
But Vorster said his anxiety disorder would not have prevented Pistorius knowing right from wrong .
•
Earlier , defence ballistics expert Thomas Wolmarans concluded his evidence , refusing to concede to the state 's argument that Reeva Steenkamp was hit in the back by a ricochet bullet .
The court has now taken an early lunch break .
Nel says he wants to use the adjournment to study the provisions of Criminal Procedures Act , to see whether the prosecution might consider making a request for Pistorius to be assessed by the state : Nel says the anxiety is relevant to the circumstances of the shooting – therefore the provisions requiring the court to assess Pistorius must apply .
Vorster repeats : it is for the court to decide .
Nel requests an adjournment : he wants to look at Vorster 's report more closely and to examine the court 's provisions for referring an accused with a diagnosed mental health condition .
The judge allows him an hour .
I will post a summary of the morning 's evidence shortly .
Generalised anxiety disorder is not uncommon , says Vorster .
It does n't imply one has lost the capacity to see right from wrong .
Nel says he will come to that issue later .
But he has a hurdle to overcome first , he adds .
If you link this disorder to the incident , the court needs to refer for observation .
Are you saying anxiety disorder is not a mental disorder , he asks the witness .
Vorster
: I do n't believe an anxiety disorder limits the capacity to see right from wrong .
Nel :
But the word you 've used is that it "" may "" …
"" It may have affected his capacity . ""
Vorster : If one has a generalised anxiety disorder and one is involved in an incident … I 'm bringing to the court 's attention how he would react .
Nel says if the defence is trying to claim diminished responsibility , the court must refer him for assessment and observation of his mental condition .
Vorster says the court could consider that .
But she does not consider generalised anxiety disorder to be a mental illness ; it is a psychiatric diagnosis , she says .
He did not have a delusion about intruders entering his house .
What is your evidence for then , Nel asks , if the defence is not claiming Pistorius has a diminished responsibility .
Vorster says her evidence is to point out that his reactions on the night would have been different to that of a "" normal , able - bodied person without generalised anxiety disorder "" .
Nel asks if Pistorius ' anxiety disorder affected his ability to distinguish between right and wrong .
No , it did n't , says Vorster .
Are you saying he had diminished responsibility , Nel wonders .
Vorster says she feels the court should take into account the factors she has detailed .
It 's up to the court to decide whether those factors diminished his responsibility .
She is not saying he has a mental illness , she adds .
In my opinion Mr Pistorius ' reaction to the perceived threat [ in the early hours of 14 February ] should be considered in light of his physical disability and his anxiety disorder .
Vorster says Pistorius feels remorse at Steenkamp 's death , he feels guilty and has developed a depressive disorder as a result .
Roux has finished his questioning .
Nel takes over for cross - examination .
His fear of crime in South Africa was another symptom of his anxiety .
A boating accident in 2009 "" increased his personal sense of vulnerability "" – he feared he could lose his means of supporting himself and his independence .
Apparent threats from former friend Mark Batchelor ( he has claimed that Pistorius threatened to "" break my legs "" ) made him fearful of an "" ongoing threat "" .
Vorster says Pistorius ' mother frequently called the police and family / friends to investigate noises she had heard , even though there was no evidence of break - ins .
Pistorius ' ability to walk without his prostheses is "" poor … he could easily be pushed over "" , says Vorster .
His physical vulnerability makes him more anxious ; his anxiety makes him want to conceal his vulnerability .
Vorster diagnosed him with a generalised anxiety disorder ( meaning an anxiety disorder that is all - pervasive , not specific to , for example , flying ) and a depressive disorder , secondary to the incident –
he has become depressed since the shooting .
There is no evidence he was depressed prior to the shooting .
She dates the anxiety disorder to the age of 11 months , when he had the surgery to remove his lower legs .
Vorster says of Pistorius ' retelling of the night Steenkamp was killed : He was distressed , crying and retching .
He said he had no intention of killing Miss Steenkamp.﻿ In my opinion , they [ his reactions ] were genuine .
If one had to feign retching , one would have hoarseness , a reddening …
Mr Pistorius had a pallor and a sweating .
This can not be feigned .
Vorster says Pistorius did not share thoughts and feelings with close friends .
He was guarded and distrustful .
His stress increased as he had to attend more social and media events , says Vorster .
He had to prepare for longer in order to conceal his identity .
When he was training in Italy , her report says , he would follow news from South Africa and be very anxious about the safety of his brother and sister .
Increased levels of anxiety means you see your environment as threatening , even when it is not .
In South Africa , he worried about being followed and worried about the security of his home .
He slept with his bedroom door locked .
He woke often thinking there was a noise or a threat .
He was "" hypervigilant "" .
Dr Merryll Vorster continues reading from her report on Pistorius .
He does have a clear family history of anxiety …
his mother , sister and brother .
Vorster said he became increasingly unwilling to be seen on his stumps by anybody , including close friends and family .
He would wear prostheses all the time , removing them only when he went to bed .
He "" strove always to conceal "" his stumps .
Concealing his disability made him less able to access the emotional support he needed.﻿
Vorster says it is her view that Pistorius has an anxiety disorder :
His strict training regime and his diet helped him to manage his anxiety …
Individuals who are anxious try to bring order to their lives to try to control their anxiety .
His growing fame and media interest made it increasingly difficult for him to control his anxiety , she says .
The court adjourns for a tea
break.﻿ Vorster continues to read from her report : Pistorius broke all ties with his father at the age of 21 .
He had little contact with extended family , though was close to his sister .
He describes himself as being lonely .
He kept in touch with friends mostly via social media .
He was highly anxious about high levels of violent crime in South Africa , and bought a firearm for his protection .
Vorster says Pistorius concealed his disability as much as he could as a child .
He was sometimes teased at school about his prostheses and his brother Carl would intervene .
He lost his only adult attachment figure at the age of 14 , when his mother died suddenly : Vorster talks about the separation of Pistorius ' parents when he was six .
His father was not a responsible parent and was largely absent , and his mother was anxious , sleeping with a firearm under her pillow .
The children were reared to see their external environment as threatening …
Their mother added to their anxiety.﻿ [ That anxiety ] clearly remained .
Roux turns to Vorster 's report , in which she evaluated Pistorius ' mental condition ; she also interviewed family and friends ( including his friend Justin Divaris ; his sister , Aimee Pistorius , Carl Pistorius , his brother ; Ampie Louw , his coach ; and others ) .
Vorster talks of the early surgery to remove Pistorius ' lower legs due to a congenital deformity .
It happened at a "" pre - language stage "" , she says : This kind of experience is perceived by infants as a traumatic assault .
[ Through his childhood ] he was never able to allow himself to be seen as being disabled .
He was always encouraged to be seen as being normal .
Over time , this could result in increasing levels of anxiety.﻿
There 's a delay as Roux asks Vorster for copies of her reports and CVs ; he did not have time to get them from her as he was doing the re - examination of Wolmarans , he apologises to the judge .
He runs through her qualifications : she has a PhD in forensic psychiatry .
Roux has no further questions for Wolmarans and he is excused .
Roux is not sure if the next witness is here .
Judge Masipa points out she has just come in .
The next witness is Dr Merryll Vorster , a specialist psychiatrist .
Wolmarans :
To hit a target , you must follow certain targets …
There was no sight alignment.﻿
Roux says the evidence from the state about Steenkamp 's back injury is that the striations are upward – how would the bullet travel upward ?
Wolmarans says it is not possible .
Barry Roux is re - examining Wolmarans .
Roux says they did a test during break getting someone to sit on the magazine rack in the reconstructed toilet cubicle .
He asks Wolmarans if Captain Mangena factored in bullet deflection during his tests for the state .
He says he did not .
Wolmarans repeats his claims that a ricochet bullet would not have had enough energy to cause the injury to Steenkamp 's back and end up in the toilet bowl where he found it .
Wolmarans left the police in 1992 , Nel confirms – he has not conducted a proficiency test since then ?
The police conduct annual tests , the prosecutor points out .
There is no need in the private sector , says Wolmarans .
Nel has finished his cross - examination .
Barry Roux , for the defence , asks for a 15-minute adjournment .
Nel is asking Wolmarans about his night visits to the crime scene .
The most recent was three or four weeks ago , during the trial , after Dixon 's evidence about visibility from the balcony .
( Dixon said the balcony light was off when he tried to recreate what the sportsman could see , even though Pistorius has acknowledged it was on . )
The defence asked Wolmarans to go back to see what he could see with the balcony light on .
Frank opened the door for him , says Wolmarans ( Frank is Frank Chiziweni , Pistorius ' housekeeper , who was asleep in the house on the night Steenkamp was killed .
He has not been called to give evidence ) .
Wolmarans says he shouted to another member of the team : "" Christo ! ""
He then closed the door and shouted again and the colleague could not hear him .
This was at the crime scene , when he went to rehang the door , but it was not an official test .
He is not a sound expert , he adds , again .
( "" Christo "" is a friend who was assisting Wolmarans as he had had an operation on his back . )
Wolmarans :
Nobody asked me to do it [ the shouting ] ,
I just did it.﻿
Nel is asking Wolmarans about his various visits to the crime scene .
He went there "" one or two times "" at the request of the family or defence team , Wolmarans says .
He found the bullet fragment on 18 February ; he also went on 8 March , with Captain Mangena .
Nel cites another handful of dates .
Nel :
Did you conduct any sound tests at the scene ?
Wolmarans : Not at the scene.﻿ But
the magazine rack was there on the scene when Wolmarans did his reconstruction , Nel insists .
Why did he not take it into account ?
Why did he put it in the wrong place ?
Because I did n't know where it was at that stage , Wolmarans replies .
But you had Captain Mangena 's report , says Nel .
Why did n't you pay attention to the detail in the report about it ?
Wolmarans says he has already answered the question and has no other answer .
He is sounding increasingly exasperated .
Wolmarans says he had only a couple of hours on the crime scene .
He would have needed a day or two , or even a week , to do a full reconstruction .
To be honest …
it 's unfair to ask me a question like that.﻿ Nel is querying Wolmarans ' reconstruction of events inside the toilet cubicle : Wolmarans says that when he visited the crime scene ( after the police had left ) , the magazine rack had been moved .
It differed from its position in photographs of the scene .
The state 's case is that bullet B missed Steenkamp .
Wolmarans says bullet B caused the wound on her arm ; he thinks bullet C or D is the one that missed .
But you were not able to match up bullet hole C with ricochet mark E using the laser , Nel asks , without meaning the gun would not line up with the other holes .
Wolmarans says you need to take into account recoil ; the gun does not always return to exactly the same position after firing .
Unfortunately we have to rehash some things from Friday , says Nel .
He returns to the possibility that bullet B missed Steenkamp ( the state says it missed her and made ricochet mark E on the wall ; the defence says it caused her arm wound ) .
She could not have fallen flat to the ground after the first bullet hit her hip , Nel and Wolmarans agree , because of the later injuries : Nel takes Wolmarans through the bullet heights ( as measured through the holes in the door ) .
She would n't be able to support her own weight , sitting on her haunches , after the bullet wound to the hip , says Nel .
Wolmarans agrees .
If she sat on the toilet , bullets C and D would not have been able to hit her , says Nel .
Again , the witness agrees .
Nel :
The only other item in that toilet at the time that would have given her height would have been the magazine rack …
So does n't that make sense , that she was sitting on the magazine rack when she received [ injuries ] C and D ?
Wolmarans :
She would not have been able to be sitting because of the injury [ to her hip ] .
Nel : If she fell back , she can not support her body weight …
but she is sitting on the magazine rack and leaning forward .
That could give her the necessary height for C and D to hit her .
That is possible .
Wolmarans :
I 'm not sure.﻿ Back to the defence reconstruction of the events of 14 February :
Another swerve by Nel –
he wants to know the details of Wolmarans ' meeting with fellow defence witness Roger Dixon after the latter finished his evidence .
Wolmarans :
I wo n't dispute it
…
we had discussions about the case .
It would be abnormal if we did n't discuss it .
Wolmarans can not remember the detail of the discussion .
He can , however , remember that he wanted pork chops but the restaurant did not have any , so they both had steak .
Nel continues his Friday tactic of leaping from topic to topic .
Now he returns to the issue of "" striations "" on Steenkamp 's back –
the state says they were caused by a ricochet bullet , the defence claims they were the result of her falling back on to a wooden magazine rack .
Wolmarans says he has great respect for pathologist Gert Botha , but adds Botha "" is n't a tool mark expert "" .
He disagrees with him on the striation marks .
On to the decibel tests in which Wolmarans ' team compared the sound of a cricket bat on the door with gunshots , to see if neighbours who testified to hearing shots could have in fact heard the bat .
Nel asks why was there such a delay between the tests – the first on 21 March , the second 9 April .
He had a busy schedule , says Wolmarans .
He reminds the court that there were problems with the firearm in the first test ( "" unfriendly "" ammunition ) .
Was the background noise an issue , asks Nel ( he pointed out on Friday that you can hear crickets in the background of the bat recording ) .
Do n't you think it would have been better to conduct both tests with the same background noise , he asks ?
Wolmarans repeats his claim from Friday : he is not a sound expert .
He does n't know .
The defence 's forensics case is that Steenkamp was close behind the toilet door when the first two shots were fired , based in part on the pattern of wood splinters on her arm .
Nel points out more splintering , further away , on the toilet cistern .
It could have been from when Pistorius broke down the door with the cricket bat , Wolmarans suggests .
Nel asks if Wolmarans also agrees with Mangena that Pistorius was on his stumps .
He does .
Nel is going back to the issue of the bullets ' trajectories and the ricochet mark ( E ) on the toilet room wall .
Wolmarans agrees with Nel that with the laser where it is , it is not possible to line up bullet holes
A , C or D with mark E.
What does Wolmarans know of the accused 's version of events , Nel wonders .
Wolmarans says he has not spoken directly to Pistorius about it , nor did the defence team tell him .
But he did read Pistorius ' bail application .
Wolmarans says he relied on the report of Captain Mangena – the state 's ballistics expert – to determine where Pistorius was standing when he fired the shots .
State prosecutor Gerrie Nel is back on his feet to cross - examine defence ballistics expert Thomas Wolmarans .
Nel strikes right away on the issue of Wolmarans ' note - taking –
this was a particular concern for Nel on Friday , too .
Wolmarans says he mostly gave verbal reports to the defence team ; he occasionally gave them written notes , but he struggles to be specific .
The murder trial of Olympic and Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius is about to get underway .
Defence ballistics expert Thomas "" Wollie "" Wolmarans is still on the stand , facing further cross - examination from prosecutor Gerrie Nel .
•
On Friday , Wolmarans testified that he believes Steenkamp was standing close behind the toilet door when the first two bullets hit her hip and arm .
He concludes she was falling as she was hit by a subsequent bullet that caused her head wound .
•
Wolmarans said an injury to Steenkamp 's back was not caused by a ricochet bullet , as the state argues , but occurred when she fell backwards on to a wooden magazine rack .
The ricochet bullet ended up in the toilet bowl , Wolmarans says : the state 's version "" does n't make sense "" .
There would have been enough energy in the bullet for it to rebound and fall into the toilet , but not enough energy to inflict injury .
But Nel said that for Steenkamp to have fallen on to the rack , given she was found with her head slumped over the toilet , she would have had to have got up .
Wolmarans says if she was falling as the last shot was fired , she could have been seated on the floor .
•
Nel said striation marks on Steenkamp 's back matched the bullet fragment found in the toilet bowl .
"" I ca n't see the resemblance , "" wasWolmarans ' response .
•
Wolmarans said Pistorius could be wrong in his recollection of where the magazine rack was situated .
•
Nel noted that Wolmarans ' completed report is dated 23 April 2014,after all earlier forensics witnesses had been questioned and cross - examined in court .
Nel returned on several occasions to Wolmarans ' apparent lack of record - keeping .
•
Wolmarans admitted going for a beer with defence witness Dixon after the latter finished his testimony but said he would not have altered his own report on Dixon 's advice because he was not a ballistics expert .
﻿•
After decibel tests to ascertain whether a cricket bat striking the door could be mistaken for gunshots , Wolmarans concluded the sounds of the cricket bat and gunshots were very similar , with the bat not quite as loud .
The sound tests took place at the house of Arnold Pistorius , the athlete 's uncle , and Oscar Pistorius wielded the bat .
But this evidence was undermined by Wolmarans ' repeated insistence that he was not a sound expert and references to his hearing loss and tinnitus .
Nel queried why background noise on the bat recording is much louder than on that for the gunshots ( could the first have been amplified ? ) .
•
Nel queried Wolmarans ' assertion that the bullets used to shoot Steenkamp were not Black Talons , as had been previously reported , but ranger bullets , which have a similar "" mushroom "" effect on flesh .
Captain Mangena , the state ballistic expert , maintains the bullets were Black Talons .
Pistorius did not dispute this when he gave his evidence ."
2014-05-13,"You can read a report of today 's developments in court here : The chief prosecutor in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius has asked for the Paralympian to be placed under psychiatric evaluation after an expert witness testified that he had an anxiety disorder .
Gerrie Nel noted that a psychiatrist for the defence had testified that the disorder she diagnosed in Pistorius may have played a role in his fatal shooting of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp at his home on Valentine 's day last year .
Nel acknowledged that an evaluation of Pistorius 's state of mind at a government facility could mean the trial , which began on 3 March , would be delayed .
Judge Thokozile Masipa ordered an adjournment and said she would rule on Nel 's request on Wednesday morning.﻿
That 's it for the live blog for today .
The blog will be back on Wednesday morning for the judge 's ruling .
A shorter day for the court , as Judge Thokozile Masipa adjourns proceedings until Wednesday morning to consider the state 's application to have Oscar Pistorius sent to a mental health hospital for 30 days for evaluation .
•
Making the application on behalf of the state , prosecutor Gerrie Nel said the court had no choice but to refer Pistorius : If there is a reasonable possibility that some mental illness or disorder played a part , the court must refer.﻿ •
But Nel said the state did not and will not make the case that Pistorius was mentally ill .
The court is obliged to "" act decisively "" because of the evidence of the defence 's own psychiatrist , Dr Merryll Vorster , who has diagnosed him with generalised anxiety disorder , which might have affected his actions on the night he shot Reeva Steenkamp .
If the court chooses not to refer , it could have a bearing on a future appeal .
•
The defence strongly opposes the application for referral .
Defence counsel Barry Roux said the prosecution move was "" a ruse "" and there were no grounds to support Nel 's allegation
that generalised anxiety disorder is a mental illness .
Neither the state nor the defence think Pistorius is mentally ill ; therefore there is no merit to the application , Roux said : The state wants a second opinion through a very strange procedure .
We can see the motive .
It 's quite clear.﻿ •
Roux angrily dismissed claims by Nel that Pistorius 's team had put forward "" three defences "" , including this most recent one of psychiatric disorder .
This is the state 's invention , he said .
•
But Nel said the defence had wanted to use the diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder as "" a fall - back option "" after Pistorius performed poorly in the witness box .
•
State and defence clashed over interpretation of case law concerning referrals , with Roux accusing the prosecution of failing to understand the cases cited .
Nel countered that he was counsel in one of them .
"" I lost . ""
•
Roux said the application was also "" premature "" , as the defence intends to call a further witness to discuss Pistorius 's "" fight or flight "" response .
The judge will make her ruling based on section 78 of the Criminal Procedure Act – you can read some background on that here .
If she rules that Pistorius must be referred , that will cause a significant delay to the trial ( as Nel acknowledged ) .
Waiting lists for inpatient treatment at state - run mental health institutions around Pretoria are reported to be several months long , although it is possible the athlete 's case would be fast - tracked .
The observation usually takes 30 days .
If Judge Masipa rejects Nel 's application , it is assumed that Roux will be asked to continue with his remaining witnesses .
Either way , Roux 's assertion last week that the defence could be wrapped up by today was well wide of the mark .
It looks as if that will be it for today – the court ca n't proceed until the judge has made her ruling on the mental health referral .
I will post a summary shortly .
Roux jumps up again .
He 's not after "" a second bite of the cherry "" , he insists : he wants to point out something in case law to the judge .
Judge Masipa says she will give her decision on Wednesday morning .
The court needs to act decisively and not wait for the appeal , Nel says .
The state has not and will not make the case that the accused is mentally ill , he says .
But the defence has introduced that , and the court has to act .
Nel :
We are not looking for this …
We are going on the diagnosis of the defence witness﻿
…
If there is a mental illness , that 's the end of it .
The judge asks Nel to clarify his grounds .
Generalised anxiety disorder is listed in the DSM , Nel says : it is a mental illness .
And this means it needs professional evaluation .
The defence argument that it needs to call another witness is "" unfortunate "" , says Nel .
It is "" holding the court to ransom "" .
﻿I would also be [ emotional ] if I called a witness and that witness opened the door for the referral of my client .
Nel is back on his feet .
He agrees with Roux that the court should not be emotional .
This might be the only thing on which he agrees with him .
He takes issue with Roux 's dismissal of the cases he presented in support of his application .
He knows one of these cases very well , Nel says : he was counsel .
He lost the case .
"" I stand by what I have argued . ""
Judge Masipa asks Roux to deal with the issue of the onus to prove Pistorius 's mental condition –
Nel said the onus was on the defence .
Roux says it is assumed that every person is assumed not to have a mental illness unless the contrary is proved .
The burden of proof is on the party that raises the issue , says Roux .
"" We do not raise it . ""
Roux :
There is a second problem – apart from the fact there is no merit [ in this application ] .
We have another witness coming .
It 's premature.﻿ The state is welcome to repeat its application after the next witness , Roux shrugs .
But there is still no merit in it .
The next witness is going to deal with Pistorius 's "" fight or flight "" response , Roux says .
Nel 's "" three defences "" claim is "" irrelevant "" , says Roux .
It shows the state 's case is weak , he says .
The defence does not argue automatism .
The "" three versions "" are the state 's invention .
An application for section 78 referral must be an allegation supported by facts , says Roux .
Vorster 's testimony does not support it .
It is not the defence case , he says .
Neither the state nor the defence argue that Pistorius is mentally ill .
The state accepts the expertise of Dr Vorster , says Roux .
But she says explicitly it is not her evidence that Pistorius should be referred .
She did not think he was unable to distinguish between right and wrong – "" and she went on to repeat it and repeat it and repeat it "" , says Roux .
Pistorius is not delusional and he is not paranoid , says Roux .
The state is wrong in saying an "" indication "" of mental illness is enough .
It is wrong in relying on these previous cases .
It is a ruse in order to get a second opinion …
It is simply going nowhere .
There must be substance in the allegation , says Roux .
He sounds angry .
He says the state is confused ( "" with respect "" ) .
He will show how the examples quoted by the state are wrong , he says .
In one case , he says , it was obvious that the accused did not know what was going on in court .
All those cases do n't support the state
…
The state wants a second opinion through a very strange procedure .
We can see the motive .
It 's quite clear.﻿ Roux does not agree with Nel 's interpretation of the case law on these applications – "" rather unfortunate "" is his verdict .
The "" mere making of such an allegation "" ( of mental illness ) is not enough to justify a referral , he says .
That would be "" absurd "" .
The test for referral is "" low "" , Nel says .
The court does not want this case to be sent back by the appeal judges because it has not considered the psychiatric diagnosis .
It falls 100 % within the definition of mental illness … ﻿It is in the interests of justice for the accused to be referred . ""
At this stage my lady , we say that certainly the court is entitled to know what the accused 's defence is . ""
Nel says the court has so far heard "" three defences "" : putative self - defence , automatonism and now a psychiatric disorder .
Vorster said Pistorius could be a danger to society and should not have had a firearm .
Nel says this is a further indication that he should be referred .
A court can not judge a mental disorder or defect , Nel says .
It needs to be professionally assessed , and not solely by the defence 's own psychiatrist , Dr Vorster .
﻿She is an expert … but the fact is , she indicated that a psychiatric diagnosis may have affected him .
Based on the evidence , Mr Roux will not argue that they are abandoning diminished responsibility .
Surely the purpose of Vorster 's evidence is for her diagnosis to be taken into account , Nel says .
The possibility of diminished responsibility , or reduced capability , is enough to refer at this stage .
It is relevant to conviction , Nel says , not just sentencing :
Nel says Pistorius "" was not the most impressive witness "" .
Perhaps this is why Vorster was called in at such a late stage , he says .
If this case ends up in the appeal court , says Nel , it might be asked why he was not referred for observation at this stage .
Nel queries the timing of Vorster 's assessment of Pistorius : it was after the trial was well under way .
Nel says the defence wanted to have the anxiety disorder "" as a fall - back position "" .
We have had several different defences in this trial , he says .
The change in defence should be a "" red light "" for the court , Nel says .
Nel : If there is a reasonable possibility that some mental illness or disorder played a part , the court must refer.﻿ He cites other cases where the possibility of a mental illness was reason enough to refer .
If there is any indication , he says , the court would have to refer the accused for observation .
It was the defence 's decision to call Dr Vorster at such a late stage , says Nel .
There had been no suggestion of psychiatric disorder earlier in the trial .
But the defence has called a witness to say GAD may have played a role on that particular day .
This is what the current application is based on , says Nel .
"" The matter does n't end here , "" says Nel :
Nel says Vorster 's "" diagnosis was directly relevant to the accused 's version and may have affected ability to act in appreciation of wrongfulness "" .
He brings the application under section 78.1 B and section 79 of the Criminal Procedure Act .
The prosecution is mindful that this will cause a delay to the trial .
Nel says he is making a formal application for Pistorius to be referred for a mental health evaluation .
He passes his papers to the judge .
Nel earlier accused Pistorius of inconsistency : he apparently told Vorster he had fired at a noise , but did not claim this in court .
Vorster says she does n't think this is significant .
Roux runs through once again the various contributing factors to Pistorius 's anxiety :
Vorster repeats : people accused of murder , or who are giving evidence in court , can be anxious .
This is not the same as generalised anxiety disorder .
Nel queried Pistorius 's failure to repair a broken window .
The replacement glass was in the house , says Roux .
He was waiting for the contractor to come and fit it .
He had asked for the ladders to be safely stowed away .
Roux talks about a situation in which Pistorius was assaulted from behind .
He had his firearm but did not use it .
Vorster says this shows he was responsible .
The fact that Pistorius used a cricket bat against the bedroom door , as well as locking it , also speaks to his anxiety , says Roux .
Here , Judge Masipa intervenes : was n't there a problem with the locking mechanism ?
Roux checks :
Pistorius said he thought the lock mechanism was not strong enough ; he used the bat as an additional security measure .
Roux :
You do n't make an allegation that he must be referred .
Vorster :
No.﻿ Vorster talks about a tendency for people with GAD to wake in the night hearing noises – this is not the same as a paranoid delusion about imaginary intruders .
That would be a case for referral , she says .
Roux says Pistorius 's testimony was that he heard the bathroom window opening and the toilet door closing .
This was not a delusion , he says .
The witness agrees .
We now turn to the section 78 issue – whether Pistorius should be referred for mental health observation .
Roux :
You were asked whether you believe that your allegation means he should be referred …
It 's not a mental illness in the terms of the Criminal Procedure Act .
Vorster :
That is my opinion , yes … While it is a psychiatric diagnosis , so are many other psychiatric diagnoses .
I have seen many hundreds , if not thousands of accused …
A diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder would not render one unfit to stand trial .
Barry Roux , for the defence , is beginning his re - examination of forensic psychiatrist Dr Merryll Vorster .
He begins with the DSM5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ) issue that Nel was concerned with .
Vorster reads from a cautionary note in the manual : GAD could have affected Pistorius not in his ability to tell right from wrong , but his ability to act in accordance with that , Nel says .
Vorster agrees .
Nel turns to the definition of GAD , as listed in the DSM ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , which classifies mental disorders ) .
It qualifies as a mental disorder , he confirms with the witness .
And that 's it from Nel .
A very short bout of questioning .
Roux asks for a further adjournment to prepare for his own re - examination of the witness .
So the court is on another break .
Gerrie Nel continues his cross - examination for the state of forensic psychiatrist Dr Merryll Vorster .
Nel says he understands Vorster 's evidence to mean that this psychiatric disorder – GAD – may have played a role in the shooting of Reeva Steenkamp , "" in his version only "" ( that is , that he fired thinking there was an intruder ) .
Vorster agrees : his psychiatric condition is a constant , but her report deals with his version of events ; she has n't applied it to other versions .
Nel has so far this morning not mentioned the threatened application to refer Pistorius to a mental health institution for 30 days to assess his mental condition .
He conceded on Monday that he would need to finish his cross - examination of Dr Vorster , and allow re - examination by Barry Roux , before he could proceed with the section 78 application .
Assuming Nel does not have many more questions for the witness when the court resumes –
he indicated he was nearly finished – and that Roux 's second round of questioning does not take the rest of the day , we should hear within the next couple of hours if the state will apply to have Pistorius referred for observation .
The defence has already made clear it will strongly oppose any move to do this .
Vorster
: I would n't expect him to remember with crystal clarity …
Nel :
But he said to you that he fired at the noise .
And he never said that to the court .
Vorster :
But that can be explained … in a fear situation , I would n't expect him to remember each and every detail .
Nel :
There is another explanation .
He could just be lying .
Vorster :
Yes , he could be lying.﻿
The court adjourns for a tea break .
Vorster says Pistorius told her he heard an intruder and fired at the noise .
It was not his testimony in court that he fired at a noise , Nel says .
There does appear to be an inconsistency , Vorster agrees .
Vorster says the GAD diagnosis would be relevant if the court found he shot at what he thought was an intruder .
If the court were to find that he deliberately shot Reeva Steenkamp , it would not be .
Vorster says Pistorius had friends "" to avoid feeling lonely …
They were not friends he could confide in . ""
His sexual relationships tended to be short , she says .
He coped socially , but this was superficial .
Would n't you expect the accused in a murder trial to be anxious when he sees a psychiatrist for evaluation , asks Nel .
Vorster agrees , but calmly maintains she is able to tell the difference between this and a generalised anxiety disorder .
The "" strange smell "" is dust .
The court turns its attention back to the evidence , and Nel is back to fear of crime in South Africa .
Why does the athlete 's fear qualify as a disorder ?
Taken with the history , you can see the symptoms of an anxiety disorder , says Vorster ; the testimony of friends , family and coach confirm that .
Vorster says had Pistorius been seen by a mental health professional in his teens , he might have had a diagnosis then .
( Nel and Vorster are distracted : there is a "" strange smell "" .
Someone is dispatched to check it out . )
If Pistorius was concealing and coping with this disorder at the age of 14 , says Nel , why would it have got worse ?
The stresses on him were increasing , says Vorster .
( His mother died when he was 14 . )
Nel :
Any child losing a mother would be traumatised by that event.﻿ Any child losing a mother would be anxious .
It 's not uncommon .
Vorster :
The importance of a primary attachment figure ca n't be underestimated [ sic ]
…
She was n't there .
Nel :
It 's not extraordinary .
It happens to lots of people .
Nel questions whether a 14-year - old Pistorius would have been able to conceal an anxiety disorder .
Of course he would , says Vorster .
He would have known he was anxious , but he did n't know he had a treatable condition .
Nel wonders why Vorster did not speak to Pistorius ' father , given that she dates his diagnosis from his early childhood .
( Vorster concluded that Pistorius ' father was an "" irresponsible and absent parent "" . )
Nel :
Why would you say that at 17 months it [ GAD ] had already started ?
Vorster
: There is no doubt that children who have bilateral amputations at the age of 11 months find that very stressful …
It 's a factor that contributed to the development of GAD .
But he did well at creche , at school , at sports , says Nel .
He was encouraged to conceal his disability , says Vorster : he was not allowed to reveal his prostheses.﻿
Vorster says people with GAD are not more violent than other people .
But , she adds : People with generalised anxiety disorders probably should n't have firearms …
That makes that person at risk of being involved in violent activities .
Unfortunately people who are anxious about their personal security are the ones who are more likely to want to purchase a firearm.﻿ Would n't the state 's version of events have affected your view that GAD played a role in the offence , Nel asks .
Vorster :
No .
It played a role at the time of the offence …
That would be the case whatever the version of events.﻿ Nel : If the court finds the accused knew the deceased was in the toilet … could GAD play a role ?
Vorster :
Yes , it could .
A person with a generalised anxiety disorder would be anxious about losing a relationship .
Vorster says that her asking Pistorius about the incident when Reeva Steenkamp was killed "" was not to come to the truth of the event "" , but to determine his mental state at the time .
Should n't you have looked at other versions of the event , asks Nel .
They move on to another report to which Vorster had access , done by a Dr Holmes , an educational and industrial psychologist .
She does n't know why this report was commissioned , but it confirmed her diagnosis and impression of Pistorius , she tells Nel .
Should the court see it , says Nel ; did it have influence on your report ?
Vorster says she does n't think so .
When you drafted the report , was the intention for it to be used for sentencing purposes , asks Nel .
If necessary , says Vorster .
Is that why it mentions the depression after the incident , and his remorse , Nel wonders .
Vorster says not : this is about his current mental state .
Nel :
What factors would then be more in line with the sentencing process ?
Vorster :
The generalised anxiety disorder and the vulnerability.﻿ Nel asks about an incident on the way back from the Vaal where Pistorius and friends were stopped by a traffic officer .
( Presumably he means this incident , in which Pistorius was said to have fired a gun through the car sunroof . )
Would n't a person with GAD have acted differently , asks Nel .
Vorster explains ( she is speaking very patiently ) :
Both passengers would be distressed at being stopped for speeding .
But the person with GAD would be more distressed .
She refers to the person with GAD as "" ill "" .
"" I like the ' ill ' , "" says Nel , with a nod to his application for Pistorius to be assessed .
Nel persists .
A person with GAD would close the balcony door .
Not necessarily , says Vorster .
People with generalised anxiety disorders have relationships , she says ; they could rely on another person to close a door .
Barry Roux , for the defence , objects to Nel 's questioning about Pistorius ' alarm system .
Nel has been talking about it not functioning properly ; Roux says there were no issues with it , though there was a problem with the outside beams .
Nel continues trying to punch holes in the defence claim that Pistorius was highly anxious about his personal security .
Why would he go to sleep with his balcony door open ?
It would depend , says Vorster – if someone else was there , their needs and comfort would also be a factor .
Nel homes in on another apparent inconsistency : there were ladders outside , "" not locked up and unsecured "" – would that not be odd for a person who has GAD ?
Vorster again concedes that she would expect a person with an anxiety disorder to be concerned about that .
Would n't you expect such an anxious person to take extra measures to secure the rest of his house , asks Nel .
Vorster agrees , but points out that estate rules preventing him adding anything else .
But there was a broken window , says Nel .
A person with GAD would fix that window immediately , would n't he ?
Vorster says she would not expect him to leave it for a long time , no .
Nel turns to Pistorius ' apparent fear of crime .
Vorster testified on Monday that the athlete was severely anxious about crime in South Africa and took "" excessive "" security measures .
In addition to the security measures on the estate , he had dogs , a burglar alarm , and would lock himself in his bedroom at night , says Vorster .
She says Pistorius had been intending to move to Johannesburg , with a double - gate entry , where he would feel safer .
Most people have burglar alarms and dogs , says Nel .
Why is this exceptional ?
Most people do n't lock themselves in their bedroom at night , says Vorster .
Nel says , in his view , that is quite common .
Is the witness showing partiality towards the accused ?
Vorster denies bias .
She thought Pistorius 's concerns about his safety were more than the average South African .
There is no evidence that Pistorius was incapacitated by his anxiety disorder , Nel asks .
Vorster says no : he was able to continue with his life , though stressed and distressed .
None of the witnesses – friends , a former girlfriend – mentioned anxiety , Nel says .
People with anxiety disorders seek to control and conceal it , says Vorster .
She says Pistorius and his family were not aware that he had this disorder .
Vorster agrees that within the diagnosis of GAD there are different levels of severity .
Nel :
If it 's severe enough and it impacts the person in a severe manner – that could be seen as a mental illness ?
Vorster
: I would n't say that .
Nel has argued that the diagnosis suggests Pistorius has a mental illness that warrants observation under section 78 ( see here for more details of that).﻿ Nel asks Vorster whether her diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder ( GAD ) would spill over into all areas of Pistorius ' life , affecting his social , family and professional life .
She agrees .
But lots of people are anxious about their work , says Nel – what makes it a "" disorder "" .
Vorster :
One needs to have it over an extended period of time …
The individual sees situations in a more serious light than they actually are , and the reaction to the anxiety is related to various symptoms … sleep disorder , nausea , sweating , diarrhoea , inability to concentrate , distractibility .
Perhaps irritability.﻿
Yes , everybody has something they worry about …
People with an anxiety disorder are unable to set their worries aside .
Judge Thokozile Masipa is in court , and state prosecutor Gerrie Nel is straight back into his questioning of defence forensic psychiatrist Dr Merryll Vorster .
Day 31 of the trial and the media presence outside the court is still there in force : The court should resume very shortly .
Last week , defence counsel Barry Roux said he thought he could wrap up the defence 's evidence by today .
It seems highly unlikely now that this will happen , with the day looking set to be dominated by the row over Pistorius ' mental health .
At issue today will be whether the prosecution is acting correctly in requesting the mental health referral for Pistorius – Barry Roux , for the defence , says it is not .
You can read more about section 78 of the Criminal Procedure Act here .
The key point is whether Pistorius : suffers from a mental illness or mental defect which makes him … incapable – ( a ) of appreciating the wrongfulness of his or her act or omission ; or ( b ) of acting in accordance with an appreciation of the wrongfulness of his or her act or omission .
Roux says Vorster does not claim that Pistorius was incapable of distinguishing right from wrong ; indeed , she specifically ruled this out .
But Nel says Vorster conceded that generalised anxiety order "" might "" have affected his ability to tell right from wrong and on that basis the application is valid .
Judge Thokozile Masipa will be asked to rule on this , though we expect Vorster to continue with her cross - examination and re - examination first .
Monday was a dramatic day in court , as chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel made an application to the court to have Oscar Pistorius referred to a mental health institution to assess whether his diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder could have affected his actions on the night he shot and killed Reeva Steenkamp .
You can read a report of yesterday 's developments here .
Monday 's live blog is here .
You can follow my tweets for key developments and summaries here .
The court will resume on Tuesday morning to continue hearing evidence from Dr Merryll Vorster , the defence witness and forensic psychiatrist whose diagnoses ( she also says Pistorius has developed a depressive disorder since the killing ) prompted the application by the prosecution .
• Barry Roux , Pistorius ' lead lawyer , said the defence would oppose the application – to be made under section 78 of the Criminal Procedure Act – and said the athlete 's diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder did not mean he was incapable of distinguishing right from wrong .
•
The anxiety disorder stemmed from surgery at the age of 11 months to remove his lower legs , Vorster concluded , adding that a pre - verbal infant would view the operation as a "" traumatic assault "" .
•
His physical vulnerability as an adult made him more anxious , said Vorster : he could easily be pushed over on his stumps .
Since childhood , Pistorius was encouraged not to see himself as disabled , which meant he was unable to access the emotional support he needed , Vorster said .
•
His anxiety disorder left him "" hypervigilant "" about his personal safety ; he slept with his bedroom door locked and worried about his siblings ' safety when he was training overseas .
His mother , who died when Pistorius was 14 , slept with a firearm under her pillow and had an irrational fear of intruders ."
2014-05-14,
2014-05-14,"Judge Thokozile Masipa has ruled that Oscar Pistorius must be referred for psychiatric evaluation following evidence that his actions may have been affected by an anxiety disorder when he shot and killed Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine 's day last year .
â€¢
The court will reconvene on Tuesday to hear the details of the referral , including whether the state and judge will agree to the defence 's request that Pistorius be treated as an outpatient .
Masipa indicated she would be happy for him to be an outpatient , saying she did not intend for Pistorius to be "" punished twice "" .
â€¢ Judge Masipa said the lay court was "" ill - equipped "" to decide whether the diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder ought to be taken into account when considering the events of 14 February 2013 : The accused may not have raised the issue that he was not criminally responsible but evidence raised on his behalf clearly raises the issue and can not be ignored.ï
» ¿ â€¢ Referring Pistorius for psychiatric tests would ensure a fair trial , Masipa said .
The decision to grant the application would cause a further delay to the court proceedings , but this was necessary , she added : ï»¿This is not about anyone 's convenience , but rather about whether justice has been served .
â€¢
The observation would typically last 30 days .
For the experts to compile their reports could take a further 30 days .
Only then could the trial restart .
â€¢ Oscar Pistorius 's uncle , Arnold Pistorius , speaking outside the court , said the family was "" comfortable "" with the judge 's ruling .
That 's it for this live blog for today .
You can read a report on today 's developments here .
The live blog will be back on Tuesday morning , when the details of where , when and for how long Oscar Pistorius will undergo psychiatric testing will be revealed in court .
It looks as if that will be it from the high court today .
I will post a summary shortly .
In the meantime , you can read a report of today 's developments here .
Arnold Pistorius says the family is "" comforted "" by the judge 's decision to refer Oscar Pistorius for psychiatric assessment : This is about a fair trial .
The decision gives the family "" confidence "" in the justice system .
The judge was "" thorough "" , he says.ï » ¿ Arnold Pistorius , uncle of Oscar Pistorius , is talking to reporters outside the high court now .
He is not taking any questions .
There are reports that the Pistorius family is about to make a short statement .
Here is an extract from Judge Masipa 's ruling : Mental illness and mental defects are morbid disorders that are not capable of being diagnosed by a lay court without expert psychiatric evidence .
The accused may not have raised the issue that he was not criminally responsible at the time of the incident in so many words , but evidence led on his behalf clearly raised the issue and can not be ignored .
A referral inevitably means more delays in finalising this matter but this is not about anyone 's convenience , but rather about whether justice has been served .
Masipa said the decision to refer Pistorius was not intended to "" punish him twice"".ï » ¿ Pistorius stood in the dock today to hear Judge Masipa say she would allow the state 's application to have his mental condition assessed .
On Monday , when Gerrie Nel told the court he intended to bring the application , Pistorius told reporters the move was "" a joke "" .
The judge 's decision has come as a surprise even to those at the high court in Pretoria : Reuters has filed a brief report on this morning 's dramatic events : A South African court on Wednesday ordered Olympic and Paralympic track star Oscar Pistorius to undergo evaluation for mental illness , further delaying a murder trial that has already stretched into its 32nd day .
The state had asked for the evaluation after a psychiatrist told the court this week that Pistorius , who is on trial for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp last year , suffered from an anxiety disorder .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel has argued he wanted to prevent the 27-year - old sprinter , who faces life in prison if convicted , from later appealing on the basis of a disturbed mental condition .
Defence lawyer Barry Roux had argued against the motion , saying it was "" premature "" to have the evaluation done now , as he planned to call other witnesses .
But Judge Thokozile Masipa ruled that a mental assessment would ensure that Pistorius gets a fair trial .
Masipa said the court would hand down the details of the assessment on Tuesday , adding it would be preferable for him to undergo the evaluation as an outpatient .
When the trial began on 3 March 2014 , it was expected to last for three weeks .
That timetable , of course , has already been stretched â€ “
we are the 10th week now , although there have been several breaks .
Judge Masipa had previously mentioned her need to attend to other cases , including an appeal panel she is due to sit on in June .
The latest delay will be the lengthiest so far .
The court will presumably hear on Tuesday how soon Pistorius can begin his psychiatric observation â€ “ if he is permitted to do it as an outpatient , that should be rather sooner than if he needs to wait for an inpatient bed to become available .
The observation itself would then typically last 30 days .
For the experts to compile their reports could take a further 30 days .
Only then could the trial restart .
It is possible that Pistorius could receive his treatment in Sterkfontein psychiatric hospital .
Sterkfontein is a specialist forensic psychiatric hospital , part of the University of the Witwatersrand .
( Dr Vorster is vice - dean of the university . )
The university website says of the psychiatric units it runs : The acute psychiatric admission units are high turnover multidisciplinary units which provide specialist psychiatrist cover for casualty , as well as consultation - liaison psychiatry and outpatient psychiatry clinics over and above dedicated inpatient psychiatric care in designated units .
Each of the units provide a 24-hour emergency psychiatric consultation service through the casualties .
Patients urgently needing psychiatric intervention / assessment include those who are acutely suicidal , psychotic , aggressive or who need crisis intervention .
It is also common for psychiatrists to be called out to give advice on the management of delirium or other acute presentations with a behavioural component .
Emergency assessments are carried out on site in casualty by psychiatric medical officers or registrars under consultant supervision.ï
»
¿ Masipa made it clear that the evidence that effectively obliged her to grant the state 's application for referral was that of Dr Merryll Vorster , the forensic psychiatrist who is actually a defence witness .
Vorster met Pistorius only twice , both times in May this year , well after the trial had begun , and after Pistorius had given his evidence on the stand .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel made much of this timing , saying Pistorius 's team had needed a "" fall - back position "" after his poor performance giving evidence .
Some commentators say defence counsel Barry Roux erred in calling Vorster as a witness and introducing the diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder at such a late stage in the trial .
Judge Masipa indicated very early on when delivering her decision that she was tending towards the state case â€ “ her first mention of the defence 's opposition to the referral was to call it "" strange "" .
What needs to be decided by Tuesday ?
State and defence teams will need to decide which hospital he will be treated at , and whether the chosen institution has space for him .
They will be mindful of any further delays to the trial â€ “
the observation would generally last 30 days , but there might be a waiting period before treatment can start .
Judge Masipa indicated she was sympathetic to the defence request that Pistorius should be treated as an outpatient .
Waiting times for an inpatient place in a psychiatric hospital can be several months , South African media reports .
Masipa says the aim of the referral is not to punish the accused .
She agrees that the outpatient option would be preferable .
The court will adjourn until Tuesday , when the full ruling on the referral â€ “ including the terms â€ “ will be given .
Roux asks the judge to consider the option of Pistorius receiving treatment as an outpatient .
Masipa says she is satisfied the conditions of the application have been met .
The decision is not taken lightly , she says .
Has the state made a case that the referral is warranted , Masipa says .
The defence wants to call another witness .
But will that help the court on this issue , she says .
Vorster 's evidence can not replace a proper psychiatric enquiry , says Masipa .
The doctor met with Pistorius only twice .
A proper enquiry would ensure the accused receives a fair trial .
Pistorius may have another defence relating to his possible diminished criminal responsibility , says Masipa .
This lay court is ill - equipped to deal with the evidence of Dr Vorster at this stage .
Masipa notes that section 78 does not define mental illness or mental defect .
She has relied on case law for this .
Dr Vorster did not think generalised anxiety disorder was a mental illness , Masipa says .
But the psychiatrist did concede that his ability to act in accordance with his understanding of right and wrong was affected by this disorder .
Masipa moves on to testimony from Vorster about Pistorius 's "" hypervigilance "" around his fear of crime , his physical vulnerability and his anxiety disorder .
These factors were all operating at the time of the defence , she says .
They affected the athlete 's "" fight or flight "" response .
I do not agree that there are no allegations â€ ¦
The accused may not have raised the issue that he was not criminally responsible but evidence raised on his behalf clearly raise the issue and can not be ignored.ï » ¿
The trigger to the application was the evidence of Dr Merryll Vorster called on behalf of the accused.ï » ¿
But Masipa says the defence is not arguing that Pistorius was not criminally responsible when he shot Reeva Steenkamp .
It is clear that counsel for the state was correct when he said the court has no discretion .
It looks as if Judge Masipa is leaning towards the state 's side here.ï » ¿
Masipa says key part of section 78 is "" if it is alleged "" or "" if it appears "" â€ “ the implication here is that she does not feel the allegation of mental illness has to be proven , which Roux argued it must be .
Judge Masipa is talking about the relevant section 78 of the application , the state 's case and the defence opposition .
Strangely .
the application is opposed on behalf of the accused .
The court is back in session .
We are still waiting for the judge to arrive , 20 minutes after the court was due to resume .
Pistorius ' personal psychologist is talking with the defence legal team .
Gerrie Nel is not in the court room now ; nor is his prosecution colleague Andrea Johnson .
Reporters in the high court say Arnold Pistorius is now briefing family members , including Oscar Pistorius ' sister Aimee Pistorius .
Pistorius himself remains in the dock .
Arnold Pistorius , uncle of Oscar , has now joined the conversation .
Reporters in court say they look solemn , but it 's fruitless trying to second - guess the judge 's decision .
We need to wait for Judge Masipa to arrive .
Barry Roux , defence counsel , is now back in the court room and talking to Pistorius , along with another member of the defence legal team , Brian Webber .
Gerrie Nel is also back .
Hopefully this means the judge will be here soon .
Reporters in the high court say counsel for state and defence have been called to the judge 's chambers .
We expect the judge to begin giving her ruling shortly .
Pistorius himself is also in court : We expect Judge Masipa to arrive in court in five minutes or so .
Reporters in the high court in Pretoria say lots of members of the Pistorius family are already in the court room , along with his coach , Ampie Louw .
If the judge does not allow Gerrie Nel 's application to have Pistorius assessed , the defence is expected to plough straight on with further witnesses : After a dramatic day of arguments on Tuesday , the court reconvenes this morning to hear Judge Thokozile Masipa rule whether Oscar Pistorius must be referred for a 30-day mental health evaluation in hospital .
â€¢
The application was made by state prosecutor Gerrie Nel , who said the diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder made by forensic psychiatrist and defence witness
Dr Merryll Vorster , raised the possibility that the accused was suffering a mental illness when he shot and killed Reeva Steenkamp .
â€¢
The defence has opposed the application , saying it has "" no merit "" and is premature , as the defence intends to call more witnesses .
â€¢ Nel said the state did not and will not make the case that Pistorius was mentally ill .
But the evidence of Vorster is that his generalised anxiety disorder ( GAD ) might have affected his actions on the night he shot Steenkamp .
If the court chooses not to refer , it could have a bearing on a future appeal , Nel claimed .
â€¢
The application is made under section 78 of South Africa 's Criminal Procedure Act â€ “
there is a link to the full legislation here .
The key point is whether Pistorius : suffers from a mental illness or mental defect which makes him â€ ¦ incapable â€ “ ( a ) of appreciating the wrongfulness of his or her act or omission ; or ( b ) of acting in accordance with an appreciation of the wrongfulness of his or her act or omission .
If Judge Masipa rules today that Pistorius should be referred , it will cause a significant delay to the trial ( as Nel acknowledged ) .
Waiting lists for inpatient treatment at state - run mental health institutions around Pretoria are reported to be several months long , although it is possible the athlete 's case would be fast - tracked .
The observation usually takes 30 days .
If , however , she rejects the application , it is assumed that Roux will continue with his remaining witnesses .
He told the court on Tuesday that the next witness would deal with Pistorius 's "" fight or flight "" response .

2014-05-19,"Most of us have woken at night to an unfamiliar sound .
Those who have will know that the grogginess of sleep does little to dampen the surge in adrenaline .
The blood turns sour , and in a moment the heart is pounding at a rate that is frightening in itself .
This is the "" fight or flight "" response , the raw material of anxiety .
There is a threat abroad : we enter a state of hypervigilance .
The ability to experience this condition is the result of millions of years of evolution .
The better our fight or flight system , the more likely we are to escape from or overcome an adversary .
As with every aspect of our physiology , there is a natural variation in the threshold at which we begin to experience that sense of threat , and certain life events can also make us more sensitive to it .
Last week Oscar Pistorius was sent out of a court in Pretoria to undergo psychiatric tests .
These will determine whether any anxiety he experienced on the night he killed his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , was related to an existing problem .
If it was , then it is possible he could be absolved of any criminal responsibility for her death .
For most of human history differences in the way we think , feel and behave were thought of as personality traits .
When these differences were extreme , the person was labelled mad ( or , sometimes , a prophet ) .
But the fearful person â€ “ just like the shy person , the disobedient person or the easily distracted person â€ “ would not have been considered ill , just one of a range of constitutional types .
( There is a parlour game to be played in handing out contemporary diagnoses to characters from literature .
Did Heathcliff suffer from oppositional - defiant disorder ?
Was Raskolnikov schizoid ? )
Today , many of these types have been redefined as medical conditions .
This tendency is controversial , but can be the means by which those whose thoughts or feelings make them distressed , or a danger to themselves or others , get help .
What is increasingly clear is that it has seismic implications for the law .
The principle that an altered state of mind can excuse a crime is built into many legal systems .
The cause could be drink , a brain tumour that distorts judgment , or an episode of mental illness .
But as the empire of psychiatric diagnoses expands , taking in ever finer variations in personality , this will become much more difficult to navigate .
The argument is n't new : lawyers have long argued over what constitutes an impairment of reason .
What is changing is the ability of scientists to identify tiny differences in the brains and bodies of subjects , and link those to behaviour .
A cultural bias to "" hard "" data means that the biological carries more weight than the biographical with jurors and judges ( although the two are inextricably linked ) .
If a brain tumour can be used as a defence , then why not poor functioning in the pre - frontal cortex , or reduced blood flow in the angular gyrus ?
In the US the number of judicial opinions citing neurological evidence has increased by several hundred percent since 2005 , according to Nita Farahany , professor of law and philosophy at Duke University .
Judgment is certainly altered by anxiety .
The levels of important neurotransmitters may change and , over time , the mass of certain structures in the brain too .
We can not know what an unanxious version of Pistorius would have done that night .
The question is absurd , though , as the Pistorius we are dealing with is anxious .
Should that person not be held to account for any crime he may have committed ?
With our ability to scrutinise the brain improving all the time , it will become more and more difficult to maintain the fiction that the mind and body operate separately .
But as the line between disease and personality blurs , traditional ideas of blame and responsibility could start to fall apart .
Should we then abandon blame ?
Gwen Adshead , a consultant at Broadmoor hospital , has written that "" as clinicians we know mental illness does not necessarily abolish the capacity to form meaningful and competent intentions "" .
For her part Farahany believes that moral accountability is essential , even if we get to a point where we can closely map behaviour to biology .
"" We have some self - direction , "" she says .
"" While it may be limited , we are still clearly capable of making some decisions .
And without blame , society ca n't stigmatise the decisions and actions it wants to prevent .
"" New scientific techniques make the correlations between biology and behaviour much clearer .
But until we are ready to give up the idea of a mind that can choose , even in its darkest moments , blame will have to be part of the story .

2014-05-20,"You can read the report of today 's developments here .
A short hearing today , as Judge Masipa set out the terms of Pistorius 's mental health evaluation , agreed with both state and defence in advance .
â€¢ Pistorius will spend 30 days as an outpatient at Weskoppies state psychiatric hospital in Pretoria , beginning on Monday 26 May.
â€¢ He must attend every weekday between 9 am and 4 pm ( or until excused by the medical superintendent at the hospital ) .
â€¢ The four professionals overseeing his assessment include Dr Leon Fine , Professor Herman Pretorius and Dr Jonathan Scholtz .
â€¢ This panel will compile separate reports for the court to judge whether Pistorius was criminally liable for his actions , and whether he "" appreciated the wrongfulness of his conduct "" .
â€¢ Setting out the details and purpose of Pistorius 's evaluation , Masipa said : The panel [ of mental health professionals ] will establish whether the accused was by mental illness or defect criminally responsible for his actions.ï
» ¿
The panel will also seek to establish whether Pistorius appreciated the wrongfulness of his conduct.ï » ¿ â€¢ The court will resume on 30 June to hear the results of the evaluation .
That 's it for the live blog for today .
It will be back on 30 June when we hear the reports from the Weskoppies psychiatrists on whether , and how , the murder trial will proceed .
There has been some debate over whether the decision to allow Pistorius to be assessed as an outpatient constitutes "" special treatment "" .
This piece says being an outpatient allows several privileges : ï»¿This would mean he would face a shorter waiting period , remain on bail and , once the evaluation begins , return home each day .
But Mannie Witz , a criminal lawyer with the Bridge Group at the Johannesburg Bar , has said that under South Africa 's Criminal Procedure Act Pistorius must be treated as an inpatient because he did not volunteer for the evaluation . ""
He did n't ask to be referred , he opposed it , "" said Witz , who has been an advocate for more than 35 years
â€
¦ "" You ca n't give him any special treatment .
He must be treated the same as every other person that is standing trial , "" Witz told South Africa 's Channel 199 , which has been set up especially to broadcast the Pistorius trial .
Describing the country 's prisons and hospitals as "" clogged "" , he questioned why Pistorius should go to the front of the queue just because of "" who he is and because it is a high - profile trial "" .
When this trial began at the start of March , it was timetabled to last three weeks .
The judge 's decision to refer Pistorius for evaluation was inevitably going to prolong proceedings ; we will find out on 30 June by just how much .
If the panel of mental health professionals decide that Pistorius is not suffering from a mental illness that makes it impossible for the trial to proceed , it is likely the defence will continue with its remaining witnesses â€ “ Barry Roux told the judge last week that he had more to call , including one who would testify about Pistorius 's "" fight or flight "" reactions .
The judge mentioned the mental health professionals who will assess Pistorius and effectively decide the future of this trial .
One is Dr Leon Fine : he is listed here as a psychiatric specialising in "" Bipolar , Forensics , Medical Legal Specialist , Psychophrenia , Psychotherapy , Trauma Counselling "" .
Professor Herman Pretorius is a psychiatrist at Weskoppies .
Dr Jonathan Scholtz is listed here as a clinical psychologist .
This blog by a psychologist who trained at Weskoppies psychiatric hospital offers some insight on what form Pistorius 's evaluation could take : They will : Conduct lengthy psychiatric interviews in which they will obtain his full life history , his family background , his criminal history , and also importantly his psychiatric history .
Administer a range of psychological and other tests .
These will include personality tests , neuropsychological tests , tests for malingering ( the technical term for faking a mental illness ) and general cognitive tests that evaluate each and every cognitive process from intelligence to memory .
Each test can take between 30min â€ “ 3 hrs to complete .
It is an extremely rigorous process .
To give an example , the MMPI ( The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory ) has over 500 items .
Observe him during every single minute of every procedure .
In addition to the formal interviews and tests , OPâ€ ™ s every move will be scrutinized .
He will be evaluated on his appearance , attitude , behaviour , mood and cognitions .
After each member of the team has concluded theses procedures , they will then meet and together they will formulate a diagnosis.ï » ¿ Judge Masipa has set out the agreed terms of Oscar Pistorius 's mental health evaluation :
â€¢ He will spend 30 days as an outpatient at Weskoppies state psychiatric hospital in Pretoria , beginning on Monday 26 May.
â€¢ He must attend every weekday between 9 am and 4 pm ( or when excused by his doctors ) .
â€¢ The four professionals overseeing his assessment include Dr Leon Fine , Dr Herman Pretorius and Dr Jonathan Scholtz .
â€¢ This panel will compile separate reports for the court to judge whether Pistorius was criminally liable for his actions , and whether he "" appreciated the wrongfulness of his conduct "" .
â€¢ The court will resume on 30 June to hear the results of the evaluation .
From Judge Masipa 's ruling : The panel [ of mental health professionals ] will establish whether the accused was by mental illness or defect criminally responsible for his actions.ï
» ¿
The panel will also seek to establish whether Pistorius appreciated the wrongfulness of his conduct .
Both lawyers â€ “ Gerrie Nel for the state , Barry Roux for the defence â€ “ say they are in agreement .
The court will resume on 30 June once the medical staff tasked with assessing Pistorius 's mental health have filed their reports .
These staff will be responsible for determining for the court whether Pistorius was criminally responsible for his actions .
Masipa lists the medical staff who will be responsible for his assessment : His period of evaluation will begin on 26 May.
He must attend every weekday from 9 am to 4 pm , or until he is excused by medical staff .
We are about to hear Judge Masipa set out the terms of Pistorius 's mental health assessment .
Criminal responsibility in South African law relies on two key things â€ “ that an accused person is able : to appreciate the wrongfulness of his or her conduct .
to act in accordance with that appreciation .
The mental health assessment will be tasked with judging whether Pistorius was lacking in either of these .
Defence witness and forensic psychiatrist
Dr Merryll Vorster said she did not believe Pistorius was incapable of telling right from wrong .
But she did express some doubt over his ability to act in accordance with his understanding of right and wrong .
I was overly optimistic
earlier â€ “ the start of court proceedings is indeed delayed .
I understand from reporters in the high court that counsel for state and defence are in the judge 's chambers .
They also say June Steenkamp , Reeva Steenkamp 's mother , is not in court today .
My colleague David Shariatmadari has written an intriguing piece for Comment is Free on how far our state of mind can absolve us of responsibility for our actions :
The principle that an altered state of mind can excuse a crime is built into many legal systems .
The cause could be drink , a brain tumour that distorts judgment , or an episode of mental illness .

Should that person not be held to account for any crime he may have committed?ï » ¿ Reporters in Pretoria say all parties are in court already , suggesting we wo n't have the delayed start we had last Wednesday .
The stated aim of the judge in pausing proceedings until today was for all sides to reach agreement on the terms of the mental health order , so this morning 's hearing should reflect that â€ “ less adversarial than usual .
Various reports in the South African media suggest Pistorius is likely to be sent to Weskoppies psychiatric hospital in Pretoria .
Yahoo News offers some thoughts on what form the evaluation might take : The standard observation period is 30 days , but it will only begin when the required hospital resources become available .
During that period , a psychiatrist will assess the accused fairly frequently , psychological and other medical tests and investigations may be done , and the observations of nurses and others will be taken into account .
A report is then prepared for the court by a panel of experts , which will state whether Pistorius is fit to stand trial , if he was criminally responsible for his actions , and what they should take into account during verdict and sentencing .
South Africa has a shortage of forensic psychiatrists and facilities , with months - long waiting lists at most .
Legal experts estimate that Pistorius , being a high - profile case , will only have to wait for a week or so .
Presumably , being an outpatient will also reduce the waiting period , not requiring a bed.ï » ¿ Last week witnessed a dramatic interruption in the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp , as Judge Thokozile Masipa ruled he must undergo psychiatric assessment to determine whether mental illness played any part in the events of 14 February 2013 , when the athlete shot dead his girlfriend in his Pretoria home .
Pistorius pleads not guilty to murder , claiming he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder .
Judge Masipa said on Wednesday that the court was ill - equipped to decide whether the diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder raised by a defence witness had affected Pistorius 's actions .
She said further psychiatric tests were necessary to ensure a fair trial .
The defence had opposed the application by the state to refer him for evaluation , pointing out that neither side was arguing that Pistorius was mentally ill when he shot Steenkamp .
But its argument was undermined by evidence given by one of its own witnesses , forensic psychiatrist Dr Merryll Vorster , who told the court that Pistorius 's generalised anxiety disorder , combined with his physical vulnerability â€ “
he had both lower legs amputated as a baby â€
“ could have affected his actions .
Vorster told the court : He certainly was able to appreciate the difference between right and wrong , but it may be that his ability to act in accordance with such appreciation was affected by this generalised anxiety disorder .
Explaining her decision , Masipa said : "" The accused may not have raised the issue that he was not criminally responsible at the time of the incident in so many words , but evidence led on his behalf clearly raised the issue and can not be ignored . ""
A referral inevitably means more delays in finalising this matter but this is not about anyone 's convenience , but rather about whether justice has been served . ""
The court will reconvene this morning to hear the terms of the mental health evaluation , including whether the state and judge will agree to the defence 's request that Pistorius be treated as an outpatient .
The athlete is currently on bail .

2014-05-20,"A panel of psychiatrists will decide whether Oscar Pistorius was criminally responsible for the shooting that killed his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , after his murder trial was postponed for his mental health to be assessed .
The athlete will begin a 30-day psychiatric evaluation on Monday at Weskoppies hospital , a state institution in Pretoria , South Africa .
But Judge Thokozile Masipa agreed with the defence that the Olympic and Paralympic sprinter should be assessed as an outpatient , attending the hospital only on weekdays between 9 am and 4 pm .
The decision was taken in part to speed up the already delayed trial process – the wait for an inpatient bed can be several months – but has been interpreted by some observers as "" preferential treatment "" .
Setting out the terms of Pistorius 's evaluation , Masipa said : "" The panel [ of mental health professionals ] will establish whether the accused was by mental illness or defect criminally responsible for his actions . ""
The panel will also seek to establish whether Mr Pistorius was capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act , or of acting in accordance with an appreciation of the wrongfulness of his act . ""
Dr Merryll Vorster , a defence witness and forensic psychiatrist , had previously told the court she did not believe Pistorius was incapable of telling right from wrong .
But she did express doubt over his ability to act in accordance with his understanding of right and wrong .
Pistorius denies murdering Steenkamp , claiming to have mistaken her for an intruder .
The panel overseeing Pistorius 's assessment will include Dr Leon Fine , a psychiatric and medical legal specialist ; Professor Herman Pretorius , a psychiatrist at Weskoppies hospital ; and Dr Jonathan Scholtz , a clinical psychologist .
The defence had opposed the application by the state to refer Pistorius for evaluation , pointing out that neither side was arguing that he was mentally ill when he shot Steenkamp .
But its argument was undermined by the evidence given by Vorster , who told the court that the athlete 's generalised anxiety disorder , combined with his physical vulnerability – he had both lower legs amputated as a baby – could have affected his actions .
This testimony can not be ignored , ruled Masipa .
The court will resume on 30 June to hear the reports filed by the medical panel .
Should they rule that Pistorius does not lack criminal capacity under South African law , the murder trial will continue , with the defence indicating it will call further witnesses .
If they find that Pistorius 's actions were significantly affected by mental illness , however , the trial could be forced to end immediately with a verdict of not guilty .
Any diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder could also be used to argue for a reduced sentence if he is convicted of murder ."
2014-06-04,"Internet phishing scammers are targeting fans of Oscar Pistorius with bogus Facebook pages that solicit public donations to fight the murder charge against him .
The latest such con appears on a profile purporting to be that of Carl Pistorius , the athlete 's older brother , and has been condemned by his family , who are seeking to shut it down .
Pistorius , on trial for shooting dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp , is undergoing a 30-day mental evaluation at a psychiatric hospital in Pretoria , South Africa .
As the case drags on , he has been forced to sell his house to meet spiralling legal bills .
According to South Africa 's Star newspaper , the fake Facebook page , which includes a photo of Carl , states : "" We seek financial support for the trial , debts and pending projects we have at hand .
If you are interested in working actively with us in this direction , please do contact :
Mrs Victoria Anderson at vicandersonl@hotmail.com .
"" The page 's most recent wall post read :
"" Thank You all for the continued support and words of encouragement during this difficult time .
Pray for Oscar . ""
The owner of the vicandersonl@hotmail.com account did not respond to an email sent on Wednesday .
Anneliese Burgess , a spokesperson for Pistorius , told the Star that people responding to the scam were asked to rendezvous in Sunnyside in Pretoria to talk about potential investments .
She warned against going to such a meeting . ""
The family has made it clear that anyone soliciting money on their behalf are doing so fraudulently , "" she was quoted as saying .
"" We will , once again request Facebook to shut this profile down .
All the legitimate Pistorius family members ' Facebook pages are either deactivated or set on full privacy settings . ""
In March , when the trial began in the glare of the world 's media , a sham Facebook page called "" Oscar Pistorius Official "" tried a similar con trick and was eventually shut down .
Fraudsters also used Twitter to redirect people to a false account .
Members of Pistorius 's family are known to be concerned about the escalating costs of the trial .
His legal team includes three of South Africa 's leading defence lawyers , a number of ballistics and forensic experts and , media reports say , an American crime scene reconstruction company .
The total cost has been estimated at Â£5,400 a day .
The Paralympian has meanwhile lost lucrative sponsorship deals because of the case .
Last month his estate agent announced that he had sold the luxury home , valued at more than Â£280,000 , where he killed Steenkamp , a model and law graduate .
Pistorius denies murder , insisting that he panicked because he thought he heard an intruder .
He was admitted as a day patient by the Weskoppies hospital following an order by judge Thokozile Masipa after a defence expert witness testified that the 27-year - old has generalised anxiety disorder ( GAD ) .
South African media reported this week that the psychiatrist 's suggestion has caused panic among the disorder 's sufferers .
The Sunday Times quoted Cassey Chamber , director of the SA Depression and Anxiety Group , as saying it had received "" hundreds of calls "" from people concerned that having the disorder could lead to "" unpredictable , unstable and violent "" behaviour .
"" We have had people asking if their loved ones with GAD need to be hospitalised immediately . ""
She added : "" Anxiety is an introspective issue and sufferers of GAD are highly unlikely to be dangerous to others . ""
Pistorius 's trial is due to resume at the high court in Pretoria on 30 June ."
2014-06-20,"British businessman Shrien Dewani will stand trial on 6 October for the murder of his wife on their honeymoon if a panel of psychiatric experts deems him mentally fit , a South African court ruled on Friday .
Dewani , making a third court appearance in Cape Town since his extradition from the UK in April , was ordered to undergo a similar mental evaluation to that of athlete Oscar Pistorius , who is also charged with murder .
Prosecutors applied for the 30-day test after receiving two conflicting psychiatric reports on Dewani , the Western Cape high court was told .
Defence lawyer Francois van Zyl did not oppose the application and said he believed Dewani would be able to stand trial . ""
The accused will be ready , fit to plead for the trial to proceed on 6 October , but of course it is subject to what the panel finds , "" he told the judge , John Hlophe .
Wearing a dark suit and white shirt , a clean - shaven Dewani looked anxious and muttered to himself at one point , apparently struggling to hear as the judge made the order .
After the brief hearing he was led down to the holding cells while his family sat close by the dock .
The 34-year - old is receiving treatment at Valkenberg psychiatric hospital in Cape Town .
He will appear in court again on 15 August , when a decision is expected on whether the trial can proceed on the agreed date .
Dewani , from Bristol , denies paying three men to kill his 28-year - old wife during their honeymoon in Cape Town in November 2010 .
Dewani claims that he and Anni were carjacked at gunpoint as they drove through the Gugulethu township .
Dewani escaped unharmed , but his wife suffered a fatal shot in the neck .
Her body was found in the abandoned taxi the following day .
Prosecutors claim that Dewani hired a South African , Xolile Mngeni , to murder his spouse .
Mngeni was jailed for life for the murder in December 2012 .
He was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour soon after his arrest and is now critically ill in hospital .
Two other men , also jailed over the killing , claim that Dewani orchestrated it .
The state is expected to argue that Dewani is gay and plotted to have his wife killed to escape an arranged marriage .
He faces a minimum of 25 years in prison if found guilty of the five charges he faces .
Dewani returned to Britain shortly after Anni 's murder and fought extradition for three years , claiming he had mental health problems including depression and post - traumatic stress .
If he is unfit to face trial within 18 months he will be returned to Britain , under the terms of his extradition .
Pistorius , who shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in what he claims was an accident , is nearing the end of his 30-day assessment as an outpatient at Weskoppies psychiatric hospital , west of Pretoria .
His trial is due to resume on 30 June ."
2014-06-29,"Oscar Pistorius returns to the dock on Monday after a month of psychiatric tests to determine whether mental illness played any part in his actions on the night he shot dead his girlfriend .
The Paralympian will be back in the high court in Pretoria , the capital of South Africa , after a six - week gap that left one of the most world 's most eagerly watched murder trials in limbo .
Pistorius is accused of murdering Reeva Steenkamp , a model and law graduate , at his home on Valentine 's Day last year .
The 27-year - old denies the charge and insists he opened fire by accident after mistaking her for an intruder .
Pistorius , who has since been staying at his uncle 's mansion , was assessed as an outpatient over 30 days at Weskoppies psychiatric hospital in Pretoria .
On Monday the trial judge , Thokozile Masipa , is expected to receive the reports of a panel of one psychologist and three psychiatrists who evaluated whether the athlete was suffering a generalised anxiety disorder that could have impaired his ability to distinguish right from wrong when he shot Steenkamp through a locked toilet door .
One of the psychiatrists , Dr Leon Fine , was hospitalised on Thursday after reportedly suffering a heart attack but this is not expected to delay the resumption of the trial .
Nathi Mncube , a spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority , told the Saturday Star newspaper : "" We are expecting the reports to be handed in on Monday and the case should proceed .
How we will proceed will be determined by the judge and by the outcome of the reports .
But Pistorius has to be at court . ""
On 20 May the court ruled that Pistorius 's observation would inquire if he was "" at the time of the commission of the offence criminally responsible "" and if he could appreciate the "" wrongfulness of his actions and act according to that appreciation "" .
The prosecutor Gerrie Nel has alleged that Pistorius killed the 29-year - old model after an argument and is an arrogant gun obsessive who refuses to take responsibility for his actions .
But he requested an independent inquiry into his state of mind after a forensic psychiatrist , Dr Merryll Vorster , testified that Pistorius 's generalised anxiety disorder , combined with his physical vulnerability â€ “
he had both lower legs amputated as a baby â€
“ could have affected his actions .
Vorster , a defence witness , told the court : "" He certainly was able to appreciate the difference between right and wrong , but it may be that his ability to act in accordance with such appreciation was affected by this generalised anxiety disorder . ""
Kelly Phelps , a senior lecturer in the public law department at the University of Cape Town , told the Associated Press that if the panel backed Vorster 's diagnosis it could add weight to Pistorius 's account and compel the judge to consider the question : "" Is it more likely that he is telling the truth about what occurred on that night ? ""
Even if the judge rules that Pistorius is guilty despite any disorder that he is suffering , Phelps added , the diagnosis could be a mitigating factor when he is sentenced .
"" That is the area of law that is often referred to as diminished responsibility , "" she added .
Once Masipa receives the conclusions from the mental health experts , it is thought the defence will call around three more witnesses , prior to closing arguments and Masipa 's deliberation on a verdict .
If , however , the experts who observed Pistorius are not unanimous in their conclusions , the judge can call them to the stand to clarify their findings .
There are no juries at trials in South Africa , so the fate of the "" blade runner "" will ultimately be decided by the judge , assisted by two assessors .
If found guilty of murder , Pistorius could face life imprisonment .
If he is acquitted of that charge , the court will consider an alternative charge of culpable homicide ."
2014-06-30,"A busy – and at times highly technical – day of evidence in the Oscar Pistorius murder trial .
Here are the key points : •
The report from a panel of mental health experts concludes , after a 30-day psychiatric evaluation , that Pistorius was not suffering from a "" mental disorder or defect "" when he shot Reeva Steenkamp , and was not incapable of telling right from wrong , or of acting on that understanding of right and wrong .
•
The court has not yet heard the full details of the report .
But both state and defence indicated they did not contest its main findings .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said he might want to come back to points raised later in the trial .
•
The court did not hear if the psychiatrists support the diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder .
But the panel did conclude the athlete suffers from post - traumatic stress disorder and depression .
•
Defence acoustics expert Ivan Lin said screams from the locked toilet were ' unlikely ' to be heard in neighbours ' bedrooms 177 m away , contradicting testimony from a state witness who said she heard a woman 's "" blood - curdling "" cries on the night Reeva Steenkamp was killed .
He said it was not always possible to tell whether a scream was made by a man or a woman ; the defence claims that neighbours who say they heard a woman 's cries in fact heard a distressed Pistorius calling for help .
•
The surgeon who amputated Pistorius ' legs as a baby said the athlete would be "" severely impaired "" in a dangerous situation , and would be unable to flee if on his stumps .
He said Pistorius lacked proprioception and would have needed to hold on to something for balance if moving around in the dark .
•
The judge was asked to examine Pistorius on his stumps in the courtroom ; this was not filmed .
•
Judge Masipa has said she is "" very unhappy "" at the state 's failure to produce an electrical cord that was in Pistorius ' bedroom on the night of the shooting .
The cord appeared in police photographs but was not listed on an inventory of items removed from the house .
The defence says its disappearance compromises the case because the cord was raised by Nel in cross - examination of Pistorius .
Masipa ordered the officer in charge of securing the house to account for what happened .
The court has adjourned until Tuesday morning , when state prosecutor Gerrie Nel will cross - examine Lin .
The witness shows the court his sound measuring equipment .
He asks everyone to be quiet so he can measure the ambient noise level .
It is 38 decibels .
Roux :
What is the sound level of me talking ?
Lin : It 's 45 dBA .
Roux has no further questions .
Nel takes over for cross - examination .
But he says he needs time to go through Lin 's report and wants to consult on it .
Can the court break for the day , he asks .
The judge agrees .
Court adjourns for the day .
The trial will resume at 9.30am
( South African time ) on Tuesday .
I will post a summary of today 's developments shortly .
We are back to the different combinations of where the sound came from , and where the listeners were , and how audible or intelligible any screams would have been .
If listeners were 177 m away in a bedroom and the sound came from the bathroom , the sound would not have been audible or intelligible , Lin says .
If listeners were in the bedroom 177 m away and the source of scream was on the balcony , the range would be unlikely audible to possibly intelligible .
Roux asks whether Lin took barking dogs into consideration ( other witnesses have said there were dogs barking that night ) .
Lin says he did n't , but it would have interfered with sound perception .
The court recording of Lin 's testimony seems to be fine .
Roux continues with his questioning of the witness , an acoustics expert .
( That 's the 30-day adjournment for Pistorius ' psychiatric assessment , not today 's breaks . )
Dr Michelle Burger , a state witness , testified earlier in the trial that she and her husband had heard "" blood - curdling screams "" from Pistorius 's home , in a gated community , 580 feet ( 177 metres ) away from her own home , on the night Steenkamp was killed .
Burger told the court : It was very traumatic .
You could hear it was bloodcurdling screams .
You ca n't translate it into words .
The anxiousness in her voice , and fear .
It leaves you cold .
She screamed terribly and she yelled for help .
It was something you ca n't explain to someone else , how anxious those screams were .
Just after her screams , I heard shots , four shots : bang … bang , bang , bang .
I heard petrified screaming before the gunshots and just after the gunshots .
I could n't understand why Mr Pistorius did n't hear the screams of the woman .
And if he did n't hear the screams of the woman , that 's a question that needs to be asked to Mr Pistorius .
Lin has just testified that at 177 m , a scream from the locked toilet would have been not audible or extremely unlikely to be audible .
The court takes a short break to check that the stenographer 's machine is recording properly ( see here for the earlier technical hitch on that ) .
Lin : The listeners could have heard a scream from 80 m away , irrespective if it was from toilet , bathroom or balcony .
However , at 177 m away , if the scream was from the toilet , it is very unlikely the listener [ in a bedroom ] could have heard the scream , let alone interpret it .
Lin says the objective scientific process indicates that listeners may have heard scream from 80 m away , but not at 177 m .
Lin moves on to a situation where a scream came from the toilet .
If the listener was on a balcony , the sound would be "" audible and possibly intelligible "" .
But if the listener were in a bedroom , says Lin , the sounds can range from "" not audible to extremely unlikely to be audible "" .
He concludes that if the sound emanated from the bathroom and the listener was on a balcony , the sound would be both audible and intelligible .
If the listeners were in a bedroom , the sound would still be in that range .
Lin describes the expected sound levels at 180 m away from the toilet , bedroom , bathroom and balcony , based on an average human scream of 110 decibels .
Acoustics expert Ivan Lin is still giving evidence for the defence .
He continues to list the various factors that can affect how sound travels and is interpreted by the listener : weather , air pressure , balcony and bathroom doors .
Watch prosecutor Gerrie Nel outline the key findings of Oscar Pistorius ' psychiatric evaluation here :
A busy morning in court so far .
Here 's what we 've learned : •
The report from a panel of mental health experts concludes , after a 30-day psychiatric evaluation , that Pistorius was not suffering from a "" mental disorder or defect "" when he shot Reeva Steenkamp , and was not incapable of telling right from wrong , or of acting on that understanding of right and wrong .

Acoustics expert
Ivan Lin has begun his evidence for the defence .
He said it was not possible always to tell the difference between a man and a woman screaming – a key point in the defence version of events .
The court has now adjourned for lunch , after which Lin is expected to continue his testimony .
Roux suggests this would be a good time for the court to adjourn .
The judge agrees .
Break for lunch .
I 'll post a summary of this morning 's developments shortly .
Temperature , humidity , wind and atmospheric pressure also influence sound dissemination , Lin says .
Lin says it is impossible to replicate exactly the original conditions when reconstructing the sounds – that is , the screams – of the night in question .
The window in the bathroom was closed , Lin says .
This reduces the sound , as does the closed toilet door .
The sound would have deteriorated further over the 80 m distance to the witnesses who heard it , he adds .
Lin says his team has found no reliable evidence that it is possible always to differentiate between a man and a woman screaming .
Lin is dealing with the technical basis of his report : He says what is heard may be affected by other information learned after the event , so correct interpretation is not always guaranteed .
( This presumably will assist the defence case that neighbours said they heard a woman screaming because they knew later that Steenkamp had been killed . )
Lin says his report considered whether one can reliably tell the difference between a male and a female scream from a distance , and whether one can accurately hear emotion in a voice at that distance .
The defence has maintained that neighbours who testified they heard a woman screaming in fact heard Pistorius , who it claims screams like a woman when distressed .
Lin confirms he has compiled a report and this is handed to the court .
He says he is an electrical engineer , practising as an acoustics engineer since 1992 .
His current firm is Pro Acoustic Consulting Engineers .
Roux returns to his other "" housekeeping "" points , handing up to the judge the report from Roger Dixon , a defence forensics witness , and another report from the Silverwoods estate that was "" overlooked "" .
His final point , regarding a photo of an ambulance , wo n't be raised at this time .
Roux calls the next witness , acoustics expert Ivan Lin .
Masipa :
The house was locked ?
And there was no burglary during that time ?
She orders that whoever was in charge of securing the house on 14 and 15 February 2013 depose an affidavit to explain what happened.﻿ Lots of things were left at the house and not seized by police , Nel says .
But this item is relevant , Masipa points out .
Masipa says the defence 's call for an investigation is a "" fair request "" .
Nel consults with his team .
He says he does n't see how this would help .
It might not assist Roux , but it would assist me , says Judge Masipa .
She repeats that she is "" very unhappy "" about the situation .
Roux says the cord became relevant during Nel 's cross - examination of Pistorius , when the prosecutor claimed the cord could not have extended to be where the athlete said it was .
The state must at least investigate this , Roux says .
Nel says the state has looked for the cord among its exhibits and talked to the person charged with compiling the inventory .
He says he ca n't think of anywhere else to look .
Pistorius ' house has now been sold .
Roux says the cord is not at the house ; the defence has looked for it there .
He says the police had possession of the house .
On 14 February , the cord was there ( as seen in photographs ) .
In the next set of photos , the cord is not there , he says .
Nel says the police did not make an inventory of everything they left behind in the house .
The key was handed by police to estate manager Johan Stander , who passed it on to the defence team .
Masipa says she is not happy .
Nel says he can not account for it .
But the cord was not seized by the police , he says , or kept as an exhibit .
Has anyone tried to look for it , Masipa asks : Since the request was made by the defence , did someone try to find it ?
Nel is looking uncharacteristicly uncomfortable as the judge presses him on this .
The judge says it is agreed that the electrical cord was in the house on 14 February 2013 , when Steenkamp was shot .
On 15 February it was not in the same position , Nel says .
And here 's why this is a point of contention : There have also been questions over the competence of the initial police inquiry : Masipa says she is "" very concerned "" about this .
Roux says the court should order the state to make the cord available to the defence .
It 's not good enough to say ' we do n't have it ' , Roux argues .
What happened to it ?
The defence case is prejudiced without it .
Nel says the state does not have it .
The court can not order him to make something available that he does n't have .
Was there no inventory , asks the judge ?
There was , but the cord is not on it , Nel answers .
Roux says there are four things he needs to do before he can call his next witness .
•
He has a photograph he wants Nel to agree to be admitted as evidence ( no detail on what this is yet ) .
•
Roux says that during the adjournment they checked on the electrical cord that Nel had asked about , and whether it could be extended or not .
The police say they do n't have it , even thought it was seen in some police photos .
•
The defence has a report on some earlier evidence that has not been handed up to the judge .
•
There is also a report from earlier witness Roger Dixon that was not handed up .
Dr Versfeld has finished his evidence and is excused .
Roux says his next witness is ready but he needs a five - minute break first .
Versfeld says he has not witnessed Pistorius running on his stumps , only walking .
He says his walking is "" quite cumbersome "" .
It would n't be running as you or
I know it.﻿ Roux asks Versfeld about the effects of adrenaline on Pistorius in a dangerous situation .
The witness says it is well known that adrenaline allows people to do more than they would normally manage .
This could have over - ridden the pain in his stumps , Roux argues .
Roux says Pistorius fired with his elbows towards his chest , not outstretched as Nel suggested , and used his hand to balance against the cupboard .
Versfeld says Roux 's description would make sense as it would protect him from falling .
Roux reads from the record of Pistorius ' testimony ; he said when he fetched his firearm he used his hand on floor to balance .
Versfeld says that is consistent with his assessment .
There was "" some illumination "" , Roux argues : "" He 's not walking in the dark . ""
Roux says Pistorius ' evidence was that he used his hand to balance against the cupboards on his way .
Nel points out the many potential obstacles in the bedroom – electric wires , duvet , iPad , fans – that could have tripped Pistorius in the dark .
But with that he 's done , and Roux rises for the re - examination .
He argues that the small blue light from the amplifier means it was not pitch dark , and that amount of light could be enough to assist Pistorius ' balance .
Nel asks if Versfeld "" had the trial in mind "" when he assessed Pistorius in May.
Versfeld agrees that the information was for the court .
If it were "" pitch dark "" , says Nel , there could have been things in the way , such as electric cords , that could have caused the accused to fall over ?
Versfeld agrees .
Nel goes over the questions that were not picked up due to the fault in the stenographer 's recording equipment : on the light ( or lack of ) , and Pistorius ' alleged vulnerability in the face of danger .
Nel : If he had a weapon , his ability to ward off danger would not be severely impaired .
Versfeld :
He 's still impaired , but not as impaired as he would be if he did not have a weapon .
Nel is restarting his cross - examination of Dr Versfeld , the defence witness and surgeon who amputated Pistorius ' lower legs .
Nel is still concerned with the question of how well Pistorius would have been able to get around in the dark on his stumps .
Perhaps the problem with the stenographer 's machine is proving tricky :
( South African media confirm the machine is not an old - style stenographer 's typewriter but recording equipment . )
Associated Press has filed this report on the conclusions of the mental health panel : ﻿A panel of mental health experts has concluded that Oscar Pistorius was not suffering from a mental illness when he killed girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in his home last year , the chief prosecutor at the athlete 's murder trial said Monday .
Pistorius 's trial resumed after a break of one month during which a psychologist and three psychiatrists also assessed whether the double - amputee runner was capable of understanding the wrongfulness of his act when he shot Steenkamp through a closed toilet door .
The panel 's reports were submitted to Judge Thokozile Masipa , and prosecutor Gerrie Nel referred to key parts of the conclusions , noting that the experts believed Pistorius was "" capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act "" when he killed Steenkamp .
You can read the key points from what the court has heard about the report here .
Nel refers to Versfeld 's report , in which he says the accused would be severely impaired in warding off danger without a weapon .
Why did he write that ?
It 's true , the witness says .
A problem : the stenographer 's machine has stopped working .
The judge is quizzing the court clerk on when it went wrong .
Masipa says the court will need to stop for tea early to resolve the problem "" and allow the machine to come back to life "" .
Nel : Running back from the bathroom in the pitch dark , would you expect the accused to fall ?
Versfeld :
It would be difficult …
he would have a high risk of falling .
Nel :
But if he could see , the risk of falling would be less ?
Versfeld :
Correct.﻿
Nel says he 's not claiming the accused said this .
But if it were pitch dark in the room , would Pistorius have to hold on to something to walk around without falling over ?
Versfeld says he would .
Nel asks a colleague to pass him a laptop , then some papers , so he can check the record on what Pistorius said about the lighting .
The only light in the bedroom was a "" tiny , tiny blue light "" , says Nel , which came from an amplifier .
Roux says there are other places in the testimony where Pistorius deals with what he could see .
The evidence was not that it was "" pitch dark "" , he says .
Judge Masipa : If we keep going like this , we will never finish .
Is it really possible for Pistorius to have done all this in the dark , on his stumps , asks Nel .
Versfeld says he does not know how dark it was .
He probably would have needed to hold on to things for balance , the witness says .
That comment helps the state , says Nel – Pistorius says it was pitch dark .
Roux objects – there were different levels of lighting at different stages , he says .
Nel turns to Pistorius ' own account of moving the fans from the balcony into the room , which he said he did on his stumps .
He is keen to suggest that the athlete is not as vulnerable or unstable without his prostheses as this witness ' evidence claims .
Versfeld says he would not necessarily have carried the fan for three metres .
He could have used it as a walking aid .
Reporters in court say Pistorius is shaking his head and talking to his lawyers as he listens to Nel 's questioning .
Nel says Pistorius moved fans from his balcony , searched his room , and never fell .
He walked back to the bathroom with the firearm in his hand .
He did not fall .
So it is possible for him to do that ?
Versfeld agrees .
Nel : If the accused stood with his back against the wall , that would assist him ?
Versfeld﻿ :
If he was leaning against something , that would have a big beneficial effect …
He 's definitely in a better position from a balancing point of view .
Nel : That would be a deliberate decision ?
( Pistorius ' version is that he stood with his back against the far wall of the bathroom because he was fearful .
Nel seems to be implying that it was a deliberate means of circumventing the recoil problem . )
Roux objects that Nel is putting an "" incomplete "" version of Pistorius ' account to the witness .
Nel says he will get to his point .
Judge Masipa allows him to continue .
How would firing four shots on his stumps affect him , Nel asks .
It 's possible to do but he would have severe difficulty , Versfeld replies .
There would be a recoil problem that could knock him off his stumps .
Versfeld says he never asked Pistorius what happened on the night he shot Steenkamp , and Pistorius did not offer an explanation .
Nel says Versfeld 's conclusions that Pistorius would have been very vulnerable in a dangerous situation go beyond clinical observation .
Pistorius could not simply run away , Versfeld says .
Even turning around is "" quite a process "" , he says .
Turning 180 degrees requires around seven movements .
But he would be able to run away from the bathroom , Nel says – because that 's what he did .
And he never fell .
I did n't say he falls every time , says Versfeld .
Versfeld says he tried to create an "" objective scenario "" : carrying out clinical tests and taking x - rays to verify what Pistorius told him .
Nel says the witness is not qualified to make an assessment of Pistorius ' alleged vulnerability .
This was the deduction I made from those findings , Versfeld says .
The court makes the deductions , Nel counters .
Nel makes a glancing reference to the report filed this morning by the psychiatrists , and says they conclude the athlete suffers from post - traumatic stress disorder and depression .
Nel :
You saw a person for whom it was very important to demonstrate vulnerability … inability to walk .
Versfeld :
I ca n't dispute that.﻿
Nel asks if Versfeld has watched the trial coverage .
He says he has seen "" snippets "" on the news and did not watch Pistorius ' testimony , but agrees he has a "" good idea "" of the accused 's version of events .
Pistorius concluded his evidence on 15 April .
Versfeld saw him on 7 May. Nel is interested in the timing .
Versfeld says Pistorius had a bruise on his right mid - thigh after the shooting , which the witness says was caused by a fall .
Roux is finished .
Nel now begins his cross - examination .
Why would Pistorius struggle to balance more in the dark , Roux asks ?
Versfeld talks about proprioception , which enables able - bodied people to balance even when they ca n't see .
Pistorius lacks proprioception in his joints , particularly his knee .
If he has no visual reference , he will fall , says the witness .
Roux moves on to the night of Reeva Steenkamp 's death , and the striking of the toilet door with the cricket bat .
Versfeld :
When he is holding something with two hands , he has a severe problem of balancing .
I do n't believe he 'd be able to strike anything with any force with two hands .
He would overbalance and fall down …
If he swung with any force , he would topple over.﻿
Versfeld says Pistorius is very vulnerable in a dangerous situation .
His ability to ward off danger or to flee is "" severely impaired "" .
Versfeld says that , when walking on his stumps without holding on to something , Pistorius "" finds himself in danger of falling "" .
He falls often .
His ability to turn around is "" severely impaired "" .
In a dangerous situation , his ability to flee is significantly impaired , Versfeld says .
Dr Versfeld , the surgeon who amputated Pistorius ' legs as a baby , is still giving evidence .
He is testifying to the vulnerability of Pistorius when he 's without his prostheses .
Versfeld says there is "" marked tenderness "" on Pistorius ' left stump .
The soft tissues "" snap "" audibly as they move , he says .
Judge Masipa and her assessors now return to their seats .
Roux asks for another short adjournment so that Pistorius can put his prostheses back on and return to the dock .
Versfeld says he could show them how the heel pad moves backwards and "" snaps "" , but says that would cause Pistorius pain .
The severe pain causes him to fall down , Versfeld adds .
Versfeld says the soft tissue around Pistorius ' stumps is "" very , very mobile "" – the heel pad slips backwards when he puts weight on it , causing pain and instability .
There will be no photographs or filming of the demonstration of Pistorius on his stumps .
Judge Masipa and her assessors come down from the bench and walk across the courtroom floor to be closer to the demonstration .
We have not heard extensive details from the report , with all sides ( including the judge ) indicating they need more time to read through its findings .
But the key points from this morning : • Pistorius was not suffering from a "" mental disorder or defect "" when he shot Reeva Steenkamp .
•
Pistorius was not incapable of telling right from wrong , and was not incapable of acting on that understanding of right and wrong .
•
Neither state nor defence objects to the conclusions of the report .
•
We are yet to hear if the psychiatrists support the diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder .
•
The psychiatrists conclude the athlete now suffers from post - traumatic stress disorder and depression .
[ 09.49BST update : further information from Nel ]
After the break , it looks as if Roux will ask Pistorius to demonstrate his instability on his stumps : The tip of the bony stump does not have the protection of the heel pad , Versfeld says .
Roux asks for a short adjournment .
Court breaks for five minutes .
Versfeld says there is a fragment of bone at the base of Pistorius ' leg that is the remnant of his original heel .
The aim in surgery was to have the heel pad at the bottom of the stump , he says , but it has moved to the back of the stump .
The surgeon is now showing the judge x - rays taken of Pistorius ' legs in May this year .
They are not being displayed to the court .
Versfeld says Pistorius measures 1.56 m on his stumps .
He is 1.86 m tall with his prostheses .
With his prostheses on , Pistorius weighed 79 kg .
Versfeld moves on to his own assessment of Pistorius .
He says the heel pads – at the base of his stumps – could be easily moved , resulting in soft tissue moving out of place and causing pain .
When he put weight on the left stump , his knee buckled …
He walked with difficulty without holding on …
He could not walk on the industrial carpeting .
He had difficulty standing and was moving all the time .
The left leg actually buckled when he put weight on it.﻿ The witness is relating what Pistorius has said about using his prostheses .
He gets back pain from using his artificial legs and can not stand for more than an hour without finding them constricting .
He is easily pushed over from front or back .
Versfeld reads from his report what Pistorius told him about standing and walking on his stumps .
He ca n't stand for long , maybe one or two minutes , before it starts to hurt .
It is more difficult on hard surfaces .
In the dark , he struggles and needs to hold on to things .
He is easily pushed over .
He needs his arms to balance and can not easily carry something while on his stumps .
Pistorius told his doctor he falls frequently , at least once a week or two weeks .
He sometimes falls down when getting out of bed .
He will sometimes go to the bathroom without prostheses , but would not go into the rest of the house without them .
Versfeld says Pistorius was "" a small baby "" when he first saw him .
He had congenital deformities affecting both legs , the surgeon says , and he advised his parents on treatment .
Pistorius is still a patient of his .
Dr Versfeld is the surgeon who amputated Pistorius ' legs as a baby .
The reports have been submitted as evidence – the court will return to it .
The judge says she has not been able to read it yet .
In the meantime , the defence calls a new witness : Dr Gerry Versfeld , an orthopaedic surgeon .
Barry Roux , for the defence , says he would like more time to go through the report .
But he says the defence does not dispute these key findings .
A second report , says Nel , says Pistorius did not suffer from a mental defect that could have affected his actions on the night he shot Steenkamp .
Nel starts by saying the court has been handed copies of the reports .
There is a one - page report from the psychiatrists ; paragraph C says at the time of the shooting , Pistorius did not suffer from a mental disorder or defect that affected his ability to distinguish right from wrong , or to act on that .
Reeva Steenkamp 's mother , June Steenkamp , is in court , as are various members of the Pistorius family and the athlete 's coach , Ampie Louw .
State prosecutor Gerrie Nel and defence counsel Barry Roux are now in court and have gone to the judge 's chambers .
Court was due to start at 9.30am in Pretoria
but it 's unclear how long it will take the parties to go through the report , and how the trial will proceed from there .
Without knowing the report 's conclusions – and there have been no leaks to the press from the assessment – it is difficult to know how the trial will continue from here .
Kelly Phelps , a senior lecturer in the public law department at the University of Cape Town , told the Associated Press that if the panel backed the diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder , it could add weight to Pistorius 's account and compel the judge to consider the question : "" Is it more likely that he is telling the truth about what occurred on that night ? ""
Even if the judge rules that Pistorius is guilty despite any disorder that he is suffering , Phelps added , the diagnosis could be a mitigating factor when he is sentenced .
"" That is the area of law that is often referred to as diminished responsibility , "" she added .
Reporters in court are saying the psychiatric report was handed to both state and defence teams this morning .
The referral was made under section 78 of South Africa 's Criminal Procedure Act – there is a link to the full legislation here .
The key point is whether Pistorius : suffers from a mental illness or mental defect which makes him … incapable – ( a ) of appreciating the wrongfulness of his or her act or omission ; or ( b ) of acting in accordance with an appreciation of the wrongfulness of his or her act or omission .
You can watch the judge 's ruling from May here :
Delivering her ruling , Masipa said : The accused may not have raised the issue that he was not criminally responsible at the time of the incident in so many words , but evidence led on his behalf clearly raised the issue and can not be ignored .
A referral inevitably means more delays in finalising this matter but this is not about anyone 's convenience , but rather about whether justice has been served .
Nel has said that the state does not believe Pistorius has a mental illness , but advised the judge that the court must make the referral to avoid the possibility of the defence raising it in any future appeal .
The court in Pretoria resumes today in the trial of Paralympian Oscar Pistorius for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp .
Pistorius is accused of murdering his girlfriend at his home on Valentine 's Day last year .
The 27-year - old denies murder , insisting he fired his gun at a closed bathroom door after mistaking her for an intruder .
The trial has been subject to several delays , the most recent of which has seen Pistorius undergo several weeks of mental health evaluation .
He has been assessed as an outpatient over 30 days at Weskoppies psychiatric hospital in Pretoria after doubts were raised in court about his mental state at the time he shot Steenkamp .
My colleague David Smith , who will be in court in Pretoria today , reports :
﻿On Monday the trial judge , Thokozile Masipa , is expected to receive the reports of a panel of one psychologist and three psychiatrists who evaluated whether the athlete was suffering a generalised anxiety disorder that could have impaired his ability to distinguish right from wrong when he shot Steenkamp through a locked toilet door .
One of the psychiatrists , Dr Leon Fine , was hospitalised on Thursday after reportedly suffering a heart attack , but this is not expected to delay the resumption of the trial .
Once Masipa receives the conclusions from the mental health experts , it is thought the defence will call around three more witnesses , prior to closing arguments and Masipa 's deliberation on a verdict .
If , however , the experts who observed Pistorius are not unanimous in their conclusions , the judge can call them to the stand to clarify their findings .
A reminder of why Pistorius has found himself undergoing this assessment : the defence called a witness , forensic psychiatrist Dr Merryll Vorster , who said the athlete suffered from generalised anxiety disorder .
State prosecutor Gerrie Nel said this diagnosis could have affected Pistorius ' actions and argued that the court must refer him for a full mental health assessment .
The defence opposed the application by the state , pointing out that neither side was arguing that he was mentally ill when he shot Steenkamp .
But its argument was undermined by the evidence given by Vorster , who told the court that the athlete 's generalised anxiety disorder , combined with his physical vulnerability – he had both lower legs amputated as a baby – could have affected his actions .
Judge Masipa agreed , telling the court : The panel [ of mental health professionals ] will establish whether the accused was by mental illness or defect criminally responsible for his actions .
The panel will also seek to establish whether Mr Pistorius was capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act , or of acting in accordance with an appreciation of the wrongfulness of his act .
We should hear this morning what the panel has concluded on these questions .
I 'll have live coverage on this blog , and you can follow me on Twitter here , and David Smith here ."
2014-06-30,"Oscar Pistorius was not suffering from a mental illness on the night he shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp and can be held criminally responsible , a psychiatric report said on Monday .
The conclusion of a panel of mental health experts following their observation of the Paralympian was revealed at the long - awaited resumption of his "" blockbuster "" trial at the high court in Pretoria , South Africa .
Pistorius , 27 , is accused of murdering Steenkamp , a model and law graduate , after a furious argument on Valentine 's Day last year .
He denies the charge and claims he shot four times through a locked bathroom door after hearing a noise and assuming she was a burglar .
The trial , which is being followed by millions of people around the world , came to an abrupt halt in May when Pistorius was sent for psychiatric observation following an expert witness 's testimony that he suffered an anxiety disorder .
When it restarted on Monday , an evaluation that had taken 30 days at Weskoppies psychiatric hospital was disposed of in just a few minutes .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said : "" Mr Pistorius did not suffer from a mental defect or mental illness at the time of the commission of the offence that would have rendered him criminally not responsible for the offences charged . ""
He was reading from two reports prepared by a psychologist and three psychiatrists . ""
Mr Pistorius was capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act , "" Nel added .
Sitting in the dock , Pistorius , wearing a charcoal suit and white shirt , stared straight ahead as Nel briefly quoted from the reports .
His defence counsel , Barry Roux , said his team agreed with the reports but asked for more time to review them .
The findings came as no surprise to either side .
The defence had appeared taken aback when the prosecution called for Pistorius to undergo psychiatric tests after witness
Dr Merryll Vorster testified that he has a "" generalised anxiety disorder "" that could have been a factor in the killing .
It opposed the application and Pistorius himself , speaking to reporters , dismissed it as a "" joke "" .
For its part , the prosecution , which has repeatedly accused Pistorius of failing to take responsibility for his actions , is understood to have wanted any hint of an excuse about his mental state taken off the table .
In this its gambit was successful , albeit at the cost of a lengthy hiatus .
When the defence resumed on Monday – day 34 of the trial – attention switched from Pistorius 's mind to his body .
Clearly uncomfortable , the "" blade runner "" was asked to sit on a bench and remove his prosthetic limbs to allow judge Thokozile Masipa and her two legal assessors to inspect his stumps and how the skin moves on them .
The demonstration was not visible in the public gallery or on TV .
Defence witness Gerald Versfeld , an orthopaedic surgeon who amputated Pistorius 's lower legs when he was 11 months old , testified that the Olympic athlete is wobbly on his stumps and experiences "" severe pain "" when standing on them .
Pistorius was born without fibulas , the slender bones that run from below the knee to the ankle .
"" On his stumps Oscar Pistorius has serious difficulty walking or standing without support , "" Versfeld said .
"" On his stumps he is seriously vulnerable in a dangerous situation with a severely impaired ability to flee , severely impaired ability to ward off danger , without a weapon , and in danger of falling should he put the stump down incorrectly . ""
Versfeld also read out a statement from Pistorius that said : "" The dog can knock me over , in fact the dog has knocked me over many times .
"" The defence argues that Pistorius could not have smashed down the toilet door with a cricket bat while on his stumps , as the prosecution claims , when trying to reach Steenkamp moments after shooting her .
During cross - examination , Nel suggested that Pistorius had overstated his immobility and that he had in fact moved around on his stumps , carrying a pistol without falling , before and after Steenkamp 's death .
The defence next called Ivan Lin , an engineer and acoustics expert , to testify if Pistorius 's neighbours could have differentiated between a man and a woman screaming .
Earlier in the trial , state witnesses said they heard a woman 's "" bloodcurdling screams "" the night Pistorius shot Steenkamp .
The defence contends that Pistorius sounds like a woman when he screams . ""
Although typically one can differentiate a male and female scream , one can not say it reliably without exception , "" Lin told the court .
He cast doubt on the state witnesses who lived 177 metres from Pistorius and testified that they heard a woman screaming .
Lin said it is "" very unlikely "" that people living at such a distance from the house could "" hear the screams let alone interpret the sound source reliably "" .
It is thought the defence will call one or two more witnesses before resting its case .
Both sides will then require a few more weeks to compile their written submissions before presenting them to the court .
They will return to court to answer final questions on their arguments .
South Africa does not have jury trials , so a verdict will be delivered by the judge .
Pistorius faces a maximum of 25 years in prison if convicted of murder ."
2014-07-01,
2014-07-01,"The court has adjourned early today to allow state prosecutor Gerrie Nel time to prepare further questions for his cross - examination of Pistorius ' manager , Peet van Zyl , who will continue in the witness box on Wednesday morning .
Here 's what the court heard today :
• Van Zyl told the court that when planning Pistorius ' competitions for 2013 , the athlete had asked that event organisers arrange for Reeva Steenkamp to accompany him on two of the trips .
He had never asked this of any other girlfriend .
Van Zyl said Pistorius wanted Steenkamp to "" see what my world is about "" .
•
Nel cited a report that a room - mate of Pistorius at the London 2012 Paralympic games asked to move because the athlete was constantly on the phone arguing .
Van Zyl said he had seen Pistorius lose his temper only twice , in the face of "" abusive "" questioning from journalists .
•
Pistorius was due to retire from athletics in 2017 , his manager said .
But his financial position was very strong after his performance in London in 2012 .
•
Van Zyl said Pistorius was very vigilant and concerned for his personal safety .
Under cross - examination , he told the court he had seen the athlete carrying a firearm in the months before Steenkamp was killed .
Pistorius was also known to drive at "" breakneck "" speeds , the court heard .
•
Earlier , in cross - examination , defence acoustics expert
Ivan Lin told the court that he did not think neighbours who testified to hearing a woman 's screams were lying .
But he said it was not possible to conclude that it could not have been a man 's voice .
•
After the court adjourned , there were as - yet unconfirmed reports that the psychiatric evaluation presented to the judge yesterday did not support the diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder .
The court will reconvene on Wednesday morning .
Thanks for reading the live blog .
A potentially crucial development here : It was a witness for the defence , Dr Merryll Vorster , who told the court she had diagnosed the athlete with generalised anxiety disorder – evidence that prompted the 30-day psychiatric assessment that yesterday concluded Pistorius was not mentally ill when he shot Reeva Steenkamp .
Vorster , a forensic psychiatrist , had told the court she did not believe Pistorius was incapable of telling right from wrong .
But she did express doubt over his ability to act in accordance with his understanding of right and wrong .
On Monday , Gerrie Nel read from the report compiled by specialists at Weskoppies psychiatric hospital following their observations :
Mr Pistorius did not suffer from a mental defect or mental illness at the time of the commission of the offence that would have rendered him criminally not responsible for the offences charged .
Mr Pistorius was capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act .
It is possible that the defence – which did not argue that Pistorius was not criminally responsible for the shooting – intends to use the GAD diagnosis to argue for a reduced sentence if he is convicted of murder﻿. Some interesting background from South African journalist and radio presenter David O'Sullivan on why Pistorius ' room - mate in London in 2012 moved out of their shared accommodation .
The full article is here .
And here 's the relevant section :
﻿At
the London Games , I was chatting to Oscar ’s roommate in the Athletes’ Village , Arnu Fourie , who had just won the bronze medal in the 100 m , edging his good friend Oscar out of the medals .
Oscar was genuinely elated at his mate ’s success .
They were obviously very close and I asked Fourie what it was like rooming with Oscar .
He told me he had been forced to move out , because Oscar was constantly screaming in anger at people on the phone .
I thought Fourie was joking and waited for him to smile .
But he was serious .
I was taken aback .
I had never thought of Oscar behaving like that .
And in this Guardian article before Pistorius and Fourie faced each other in the T44 200 m final , Pistorius joked : It is going to be a bit awkward the night before the final .
I might have to drop some sleeping pills in his water .
Nel says he needs more time to prepare further questions for Van Zyl ; he did not expect to hear from this witness today .
The court breaks for the day .
I will post a summary soon .
Nel admits he is leaping about in his questioning : he turns to Van Zyl 's line that Pistorius wanted Steenkamp to "" see what his life was about "" .
Van Zyl says Pistorius never asked him to arrange for previous girlfriends to travel with him .
Did you think Pistorius was paranoid , Nel asks .
Van Zyl says he 's not qualified to give an opinion on that .
I agree with you , says Nel –
you 're not qualified .
( Van Zyl earlier told the court he thought the athlete had a "" heightened sense of awareness "" . )
Nel goes through some of the examples Van Zyl gave earlier .
It 's normal to worry after a hijacking , is n't it , he asks .
And to sit with a good view in a restaurant ?
Van Zyl : For me it was always interesting that Mr Pistorius wanted to be positioned in such a way that he could see what was happening .
Van Zyl says he first learnt of Pistorius ' love for guns in late 2012 .
He first saw him carrying a firearm in November 2012 .
Pistorius said he was carrying it because he feared for his personal safety .
Nel asks about an article by a British journalist in which Pistorius said he would go to the shooting range at night if he could n't sleep .
Van Zyl says he read it .
Here is the article in question ( it 's actually from the New York Times ) : ﻿He fetched his 9-millimeter handgun and two boxes of ammunition .
We got back in the car and drove to a nearby firing range , where he instructed me on proper technique .
Pistorius was a good coach .
A couple of my shots got close to the bull’s - eye , which delighted him .
“
Maybe you should do this more , ” he said .
“
If you practiced , I think you could be pretty deadly .
”
I asked him how often he came to the range .
“ Just sometimes when I ca n’t sleep , ” he said .
Nel turns to 14 February 2013 , the night Steenkamp was shot .
Has Van Zyl discussed the incident with Pistorius ?
Not once , says Van Zyl .
I shared with him my condolences and feelings about what had happened .
Van Zyl says he was told there were issues between the two athletes .
He does not know what was the problem .
Nel tells Van Zyl : "" I am not going to go away . ""
He asks the question again .
Nel asks the question again : why did the room - mate not want to stay with Pistorius ?
Van Zyl insists he was never given a specific reason , and did not discuss it with Pistorius .
It was dealt with in London , he repeats .
Nel mentions a report that a competition roommate of Oscar Pistorius asked to move because the athlete was constantly on the phone arguing .
Van Zyl says he ca n't comment on the reasons .
Nel :
Do you know why he wanted to leave?﻿ Van Zyl : What I heard was this person wanted to leave the room because of problems he had with Oscar .
Nel :
Why did he want to leave the room ?
It 's such an easy question
…
Now I 'm worried .
Why is it so difficult for you to say negative things about Oscar ?
Van Zyl : I was n't in London .
I only received a phone call to say there was a problem .
It was dealt with within the team environment .
[ Update : here is the report to which Nel appears to be referring .
The room - mate was Arnu Fourie . ]
Van Zyl says he was introduced to two other girlfriends of Pistorius in the seven years they worked together .
Nel says Pistorius took one of them – Samantha Taylor – on an overseas trip for a TV programme .
Van Zyl says this was not a professional trip .
He says Pistorius did not discuss his relationship with Taylor .
He did not attend any events with the couple .
Pistorius always played within the rules , Van Zyl says .
He used the same legs in every race so he would not be accused of gaining an advantage .
This was not the case for Oliviera , he says : Nel says Van Zyl forgot an incident in which he called Oliviera – who beat him in the Paralympic 200 m final – a cheat .
The manager says he did n't forget it ; he was n't there .
It was delegated to media people in London .
A reminder – Pistorius said in 2012 :
Not taking away from Alan 's performance , he 's a great athlete , but these guys are a lot taller and you ca n't compete [ with the ] stride length .
You saw how far he came back .
We are n't racing a fair race .
I gave it my best.﻿ Press interviews referred to the "" breakneck "" speeds , Nel says .
Van Zyl says he did n't read all the articles .
Nel says he will show them to him – "" so relax ! ""
Van Zyl says he has heard reports that Pistorius drove at high speed ; he was not witness to those apart from the incident he told the court earlier .
But other athletes had also mentioned it to him .
He did not discuss this with Pistorius as he did n't deem it to be reckless .
Nobody ever complained about it , Van Zyl says .
Gerrie Nel is on his feet .
He says he was not expecting this character evidence from Van Zyl today .
He will ask some questions now then request a postponement to tomorrow to prepare fully .
But he begins with some questions to Pistorius ' manager , Peet Van Zyl , on the athlete 's tendency to drive at high speed .
Roux has finished his questions for Van Zyl .
The court breaks for tea .
Pistorius , sitting in the dock , has his head in his hand .
Van Zyl says he told Steenkamp she would be going to Brazil –
she was "" very excited , ecstatic "" , he says .
Van Zyl says Pistorius would retire in 2017 .
He was "" a very astute businessman "" and was engaged in setting up "" brand ambassadorships "" to make him financially secure post - retirement .
Van Zyl : I think people would agree with me that the London Olympic games was about two people :
Usain Bolt and Oscar Pistorius.﻿ Lots of offers came the athlete 's way after the games , Van Zyl says .
Van Zyl reads from correspondence with an event organiser to finalise conditions for Pistorius to compete in Manchester .
He asked for an additional business - class ticket for Steenkamp to join Pistorius on the trip .
Pistorius was also due to compete in Brazil in March last year – it would be the first meeting between Pistorius and Brazilian sprinter Alan Oliveira , who beat him ( to Pistorius ' anger ) at the London Olympics in 2012 .
Steenkamp was also due to accompany him to Brazil .
Van Zyl says he met Reeva Steenkamp on a number of occasions .
It was a loving relationship ; they used lots of pet names for each other .
He says that in planning Pistorius ' competition for 2013 , the athlete had asked for him to arrange with event organisers for Steenkamp to accompany him on two of the trips .
He had never asked this of any other girlfriend .
He says Pistorius told him he wanted Steenkamp to "" see what my world is about "" .
One instance , says Van Zyl , was in 2009 when a camera was stuck in his face in an airport in Barcelona and a journalist called him a "" cheat "" for attempting to race against able - bodied athletes .
The other instance was during a BBC radio interview , in which Pistorius left the studio with his manager after what Van Zyl says was a question about whether he was an embarrassment to his country for wanting to compete in the Olympics .
Van Zyl says he lost his own temper more often .
The anger was usually in response to "" abusive "" questions from the media , he says .
Van Zyl says Pistorius always kept his prosthetic legs on .
On one occasion on a plane , he removed them as he had blisters , and fell asleep .
One of the legs fell into the aisle , was picked up by cabin crew , and Pistorius reacted quickly –
it was clear he did n't want anyone to see his stumps , Van Zyl says .
Pistorius ' manager continues to list incidents in which the athlete showed a sense of fear and insecurity : Van Zyl says it was "" a bit annoying "" that he could not get Pistorius to focus ; he was always looking around and "" fidgeting "" .
In a restaurant he would always sit where he could see any exits and entrances .
Van Zyl recounts another incident when the two men were walking in New York
, they heard a loud bang , Pistorius grabbed his arm in fear .
It was strange for me that he would react in such a way that he would grab me when something happened .
Barry Roux says he and Van Zyl have discussed Pistorius ' "" vigilance "" .
Van Zyl : For me the best way to describe it is a heightened sense of awareness .
He says the athlete drove fast because of a fear of car - jacking ( Van Zyl was hijacked in 2007 ) and being followed .
Pistorius would always park in open space , well lit , to be secure .
Van Zyl says he is Pistorius ' manager , or agent .
Officially he is an "" athlete 's representative "" .
He first met Pistorius in 2004 but began working with him in 2006 .
Pistorius ' manager , Peet van Zyl , will be the next witness for the defence .
This video is of Van Zyl speaking to the media after visiting Pistorius in prison last year .
Roux asks for a three - minute break to check with his next witness .
Roux asks about the new houses on the estate .
Lin says he did not take them into account in his calculations .
They would have made the sound lower .
This witness has now finished his evidence and is excused .
The cross - examination is finished .
Roux is up for the re - examination of Lin .
He asks him to measure the ambient sound of the courtroom again .
Lin says it is between 40db and 41db .
You 're not saying the witnesses who told us they heard a woman scream are lying , Nel asks Lin .
Lin : ﻿We're talking about a possible scenario from a scientific perspective .
I 'm not saying the witnesses are lying at all .
Nel :
It 's possible , you 're not excluding , the fact that somebody at 177 m , in the bedroom , would have heard the noise ?
Lin :
No .
Gerrie Nel turns to the neighbour 80 m away who testified to hearing a woman scream .
The sound would be intelligible , the report says .
That means the listener could tell the difference between a man and a woman , Nel infers .
That 's not what I said , Lin tells him .
Nel asks for a 10-minute adjournment ; he will have more questions for Lin after the break .
The judge agrees .
Court breaks for 10 minutes .
The report does not make a finding on the ability of listeners to distinguish between a male and female voice over the relevant distance , Nel asks ?
That 's correct , says Lin .
Nel says he understands that not all women sound the same , not all men sound the same .
There are exceptions .
But there are no exceptions among the witnesses .
They all said they heard a woman scream .
Defence counsel Barry Roux objects .
Nel is referring to only the four witnesses called by the state , he says , not "" all "" witnesses .
Lin says he is sure those four people heard a sound .
It 's not for him to intepret what they heard .
Nel asks what Lin means by his assessment of sounds as "" intelligible "" .
Judge Masipa says she is also unsure .
Lin says it is about the ability of the listener to perceive information and interpret the sound .
This is highly variable , he says .
Nel points out that the court does not know about the witnesses ' powers of hearing and perception .
The prosecutor turns to factors that could have affected how the sound travelled : the properties of a glass window ; if a window did not seal properly .
How much sound would be lost ?
He quibbles with Lin 's model .
Nel reminds the court – with pictures this time – that new houses have been built since the night Steenkamp was killed .
He says there was a direct line of sight from the bedroom of Burger and her husband Charl Johnson to Pistorius ' home .
Nel finally moves on .
The court is shown some images of the view of Pistorius ' house from the balcony of Michelle Burger 's house .
Here 's a grab of what the court is seeing :
Nel persists : if Lin had applied the 5db of the standards , and an extra 10db for the "" high end "" of the scream , it would have affected his findings significantly .
Even if you do that , Lin says , you have a sound level quieter than the ambient volume in the courtroom ( they are talking about how audible the scream would have been at the 177 m distance ) .
The exchanges are becoming more testy : Nel is not willing to let this one go .
He says this 5db difference would have made Steenkamp 's screams more audible .
Lin is unwavering : this is not the correct context .
Nel quotes the South African national standard on the measurement and rating of environmental noise .
He says these standards say a noise of tonal character would add 5db .
Lin says the standards deal with sound pollution ; they are not applicable here .
He says they are used to identify ongoing noise such as a mechanical plant , annoying noises that continue over a period of time .
The standards are designed for a specific purpose , not for what is being discussed here .
He does not believe they apply in this context .
Nel turns back to the screams .
A woman 's scream would have a particular tonal character , he says , "" almost like a musical note "" .
Lin agrees that it is a common perception that a woman 's voice and scream is higher than that of a man .
How loud would the firearm have been in that bathroom , Nel asks – 160db ?
Lin says he has no idea .
Nel says his own expert says 160db – would Lin say he is wrong ?
Lin says he was asked only to consider the question of the scream .
Nel :
You 're the expert and I 'm trying to get as much out of you as I can , and I 'm entitled to do that .
The tiles in the bathroom would amplify the sound of the scream , Nel argues .
Lin says the energy of the scream can not be increased ; the tiles do not make it louder .
Nel says that if Reeva Steenkamp had been screaming in fear of her life , would n't she have been louder than the levels Lin tested ?
Nel suggests her volume would have been closer to 120 decibels than the 110 decibels in the testing .
Lin sounds sceptical but concedes it is possible .
Nel says the 10db difference could alter some of the scenarios in Lin 's report .
Nel says it is "" common sense "" that more often than not it is possible to distinguish a male from a female voice , though not absolutely certain .
Lin agrees .
Nel turns to Lin 's report and conclusions about the difficulties of telling the difference between a male and a female scream .
Lin : One can not be absolutely certain , reliably certain .
Nel :
Do n't we do that everyday ?
We hear male voices , female voices … often we are able to identify that.﻿
Nel says that if we say we hear a woman screaming , "" more often than not , we are right "" .
Lin confirms that Pistorius ' attorney Brian Webber supplied him with some of the information for the reconstructions .
Nel asks if Lin was told that a neighbour 's window ( from the distance he cites –
177 m –
I suspect he means the Burgers ) was "" wide open "" .
That information was not available , Lin says .
Lin confirms he never had access to the neighbours ' houses , but saw photographs of homes of witnesses 80 m and 177 m away .
He did go to Pistorius ' house .
Lin confirms to Nel that he completed his report at the end of last week .
He begins to run through the different scenarios he recreated : screams from the locked toilet , bathroom , balcony and bedroom , and how well they could be heard and interpreted ( "" audible and intelligible "" ) from neighbours ' bedrooms and balconies .
Nel points out that there have been developments – new houses – on the estate since the night of the shooting .
That could affect the acoustics , he suggests .
Nel : When you went to the scene last week , it was more than a year after the incident :
trees have grown , new houses built …
Lin : I inquired about that … I was informed there were new houses built in - between .
Trees growing is a "" natural assumption "" , Lin tells the court.﻿ We start with Nel 's cross - examination of acoustics expert Ivan Lin .
Nel reminds the court of Lin ’s finding that the modelling process excludes the possibility of a 100 % reproduction of the sound source .
The results of the 30-day psychiatric evaluation were dealt with surprisingly quickly in court on Monday .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel read from two reports prepared by a psychologist and three psychiatrists : Mr Pistorius did not suffer from a mental defect or mental illness at the time of the commission of the offence that would have rendered him criminally not responsible for the offences charged .
Mr Pistorius was capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act .
As my colleague David Smith reports , the results were not unexpected : The findings came as no surprise to either side .
The defence had appeared taken aback when the prosecution called for Pistorius to undergo psychiatric tests after witness
Dr Merryll Vorster testified that he has a ' generalised anxiety disorder ' that could have been a factor in the killing .
It opposed the application and Pistorius himself , speaking to reporters , dismissed it as a ' joke ' .
For its part , the prosecution , which has repeatedly accused Pistorius of failing to take responsibility for his actions , is understood to have wanted any hint of an excuse about his mental state taken off the table .
In this its gambit was successful , albeit at the cost of a lengthy hiatus.﻿ The court is due to resume shortly in the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine 's day last year .
Pistorius denies the premeditated murder of his girlfriend at his home in Pretoria , saying he shot her after mistaking her for an intruder in the middle of the night .
The court reconvened on Monday after a lengthy break during which Pistorius underwent a 30-day psychiatric evaluation .
Although the full report has not yet been aired in court , both state and defence counsel agreed with the main findings of the panel of psychiatrists : that Pistorius was not suffering from a mental disorder when he shot Steenkamp , and he was capable of distinguishing right from wrong .
The court on Monday also heard : • Defence acoustics expert
Ivan Lin said screams from the locked toilet in Pistorius ' house were ' unlikely ' to be heard in neighbours ' bedrooms 177 m away , contradicting testimony from a state witness who said she heard a woman 's "" blood - curdling "" cries on the night Steenkamp was killed .
Lin said it was not always possible to tell whether a scream was made by a man or a woman ; the defence claims that neighbours who say they heard a woman 's cries in fact heard a distressed Pistorius calling for help .
Lin is due to be cross - examined by state prosecutor Gerrie Nel today .
•
The surgeon who amputated Pistorius ' legs as a baby said the athlete would be "" severely impaired "" in a dangerous situation , and would be unable to flee if on his stumps .
He said Pistorius lacked proprioception and would have needed to hold on to something for balance if moving around in the dark .
•
Judge Thokozile Masipa has said she is "" very unhappy "" at the state 's failure to produce an electrical cord that was in Pistorius ' bedroom on the night of the shooting .
The cord appeared in police photographs but was not listed on an inventory of items removed from the house .
The defence says its disappearance compromises the case because the cord was raised by Nel in cross - examination of Pistorius .
Masipa ordered the officer in charge of securing the house to account for what happened .
My colleague David Smith is in court in Pretoria ; you can follow him on Twitter here , and me here .
Monday 's live blog is here , with a summary of that day 's key developments here .
Monday 's report is here ."
2014-07-01,"Oscar Pistorius 's fall from grace – and the financial opportunities he lost when he shot and killed Reeva Steenkamp – were laid bare at the high court in Pretoria on Tuesday .
The athlete 's achievements on the track have only occasionally featured in his trial for the murder of his girlfriend , but the arrival of his manager on the witness stand offered a stark reminder of all he has lost . ""
Due to the amazing performances of Mr Pistorius in London at the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games , his profile was raised to global icon , sports icon status , and I think all media would agree with me that the London Olympic Games was about two people , and that was Mr Usain Bolt and Mr Oscar Pistorius , "" said Peet van Zyl , giving evidence for the defence .
Pistorius became the first amputee sprinter to compete in an Olympic Games , finishing second in a 400 m heat .
The roar that greeted him when he was introduced to the crowd in London was said to rival that for any British athlete .
Less than two years later , Pistorius , 27 , is standing trial for Steenkamp 's murder .
He denies the charge , insisting that he panicked and opened fire after thinking he heard an intruder at his home in Pretoria .
The four shots he fired through a locked toilet door brought his career to a dramatic halt and cost him millions in lost sponsorships from Nike , Oakley and others .
He has been forced to sell his house to keep up with legal fees .
Van Zyl , clean cut in a grey suit and purple tie , described the value of "" Brand Pistorius "" before it was irredeemably soiled .
He said he first met Pistorius in 2004 after the Paralympics in Athens and they began working together in 2006 .
He would secure competitions and races for Pistorius , negotiate and acquire sponsorship deals and manage his financial affairs .
The pair were in contact almost daily , he said .
The defence counsel Barry Roux asked what Pistorius 's financial prospects were in February 2013 , the month that Steenkamp died .
Van Zyl replied : "" Based on the profile that Mr Pistorius 's image carried in the business world , a lot of opportunities came our way where corporate companies wanted to be associated with Mr Pistorius due to the synergy between their values and his values , and they would want to build marketing and advertising campaigns based on that .
"" The financial implications were going to be substantial .
I can easily say five , six times more than what it was before the London Olympic Games . ""
Van Zyl told the court that Pistorius had intended to announce his retirement in 2017 , a year after the Olympics and Paralympics in Rio , Brazil .
"" Some of the current sponsors we were still busy in negotiation with , where not only would Mr Pistorius have brand ambassadorial roles until his retirement but also post - retirement for the work and effort that he 's put in for these brands .
"" Some of the companies were to offer Pistorius share options and royalties from sales of product and merchandise carrying his brand , Van Zyl said .
In what appeared to be an attempt to show that Pistorius understood how much he had to lose , and therefore was unlikely to commit murder , Roux asked whether the athlete had been aware of this "" bright financial future "" in February 2013 .
Van Zyl replied : "" Mr Pistorius , I can also confirm , is a very astute businessman and he was very aware of the role that he had to play within his brand and the financial implications that he stood to gain in the years to come . ""
Earlier , Roux asked the manager about Pistorius 's relationship with Steenkamp . ""
For me I would describe it as a loving and caring relationship , "" he said .
"" Mr Pistorius and Miss Steenkamp were always calling each other pet names . ""
Van Zyl told how on the eve of the shooting Pistorius was making plans to take Steenkamp to two of his athletics meetings , in Manchester and Brazil , so she could understand "" what my world is really about "" and why he faced pressures that meant he could not always accompany her to social events .
The manager said he suggested a romantic trip to Tuscany , Italy , in July 2013 to hear the Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli in concert .
"" I specifically said to Mr Pistorius , well if you want to take Miss Steenkamp to these competitions , why do n't you really impress her by taking her to an Andrea Bocelli concert ?
And he was very excited about it and asked me to look into it and try to find more information . ""
The prosecution has sought to portray Pistorius as a gun obsessive who is quick to anger , but Van Zyl claimed he could recall only two incidents when the sprinter had lost his temper .
Both concerned journalists ' questions about the debate over whether his prosthetic limbs gave him an unfair advantage .
"" As we came through arrival hall , a camera crew stuck a camera in Mr Pistorius 's face and called him a cheat that he wanted to compete against able - bodied athletes , "" he recalled of a 2009 encounter at Barcelona airport .
The second occurred at the BBC studios in London during an interview before the 2012 Olympics . ""
The tone of the questions and everything was leading up the eventual question that was put to Mr Pistorius :
do n't you think that he 's an embarrassment for his country for trying to compete in the Olympic Games ?
Whereupon myself also called Mr Pistorius out of the studio , and both Mr Pistorius and myself left the studio .
"" Those were the two occasions that I can honestly say he lost his temper and showed his disappointment with it . ""
Van Zyl , whose appearance as a character witness took the prosecutor Gerrie Nel by surprise , also described Pistorius as having a "" heightened sense of awareness "" and being fearful of crime but rarely aggressive .
"" I asked him why he was carrying a gun ; he specifically replied to me he 's carrying a gun because he 's fearing for his own safety , "" Van Zyl said .
The case continues ."
2014-07-02,"Oscar Pistorius is a potential suicide risk , a psychological evaluation has found , but full details of the report can not be made public because of a court banning order .
The Paralympian , who is standing trial for the murder of his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , has post - traumatic stress disorder and a major depressive disorder , the clinical psychologist Jonathan Scholtz 's report concludes .
The danger of Pistorius killing himself is discussed in the main body of the report , copies of which are in the possession of the Guardian and other media organisations but which can not be published due to an intervention by the judge , Thokozile Masipa , a former journalist .
Her order came at the end of the day following a request from the defence to protect the privacy of Pistorius and his family .
But by then details of the report had already appeared on social media , creating a legal minefield .
Pistorius is accused of killing Steenkamp , a model and law graduate , after an argument at his home on Valentine 's Day last year .
He claims he shot her by accident after mistaking her for a burglar .
The forensic psychological report was produced after Pistorius underwent 30 days of mental - health evaluation at Weskoppies hospital .
Its conclusions , which remain in the public domain , were read out in court by the defence counsel Barry Roux . ""
Mr Pistorius has been severely traumatised by the events that took place on 14 February 2013 , "" the report says .
"" He currently suffers from a post - traumatic stress disorder , and a major depressive disorder â€ ¦ The degree of anxiety and depression that is present is significant .
He is also mourning the loss of Ms Steenkamp . ""
Mr Pistorius is being treated and should continue to receive clinical care by a psychiatrist and a clinical psychologist for his current condition .
Should he not receive proper clinical care , his condition is likely to worsen and increase the risk for suicide . ""
At times during his high - profile trial at the high court in Pretoria , Pistorius has variously cried out , sobbed hysterically and vomited â€ “ particularly during graphic testimony about the fatal injuries sustained by Steenkamp .
At other times he has looked calm and taken notes .
The prosecution has sought to portray him as short - tempered and trigger - happy , but the assessment states : "" No evidence could be found to indicate that Mr Pistorius has a history of abnormal aggression or explosive violence â€
¦
He does not display the personality characteristics of narcissism and or psychopathy that are mostly associated with men in abusive relationships and have been linked to rage - type murders in intimate relationships . ""
It says Pistorius has a history of feeling insecure and vulnerable , especially when he is without his prosthetic limbs .
He has been exposed to crime directly and indirectly throughout his life . ""
When Mr Pistorius 's appraisal of the situation is that he might be physically threatened , a fear response follows that might seem extraordinary when viewed from the perspective of a normal - bodied person , but normal in the context of a disabled person with his history . ""
The report rejects the assertion of an expert witness that Pistorius was suffering a generalised anxiety disorder on the night he shot four times through a locked toilet door , killing 29-year - old Steenkamp . ""
No evidence could be found to indicate that Mr Pistorius suffered from anxiety to the extent that it impaired his functioning prior to the incident in February 2013 .
"" Scholtz also considered the athlete 's feelings towards Steenkamp . ""
There is evidence to indicate that Mr Pistorius was genuine with his feelings towards Miss Steenkamp and that they had a normal loving relationship .
He did become insecure and jealous at times but this was normal for the specific situation . ""
He would express his displeasure and irritation but would try and sort it out later by talking with Miss Steenkamp .
Although the relationship was still young , there were no signs of abusive coercion like those often found in these kinds of relationships .
"" Journalists were given a copy of the report on request and one South African journalist could be seen tweeting excerpts from it over lunch .
But when Pistorius returned to court and learned of the distribution , he objected , telling Roux the report was private .
At the end of the day 's proceedings , the defence requested that all but the conclusions be censored .
Masipa , looking uncomfortable , said : "" They 're already out there in the public .
I can only prohibit something which has not happened yet , so would have to say ' as from this moment
â€ ¦ ' .
I wish someone had alerted me to this earlier . ""
With no objection from the prosecution , she ruled : "" From this moment , that will be contempt of court .
What has been published before 15:05 , we ca n't do anything about .
But as from this moment , publication of the content of these reports is prohibited .
"" The decision prompted criticism on social media and accusations of bias in the celebrity 's favour .
William Booth , a lawyer and media commentator , said such bans were understandable in cases involving children or where state security could be compromised , but protection of family privacy was "" not a sufficient reason "" .
He added : "" So much has been presented to court in detail about the relationship between Oscar and Reeva , and his state of mind , that I 'm a little bit surprised the report ca n't be published .
So much has come out , I do n't believe you can really exclude all the contents of the report which might be very relevant to the case . ""
A separate report on Pistorius 's mental health , compiled by a panel of three psychiatrists , came to similar conclusions .
The case continues , with evidence for the defence expected to conclude on Friday ."

2014-07-04,"This is the house that Oscar Pistorius bought for 9 m rand ( £ 488,000 ) because , he claims , he and his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp had agreed to move in together .
The luxury property is located in Atholl in the wealthy suburb of Sandton , Johannesburg .
The Paralympian paid a deposit on the house in December 2012 but the deal was cancelled after he was arrested for the fatal shooting of Steenkamp two months later .
Pistorius , 27 , is standing trial for murder at the high court in Pretoria , the capital of South Africa .
The prosecution claims that he killed Steenkamp during a furious argument .
He maintains that they were in love and he shot her in a tragic accident after mistaking her for a burglar .
The strength of the couple 's relationship has been under scrutiny in court .
According to the house owner who sold to Pistorius , they looked at ease in each other 's company and apparently ready to live together .
"" They were looking at the house together at that time , "" recalled the man , who gave his name only as Ricardo , a property developer in his 40s .
"" I think they were both moving in .
They seemed fine ; they were quite happy .
"" It was a whirlwind romance : Pistorius had only met the model and law graduate through mutual friends on 4 November 2012 .
He was living in Pretoria at the time but says he planned to sell his house there and move to nearby Johannesburg , where Steenkamp was staying with friends and had regular meetings and fashion shoots .
A friend of the athlete said Pistorius was concerned about her safety driving back and forth between the two cities . ""
He trained in Pretoria but could do his gym workouts in Johannesburg , "" the friend said .
"" They had talked about moving in together and were really excited about it . ""
The two - storey house he chose is on the corner of a tree - lined avenue and shielded by high walls , electric fences and landscaped gardens .
Behind the high , brushed metal automatic gates is an entrance of concrete and mirrored glass .
According to the local estate agency Firzt , the property has four ensuite bedrooms , a large dining room , family room , study , breakfast room , outside patio , four garages , a lap pool , another patio with a barbecue area and a big garden .
The house is about four years old , spanning about 750 sq metres on 2,000 sq metres of land .
Pistorius , whose fear of crime has been a recurring theme in court , was said to have been making arrangements for "" state - of - the - art security "" at his new home .
Ricardo , who recently sold the house for the same price of about 9 m rand , added : "" He seemed like a nice guy .
He did n't say why he was buying the house .
He just wanted to move to Sandton .
Everything seemed fine at the time of the negotiations .
When I heard the whole situation , I was shocked . ""
After the shooting on 14 February 2013 , Pistorius was arrested and charged with murder and the deal was swiftly cancelled .
A source close to the athlete said it had been a struggle to get a refund on the commission Pistorius had paid the estate agent .
In April , during his trial , Pistorius told the court : "" In December 2012 I 'd been to look at a property in Johannesburg .
My relationship with Reeva –
I was kind of taken aback by her and just bowled over by how much I fell for her , so I thought about buying a house in Johannesburg and I had been for some time . ""
So I was looking at properties and
I went to look at a house in Johannesburg in December 2012
and I liked it , and I placed an offer to purchase the house which was accepted , and I realised I 'd need to fix up certain things on my home in Pretoria before I could sell it . ""
The court has also viewed Whatsapp messages between the couple .
On 23 January , Steenkamp wrote to Pistorius : "" It will be just fine .
It 's a lot of money but that 's just it .
Money .
It 's a beautiful house that you will make ( ? ) little home .
And if u ca n't pay for it anymore one day and I ca n't help you either then we run away to the eastern country and live in exile from the banks .
Ill bake to make money and ill still look after u ok .
"" That 's the worst thing that can happen here .
The best thing that will happen is that you will get your house and live happily ever after .
Do n't let the formalities in between confuse you . """
2014-07-06,"Oscar Pistorius 's family have condemned "" a staggering breach of trust "" after the broadcast of a secret video that shows the Paralympian re - enacting the night he shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp .
The footage , leaked to Australian television , shows Pistorius running awkwardly without his prosthetic limbs , his right arm outstretched pretending to hold a gun .
Two men in shirts and ties watch with their hands in their pockets .
In another sequence the athlete , wearing a blue Nike vest and black Lycra shorts , can be seen struggling on all fours to drag a motionless woman out of a small toilet cubicle similar to the one in his home .
He is also seen with his prosthetics on , carrying the woman down a staircase .
The 27-year - old is on trial for the murder of Steenkamp , 29 , a model and law graduate .
He denies the charge , insisting that he mistook her for a burglar .
Pistorius can reportedly be heard on the soundtrack of the video simulating the warning he gave the perceived intruder : "" I 'll call the police , get out , get out !
Get the fuck out ! ""
He can then be heard screaming hysterically as he recreates the moment he realised it was Steenkamp he had shot .
Pistorius appears emotionless during the reconstruction .
According to Australia 's Channel Seven , the part of Steenkamp was played by his sister , Aimee , and the video was filmed at the home of his uncle , Arnold , where he has been staying since the tragedy .
A promotional video for the Channel Seven programme Sunday Night described "" never before seen footage of Oscar Pistorius re - enacting the night he killed Reeva that convinced a top forensic expert he is innocent "" .
The video aired in Australia on Sunday was billed as a "" world exclusive "" .
Pistorius 's defence team accused Channel Seven of obtaining the footage illegally .
They said it had been shot for an American company , The Evidence Room , which specialises in forensic animations of crime scenes .
The company had been hired to visually map the events on the night of the killing . ""
The ' visual mapping ' was for trial preparation only and was not intended to be used for any other purpose , "" said Brian Webber , who has been part of Pistorius 's defence team at the high court in Pretoria .
"" It has now emerged that an Australian broadcaster has obtained some of this footage from The Evidence Room and has just gone to air with it .
We wish to make it very clear that the material that has been aired was obtained illegally and in breach of the non - disclosure agreement with The Evidence Room . ""
Webber added : "" For the family , the airing of this footage constitutes a staggering breach of trust and an invasion of the family 's privacy .
It has come to our attention that Channel Seven purchased this footage unlawfully .
In addition , during our engagement with Channel Seven , we received an undertaking that they would not air any of the material before the end of the trial . ""
The defence team does not believe the content of the video will harm Pistorius 's case .
Webber concluded : "" Whilst we can not imagine how any of the footage would not support Oscar 's version , we will only be in a position to comment further once we have had the opportunity to study what has been aired . ""
A report on Channel Seven 's website says the footage convinced leading US forensic investigator Scott Roder that Pistorius 's story was true . ""
Absolutely , the physical evidence is consistent and his story remains unchanged , "" Roder told the Sunday Night programme .
"" If you look at the evidence , Oscar 's clearly not guilty . ""
The trial resumes on Monday ."
2014-07-07,"An update : South African media reports that the prosecution team , including lead advocate Gerrie Nel , has not seen the footage of Pistorius re - enacting his version of events on the night Steenkamp was killed , which was aired on Australian television at the weekend .
The National Prosecution Authorityâ€ ™ s
spokesman Nathi Mncube told media they had not watched the video .
Earlier today , Nel asked witness Professor Wayne Derman if Pistorius could walk backwards on his stumps , which many observers took to be a reference to the video , in which the athlete does just that .
The South African Press Association quotes Mncube saying : We have no comment â€ ¦ and have nothing to do with the video .
A truncated day in court , but with an assurance from Barry Roux , lead counsel for the defence , that he is on the verge of wrapping up his case .
If he does so on Tuesday morning , we could then see a date set for all parties to return to court for closing arguments .
That could be another four to six weeks away .
On Monday , the court heard : â€¢ Professor Wayne Derman , chief medical officer of the South African Paralympic team at the 2012 London Olympics , told the court that Pistorius had the intention to shoot when he approached the bathroom of his home on the night of 14 February 2013 .
State prosecutor Gerrie Nel told him : With intention to kill , he shot the person behind the door .
That 's what he wanted to do , and that 's what he did .
â€¢ Nel also quizzed Derman about Pistorius ' mobility when on his stumps â€ “ but a video showing the athlete re - enacting his version of how he shot Steenkamp then carried her from the bathroom was not mentioned in court .
The Australian TV channel that aired the footage insisted it did not believe it was obtained illegally .
â€¢ Derman rebuffed claims by Nel that he was a biased witness and unable to act objectively in this case because he was too close to Pistorius , having treated him over many years .
The doctor told the court : He is not a family member .
He is one of a team of individuals I have travelled with â€ ¦
I believe I can be objective with respect to the evidence I have rendered in court .
â€¢ There was dispute over the noises that Pistorius claimed to have heard on the night in question : the window opening , the toilet door slamming and magazine rack moving inside the toilet room .
Nel queried why Pistorius would have experienced a "" startle response "" to the third sound when he was expecting someone to be in the bathroom .
Derman insisted the opposite was true .
Asked why someone with an exaggerated startle response would visit a shooting range , the witness argued that Pistorius would not have reacted in the same way as he was in control of the sound ( gun ) .
That 's it for today .
The trial resumes on Tuesday morning , when it is expected that the defence will conclude its case .
Thank you for reading .
Hello !
magazine has published an interview with June Steenkamp , the mother of Reeva Steenkamp .
She says she has forgiven Pistorius : I do n't hate Oscar .
I 've forgiven him .
I have to â€
“
that 's my religion .
But I am determined to face him and reclaim my daughter .
It 's important for him to know that I 'm there , that Reeva 's mother who gave birth to her and loved her , is there for her .
Roux says he does intend to wrap up the defence but wants to consult with his team .
He asks if the court could adjourn until tomorrow .
Nel does n't object .
Court breaks for the day .
I will post a summary shortly .
She refers to the order made by the court on 20 May that Pistorius was to undergo the 30-day mental health evaluation .
She says the three psychiatrists subsequently signed the report in which they agreed their findings .
The judge points out that when the report was presented to the court , both state and defence indicated they did not dispute its findings .
Judge Masipa says she is not persuaded that Dr Kotze falls into the normal category of witness .
Her presence in court does not give the defence an entitlement to consult with her .
They can consult Dr Fine , their own psychiatrist , she says .
She will not allow the defence to consult with Dr Kotze .
The court would normally take a lunch break at this time but is waiting for the judge to return with her ruling on whether the defence can consult with the state - appointed psychiatrist .
Here is the one - page psychiatrists ' report .
It is signed by Dr Carla Kotze , the state - appointed psychiatrist ; Dr Leon Fine , the defence - appointed psychiatrist ; and Professor HW Pretorius , the psychiatrist appointed by the court .
Judge Masipa adjourns the hearing for a few minutes to consult with her assessors .
Kotze was one of the three psychiatrists who produced the report concluding Pistorius was not suffering a mental disorder when he shot Steenkamp .
Nel says that is the whole report .
Why would there be a need to consult with a different psychiatrist if you have your own , he asks .
Roux insists that anybody consulted by the state who is not called as a witness can be made available to consult with the defence and possibly called as a witness by them .
This is what happened with the neighbours not called by the state who then testified for the defence , he says .
Roux says the defence does not intend to call Dr Fine as a witness .
Nel says that if the defence calls their appointee , Dr Fine , "" in all probability "" he would call Dr Kotze .
"" It 's impossible "" for him to call her now .
Roux says that if Nel does n't call the state - appointed psychiatrist as a witness , the defence has the right to consult and then can call her to testify .
Barry Roux is on his feet .
This is probably our last witness , he says , but he wants some time to consult .
He 'd like to talk to the state - appointed psychiatrist Dr Carla Kotze , who 's in court today .
Nel objects :
Kotze is the state 's psychiatrist .
Roux says she is not the state 's witness .
We are entitled to consult with her , he insists .
We need some time with her to understand her findings .
Nel does not agree .
Dr Leon Fine was the psychiatrist appointed by the defence to the panel .
The state did not consult with him because he was the defence 's witness .
Nel :
They can not have a bite at every panel member in consultation before they decide who to call .
Kenny Oldwage says he has no further questions for Derman .
The witness is excused .
Oldwage says it was put to the court that the night before the shooting , Pistorius was not anxious , but relaxed .
Can a person become less vulnerable or less anxious when they are relaxed , he asks Derman , who says no .
Oldwage :
Does the approach to simply walk away fit the fight - or - flight approach ?
Derman :
No â€
¦
If one believes the perceived threat is going to catch you and harm you , then we are left with only a fight response .
Oldwage asks for a short break .
Once again , Nel argues that Derman is biased .
He insists he has come to court to give an objective opinion .
Nel :
With intention to kill , he shot the person behind the door .
That 's what he wanted to do , and that 's what he did .
Your evidence in no way affects his intention on that night .
Derman :
From what I understand , it was his intention to shoot .
Nel has no more questions for this witness .
Kenny Oldwage will re - examine for the defence .
Nel refers to earlier testimony by defence witness and ballistics expert Tom Wolmarans , who said Pistorius had fired at the door .
Derman says he is not aware of Wolmarans ' evidence .
Nel :
He fired at the sound .
Why did he do that ?
Derman :
To nullify the threat â€ ¦
He told me he thought there was a burglar .
Nel :
You do n't want to give an answer that will not benefit the accused â€ ¦
Is that not so ?
Derman :
No , no .
That is not true .
Derman eventually concedes that Pistorius did not tell him he heard movement from inside the toilet cubicle .
Nel pounces : you earlier said you could not recall .
This shows the witness is biased to the defence , he claims .
My first answer was that I ca n't recall , says Derman .
I think it is quite clear that I am not certain .
Derman is still on the stand .
Nel leaps back to the three sounds Pistorius said startled him on the night he shot Steenkamp , specifically the magazine rack .
If the athlete had said he heard movement inside the toilet , Nel says , you would remember that ?
Derman says he ca n't recall if Pistorius told him that .
Nel says this is "" the strangest thing â€ ¦ you would have remembered "" .
Derman insists he is just telling the truth .
Nel is doing his customary dancing from one topic to another .
He 's asking Derman again about Pistorius ' ability to run on his stumps .
It 's something you ca n't exclude , he asks the witness ?
Nel says he is nearing the end of the cross - examination .
He asks for a 10-minute break to go through his notes .
Court adjourns for 10 minutes .
Nel goes back to the incident in which Pistorius fired a gun into a watermelon .
Nel says the accused showed no anxiety or fear in this video .
Derman says he 's only seen it once , he can not say .
Nel says Pistorius gave evidence that 13 February was "" a very nice , relaxing evening "" and he was n't stressed .
Derman confirms he did not re - test Pistorius ' stress levels before giving evidence but relied on historical assessments .
Nel turns to the testing done by Derman of Pistorius ' stress levels during athletics competitions .
Pistorius ' results were 28 , 24 and 19 respectively .
His stress levels dropped significantly after the competition .
But the mean ( average ) score across all disabled athletes , Derman says , was 18.9 before competition and 16.1 post competition .
You did n't test him after 14 February 2013 , when Steenkamp was killed , Nel asks .
Derman confirms this .
Derman :
Even though there can be an expectation of a sound , vigilance of a sound , it potentiates the startle and makes it worse .
Nel :
His awareness is higher because of the second startle [ the door slamming ]
â€
¦
He 's expecting a sound .
The [ third ] startle would not have an effect on him .
Derman :
With respect , Mr Nel has got it wrong .
It 's exactly the opposite .
Nel says if Pistorius had already heard the sound of the toilet door , the third sound â€ “ the magazine rack â€ “ would not have startled him ; he would have expected the sound .
Derman disagrees : it depends on who is behind the door .
There is also the fear factor .
And when Pistorius fires his gun on the shooting range , he is in charge .
Nel asks Derman if Pistorius mentioned another sound ( after the window , door and magazine rack ) ; Derman says he did n't .
If he 'd mentioned another door sound , you 'd have remembered that ?
The witness agrees .
The exchange between Nel and Derman is becoming very testy .
The prosecutor has just rebuked the witness for calling him "" Sir "" â€ “ you must address the court , not me , Nel says .
( Witnesses typically address their responses to the judge : "" my lady "" . )
Nel wants to know what it was about the sound that startled Pistorius . ""
The sound itself , "" Derman replies .
Did Pistorius not tell you what he thought caused the sound , he asks Derman .
Only that it was the magazine rack , the witness responds .
Nel :
The accused told you he heard a sound made by the magazine rack â€
¦
How did he describe that sound ?
Derman : I can not recall how specifically he described it .
Nel :
If we do n't use the word specific , what did he describe to you ?
Derman :
That he heard a sound .
Nel :
So how did it come in that that sound was the sound of a magazine rack ?
Derman :
That 's what he told me â€
¦
It was a sound that startled him .
Nel says he wants to take his time on this because it will become important later .
He says the magazine rack by itself would not make a sound .
Derman says he assumed the sound was somebody moving the rack .
Nel :
He shot and killed someone that made that sound .
The three sounds were the window opening , the toilet door slamming and magazine rack moving inside the toilet room , Derman confirms .
Quizzed by Nel , Derman says Pistorius told him the third sound was the magazine rack .
Nel is questioning Derman again .
He starts with what he calls "" the Arnu Fourie incident "" .
( Fourie , Pistorius ' room - mate in London in 2012 , moved out of their shared accommodation .
Reports at the time suggested it was because "" Oscar was constantly screaming in anger at people on the phone "" . )
Derman says Fourie moved due to illness risk , not argument .
Reporters in court in Pretoria are saying that the footage of Pistorius re - enacting the events of the night he shot Steenkamp will not be raised in court .
As Barry Roux , lead counsel for the defence , has already indicated that Derman will be his last witness , this does raise the possibility that the defence could wrap up its evidence today .
Though in a trial that has already seen innumerable delays and postponements , we have heard that before .
Nel says vulnerability should be viewed in the context of the person .
A homeless person on the street would be vulnerable .
Poor people without houses with alarms would be vulnerable .
Older people without protection would be vulnerable .
Pistorius is someone with the means to protect himself , says Nel .
He has alarms .
He has a big support group around him .
Nel :
That whole scenario mitigates his vulnerability .
Derman : I disagree strongly .
Nel :
If Mr Pistorius was vulnerable on that night , he armed himself â€ ¦ with a gun in his hand he 's less vulnerable .
Derman :
He might indeed be less vulnerable but how much less vulnerable I do not know .
Nel asks for the tea break .
Court breaks .
Nel :
Are n't you using this study merely to create an atmosphere , and it 's not relevant in this particular case at all ?
This particular article deals with disability hate crime .
We do n't have it here .
Derman : In this matter that is correct â€
¦
But we are speaking about vulnerability â€
¦
It is a very sad fact that individuals who are disabled suffer more attacks than people who are not disabled â€ ¦ People who are disabled who feel vulnerable for fear of attack have got reason to .
Derman says Nel is wrong in his interpretation â€ “ for all the studies combined in the meta - analysis there was a 31 % increase in attacks .
It is higher for individuals with mental illness .
Nel says that a study used by Derman to show that disabled people are more likely to be attacked deals mainly with those with mental illness .
Derman disagrees : it covers a variety of disabilities , he says .
There was only one study from South Africa in the meta - analysis , Nel says .
It covers people with dementia and abuse by carers , he says ; it 's not relevant .
Nel asks Derman if he ever considered the state 's case , or that Pistorius ' version might be "" a lie "" . ""
Of course I have , "" Derman replies .
"" I know that any report that I give is open to cross - examination . ""
Nel moves on but Derman wants to add more .
Derman says that Pistorius ' ability to flee is very different .
He does n't want the court to think that Pistorius could have fled "" like you or I "" .
But he could have walked out of the bedroom door , said Nel , or hidden in the main bedroom .
He could walk out the door , at the same pace he walked to brush his teeth .
Nel turns to Derman 's report and testimony on the fight - or - flight response ( Derman spoke about this in his evidence last week ) .
Nel says this response is present in everybody .
Nel :
Even on the objective facts , there was at least an option for the accused to flee â€ “ even walk out of the room â€ “ on the night of the incident .
Derman : There indeed is that option .
Derman says Pistorius needs to run at an angle "" so he does not touch that painful area on the end of the left stump "" .
But he runs with his chest facing forward , Nel asks .
Derman agrees .
Nel :
Do you know when he ran that night ?
Derman : It is still not clear to me â€
¦
There was a mention of running before he got to the corridor and then at some stage later there was a mention of running back to the bedroom .
Nel :
In the accused 's mind , he ran on that evening ?
Derman :
Yes .
Derman says he asked Pistorius to run but ca n't remember if he asked the athlete to hold his arm out as if he were holding a gun .
Nel says he find this interesting .
When Pistorius demonstrated walking on his stumps , he had the gun in his right hand ?
Derman :
Yes .
Derman confirms that he asked Pistorius to run as fast as he possibly can .
There were two separate things he asked him about , Derman says : to demonstrate how he moved down the passage to the bathroom and to run as fast as he can .
The first of those is what he told the court on Thursday .
Why ca n't you be sure , Nel asks : you were there .
Nel moves on .
Did Pistorius demonstrate to the doctor how he ran on his stumps ?
Derman confirms that he did .
I wanted to gauge what he meant by ' run ' .
I know that Mr Pistorius can not runï»¿. Nel asks if it was ever demonstrated to him that Pistorius can walk backwards on his stumps .
Is it possible ?
( This must be a reference to the video aired on Australian TV , in which Pistorius is seen moving backwards on his stumps . )
Derman says he has not seen it , but ca n't see why it would n't be possible .
Nel says the normal range on the anxiety scoring is between 50 and 70 .
The psychiatrists on the panel did not find Pistorius ' score of 70 to be significant .
They also found he was not suffering from any of the disorders listed in DSM5 ( the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition ) .
Nel says the Health Professions Act states that psychological scores can only be interpreted by psychology professionals .
Not even psychiatrists would comment on this , outside their area of expertise , he says .
Derman says that when test results are given to a physician , he is held qualified to interpret results and ask for clarification from experts .
Nel starts quoting from the Health Professions Act of 1974 .
Oldwage objects , saying he does not have copies of this .
It must be available , Nel replies airily .
It would have been wonderful if you had brought copies for everyone , says Judge Masipa .
( It 's here . )
Nel refers to previous testimony by Derman , in which the doctor said a score of 71 in the test "" would have constituted a finding "" .
The witness is not qualified to make such a statement , the prosecutor insists .
Deep sarcasm from Nel today , who earlier referred to the witness as "" Mr Derman "" ; corrected by the defence , he now stresses "" Professor Derman "" at every opportunity .
Derman says he is not making a diagnosis .
He says Pistorius scored 70 in an anxiety assessment with the Weskoppies panel ; he thinks that is high .
Nel says 70 is the top end of the normal range .
Oldwage says Nel must tell the court whether state - appointed psychiatrist Dr Carla Kotze will be called , if he is to rely on her opinion .
Nel says he will rephrase .
If Kotze says the anxiety score is not high , what would Derman say ?
The witness says he would cede to her as she is more qualified to comment .
Derman confirms he met with Dr Leon Fine , one of the psychiatrists on the Weskoppies hospital panel that assessed Pistorius , before his 30-day evaluation , and spoke to him again afterwards .
Nel asks if he is entitled and qualified to testify about these results .
Derman says yes , on some aspects , such as anxiety .
For others , he says , one would need to be qualified in psychometric testing .
Nel says he is not answering the question .
Derman says he is commenting on the interpretation of the test .
The interpretation has already been made , by the experts : I do feel entitled to comment because that is what I do in clinical practice.ï
» ¿ Physicians make objective observations all the time , Derman adds .
Nel says he would argue that Derman is unable to be objective because he is Pistorius ' treating physician .
Would Derman have difficulty giving objective evidence if the accused were a family member ?
The witness says he would .
Nel :
Why would you draw a line between this person , Mr Pistorius â€ ¦ and a family member ?
Derman : Very simply , because he is not a family member .
He is one of a team of individuals I have travelled with â€ ¦
I believe I can be objective with respect to the evidence I have rendered in court .
Derman â€ “ who continues to work as Pistorius ' doctor
â€ “ says there is no a conflict of interest :
I believe my report is as objective as possible , backed with scientific evidence .
Nel says he wants to deal with what Derman 's report is not : it 's not a forensic report , he asks , and does n't deal with culpability or criminal capacity ?
Derman agrees .
Derman says he has read relevant sections of the court record over the weekend .
He was given it by the defence .
Nel pounces on this â€ “ that information is not in the bail record : You are wrong .
Where did you get it ?
Judge Masipa says she perhaps needs to read the court record herself before she can decide .
Nel says it 's not such a big issue
â€ “ he 'd rather continue with the evidence .
If Oldwage wants Nel to say he should have been more clear , he 'll say that .
And with that we 're allowed to move on .
Nel resumes cross - examination of Professor Wayne Derman .
State and defence are still disputing whether Nel 's questioning of Derman last week was misleading over the issue of whether Pistorius ran down the passage to the bathroom .
The defence says he did not run there .
Following criticism of the airing of footage showing Pistorius on his stumps re - enacting the events around the death of Steenkamp ,
Australia 's Channel Seven has issued this statement by Mark Llewellyn , executive producer of the Sunday Night programme : This was a significant investigation , by Walkley award - winning journalists , examining the critical 85 minutes on Valentineâ€ ™ s Night 2013 when Reeva Steenkamp was shot dead by Oscar Pistorius .
The material shown on Sunday Night goes to the heart of both the prosecution and defense cases , including the account provided by Oscar Pistorius .
We would not have run the footage if we thought we had obtained it illegally .
The story was run in Australia only and not made available to any other territory .
It did not say how it obtained the footage .
Nel says he did not raise the question about running â€ “ Derman "" volunteered the line of questioning "" about it .
There was no misleading of the witness , he says .
Nel was about to start his cross - examination of Derman , but defence lawyer Kenny Oldwage first wants to deal with an objection he raised last week .
There is disagreement over whether Pistorius "" ran "" down the corridor to the bathroom .
Oldwage says the exchange between Nel and Derman was misleading : Nel is on his feet .
He does not owe anybody an apology , he says .
Oldwage objects : he never asked for an apology , he insists .
Masipa says that on Friday she verbally amended an earlier order she had made banning publication of details from the psychological reports that had not been read out in court .
On Friday , media lawyers negotiated an agreement with the defence , she says .
The order now reads : The contents â€ ¦ may be published in accordance with the agreement between defence attorneys and media legal representatives .
You can see the main findings in Wednesday 's live blog .
Judge Masipa is in court , and the session starts .
The hearing should resume shortly .
Pistorius is in court .
Derman is Professor Wayne Derman , chief medical officer of the South African Paralympic team at the 2012 London Olympics , who is due to be cross - examined by prosecutor Gerrie Nel this morning .
At the weekend , Pistorius 's family condemned what they called "" a staggering breach of trust "" after the broadcast of a secret video that showed the athlete re - enacting the night he shot Steenkamp .
As David Smith reports : The footage , leaked to Australian television 's Channel Seven , shows Pistorius running awkwardly without his prosthetic limbs , his right arm outstretched pretending to hold a gun .
Two men in shirts and ties watch with their hands in their pockets .
In another sequence the athlete , wearing a blue Nike vest and black Lycra shorts , can be seen struggling on all fours to drag a motionless woman out of a small toilet cubicle similar to the one in his home .
He is also seen with his prosthetics on , carrying the woman down a staircase .
Pistorius can reportedly be heard on the soundtrack of the video simulating the warning he gave the perceived intruder : "" I 'll call the police , get out , get out !
Get the fuck out ! ""
He can then be heard screaming hysterically as he recreates the moment he realised it was Steenkamp he had shot .
Pistorius appears emotionless during the reconstruction .
According to Australia 's Channel Seven , the part of Steenkamp was played by his sister , Aimee , and the video was filmed at the home of his uncle , Arnold , where he has been staying since the tragedy .
Pistorius 's defence team said the footage had been shot for an American company , The Evidence Room , which specialises in forensic animations of crime scenes .
The company had been hired to visually map the events on the night of the killing .
Brian Webber , a member of the defence team , said : The ' visual mapping ' was for trial preparation only and was not intended to be used for any other purpose .
It has now emerged that an Australian broadcaster has obtained some of this footage from The Evidence Room and has just gone to air with it .
We wish to make it very clear that the material that has been aired was obtained illegally and in breach of the non - disclosure agreement with The Evidence Room .
For the family , the airing of this footage constitutes a staggering breach of trust and an invasion of the family 's privacy â€
¦
Whilst we can not imagine how any of the footage would not support Oscar 's version , we will only be in a position to comment further once we have had the opportunity to study what has been aired .
The high court in Pretoria resumes this morning in the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp on 14 February 2013 .
The athlete denies murder , saying he killed his girlfriend by accident after shooting through a locked toilet door thinking she was an intruder .
Last Thursday , the hearing was adjourned until today to allow prosecutor Gerrie Nel time to consult with the state psychiatrist who examined Pistorius during his 30-day mental health evaluation .
The panel of experts concluded that the sprinter was not suffering a mental illness when he shot Steenkamp .
The psychiatrists wrote : Currently the accused presents with an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood that developed after the alleged incident .
At the time of the alleged offences , the accused did not suffer from a mental disorder or mental defect that affected his ability to distinguish between the rightful and wrongful nature of his deeds .
A mental disorder or mental defect did not affect his ability to act in accordance with the said appreciation of the rightful or wrongful nature of his deeds.ï » ¿ On Thursday , Pistorius ' defence team revealed more details from a separate psychologist 's report , also compiled during the 30-day evaluation .
Judge Thokozile Masipa had previously barred reporters from publishing information from the report that had not been aired in court .
Defence lawyer Kenny Oldwage read from the findings by Dr Jonathan Scholtz : [ There was a ] split in his personality â€ ¦ the one a vulnerable , scared disabled person , the other a strong physical person achieving beyond expectation and finding reward for it both intra - physically and interpersonally .
I believe the construction of ' the two Oscars ' â€ ¦ finally gelled into a final split .
The one Oscar being an international superstar , more confident and feeling more in control at 1.84 m tall .
That part of him falling back on his physicality and ' never say die ' attitude that had served him so well .
Although not completely at ease , he felt less vulnerable in that state .
The other Oscar being a vulnerable and fearful disabled person , at less than 1.5 m once his prostheses were removed and he was alone at night .
That part of him falling back on to his anxiety and fear , not feeling in control .
With his prostheses on many people can damage him but without them he feels defenceless . '
I am stuffed without my legs on . '
For this reason he acquired a weapon and even searched for one that was lighter and smaller so that he could always keep it with him .

David will also be covering the hearing in Pretoria today : you can follow our tweets @SmithInAfrica and @Claire_Phipps .
The court should also hear today the continued cross - examination of Professor Wayne Derman , chief medical officer of the South African Paralympic team at the 2012 London Olympics , who has testified that Pistorius suffered high levels of stress compared with other elite disabled athletes .
Disabled individuals can have an "" exaggerated "" fight - or - flight response , he told the court last week ."
2014-07-07,"Australia 's Seven television network has denied illegally obtaining a video of Oscar Pistorius re - enacting the shooting of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp which it broadcast on its current affairs program Sunday Night .
The program attracted 1.3 million viewers on Sunday and won its timeslot but the broadcast was immediately condemned by the Olympianâ€ ™ s defence team as illegal and a breach of trust .
â€œWe would not have run the footage if we thought we had obtained it illegally , â€ �
Sunday Nightâ€ ™ s executive producer , Mark Llewellyn , told Guardian Australia .
â€œThe story was run in Australia only and not made available to any other territory.â€ � Sunday Night reporters Ross Coulthart and Steve Pennells said they had obtained extraordinary video â€œkept from his murder trialâ€ � of Pistorius recreating the scene on Valentineâ€ ™ s Day last year when he shot and killed Steenkamp in his South African home .
They said the footage of the athlete walking on his stumps was filmed at Pistoriusâ€ ™ s uncleâ€ ™ s home and was designed to demonstrate his claim that he mistook his girlfriend for an intruder , and killed her accidentally .
Pistorius is also shown bashing down the bathroom door and pulling Steenkampâ€ ™ s body
â€ “ played by his sister â€ “ out of the bathroom and down the stairs .
"" For the family , the airing of this footage constitutes a staggering breach of trust and an invasion of the family 's privacy , â€ � a member of the defence team , Brian Webber , said .
â€œIt has come to our attention that Channel Seven purchased this footage unlawfully .
In addition , during our engagement with Channel Seven , we received an undertaking that they would not air any of the material before the end of the trial.â€ � Sunday Night interviewed members of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s defence team for the program as well as an American forensic investigator , Scott Roder , who concluded Pistorius was not guilty of murder .
Llewellyn defended the feature story which contained a â€œlive viewer voteâ€ � asking the question : â€œDid Oscar Pistorius deliberately kill his girlfriend?â€ �
The poll was derided as inappropriate by some viewers on Twitter and criticised by leading TV blogger David Knox on TV Tonight .
â€œTV networks , it seems , are now comfortable with viewers voting on the guilt or innocence of accused murderers , â€ � Knox wrote .
â€œIs it acceptable to turn a murder case into a viewer vote because it is in another country and not under Australian jurisdiction?â€ �
Llewellyn said : â€œThis was a significant investigation , by Walkley award - winning journalists , examining the critical 85 minutes on Valentineâ€ ™ s night 2013 when Reeva Steenkamp was shot dead by Oscar Pistorius .
â€œThe material shown on Sunday Night goes to the heart of both the prosecution and defence cases , including the account provided by Oscar Pistorius.â€ � Roder , who was hired by the Pistorius family to analyse his version of events , told Sunday Night Pistorius did not mean to kill his girlfriend . ""
Absolutely , the physical evidence is consistent and his story remains unchanged , "" Roder told Sunday Night .
"" If you look at the evidence , Oscar 's clearly not guilty.â€ � News of the secret footage has dominated the news bulletins in South Africa where Pistorius is on trial for murdering Steenkamp ."
2014-07-07,"Oscar Pistorius 's defence team in his murder trial plans to rest its case on Tuesday , meaning that the athlete could be just weeks away from learning his fate .
"" I can say prima facie we plan to close the case , "" the defence counsel , Barry Roux , told the judge , Thokozile Masipa , on Monday .
"" I just need to get proper instructions .
Can we stand till tomorrow morning , my lady , just to confer with everyone around me and make sure it is the right move ? ""
Pistorius , 27 , is accused of shooting his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , during an argument at his home in Pretoria , South Africa , in February last year .
He denies the charge , claiming he shot her accidentally after thinking he heard an intruder in his bathroom .
If found guilty of murder , the Paralympian faces up to 25 years in jail .
Since opening on 3 March in a blaze of media attention , the trial , originally set down for three weeks , has run for 38 working days over four months punctuated by several long adjournments and postponements .
If the prosecution does not call further witnesses on Tuesday , all the evidence will have been heard .
Masipa will agree with both sides a date by which they must submit their closing arguments in writing and return to court to deliver them , likely to be next month .
She will then retire to consider her verdict .
The trial will then adjourn again before returning for mitigation arguments and sentence .
Should the judgment go against him , Pistorius has the right to appeal .
He is likely to remain on bail throughout the process .
On Monday the prosecutor , Gerrie Nel , forced the final defence witness , sports doctor Wayne Derman , to contradict Pistorius 's own testimony .
The athlete has previously told the court that he was frightened by a noise in the toilet and fired accidentally , claiming : "" I never intended to shoot anyone . ""
Nel challenged Derman : "" With intention to kill , he shot the person behind the door .
That 's what he wanted to do , and that 's what he did .
Your evidence in no way affects his intention on that night . ""
Derman conceded : "" From what I understand , it was his intention to shoot . ""
There was no mention in court of a secret video that shows the athlete re - enacting the shooting of Steenkamp , filmed for the defence team and leaked to Australian television .
In the footage , Pistorius walks backwards on his stumps , appearing to cast doubt on the defence claim that he has limited mobility without wearing his prosthesis .
South Africa 's national prosecuting authority insisted that the prosecution had not seen the video .
But Nel challenged Derman over his claim that the athlete had limited mobility on his stumps . ""
Can I just ask you then was it ever demonstrated to you that Mr Pistorius was able to walk backwards on his stumps ? ""
Nel asked .
Derman replied : "" It was never demonstrated to me . ""
Nel : ""
Do you think it 's possible ? ""
Derman : "" I 've never seen him walk backwards
but I do n't see why it should not be possible . ""
Meanwhile Hello ! magazine published an interview with Steenkamp 's mother , June , who said she had forgiven Pistorius .
"" I do n't hate Oscar , "" she told the magazine .
"" I 've forgiven him .
I have to –
that 's my religion .
But I am determined to face him and reclaim my daughter .
It 's important for him to know that I 'm there , that Reeva 's mother who gave birth to her and loved her , is there for her . """

The state will file its closing arguments to the court on 30 July .
The defence will file its closing arguments on 4 August .
The court will reconvene to hear closing arguments on 7 and 8 August .

â€¢ Judge Masipa ordered that no details of the arguments be published until they are heard in court .
â€¢ Barry Roux , lead counsel for Pistorius , said the defence had had to abandon efforts to get some witnesses to testify , because they did not want their voices broadcast "" around the world "" .
Witnesses can ask not to be shown on television but audio of their testimony is broadcast .
Some commentators suggested Roux had put this on record in case of a future appeal .
â€¢ Roux also told the court he could not call the defence - appointed psychiatrist , Dr Leon Fine , as he has had a heart attack .
â€¢ Affidavits filed to the judge failed to shed any light on what happened to the missing extension cord from Pistorius ' bedroom .

The live blog will be back on 7 August when the trial resumes , but that 's it for today .
Thanks for reading .
An interesting take from Rebecca Davis on the Guardian Africa network on the central position Pistorius ' disability has taken in the murder trial in recent weeks .
She writes : ï»¿The image of Pistorius as having transcended disability has been largely shattered by his murder trial .
In recent days the defence has been at pains to stress the athleteâ€ ™
s
extremely limited and painful mobility without his prosthetic legs .
One can imagine that for Pistorius to lay his disability bare before the world must be the source of anxiety .
But a number of disabled commentators have expressed concern that the use of disability in his defence may have elements of expedience .
Prosecution and defence will now retire to put together their closing arguments ( "" heads of argument "" , in court parlance ) .
Written versions will be handed in to the court : the state must file by 30 July ; the defence has until 4 August .
Nel asked that they be filed with Judge Masipa 's clerk , not the general court clerk .
Masipa has ordered that no detail from the written arguments be published before they are read in court .
Prosecution and defence will also exchange arguments before they appear in court .
That court hearing will come on 7 and 8 August .
The arguments are likely to be lengthy â€ “ one South African commentator has estimated the state 's version could run to 200 pages .
The judge then takes as much time as she needs to consider her verdict .
There is no jury .
But she has two court assessors , Janet Henzen - Du - Toit and Themba Mazibuko , who advise her .
There is more on the role of the assessors here .
The judge must consider not only the charge of premeditated murder , but also the lesser charge of culpable homicide ( manslaughter ) .
Alongside the charge over the death of Steenkamp , Pistorius has pleaded not guilty to two counts of discharging firearms in public , and another of illegal possession of ammunition .
Yesterday saw a tussle in court between prosecutor Nel and defence counsel Roux over whether the Pistorius team was entitled to consult with Dr Carla Kotze , the state - appointed psychiatrist on the three - person panel that assessed the athlete during his 30-day evaluation .
Here is the one - page psychiatrists ' report .
It is signed by Kotze ; Dr Leon Fine , the defence - appointed psychiatrist ; and Professor HW Pretorius , the psychiatrist appointed by the court .
The judge rejected the defence request to consult with Kotze , telling Roux he had his own psychiatrist in Dr Fine .
But Roux revealed this morning an obstacle to this : June Steenkamp , Reeva Steenkamp 's mother , was once again in court today to hear the dates set for the closing arguments of the trial .
In an interview with Hello ! magazine this week , she said she had forgiven Pistorius for killing her daughter : ï»¿I do n't hate Oscar .
I 've forgiven him .
I have to â€
“
that 's my religion .
But I am determined to face him and reclaim my daughter .
It 's important for him to know that I 'm there , that Reeva 's mother who gave birth to her and loved her , is there for her .
It looks as though we will not discover what happened to the missing extension cord during this trial .
Judge Masipa said earlier in the trial that she was "" very unhappy "" at the state 's failure to produce an electrical cord that was in Pistorius ' bedroom on the night of the shooting .
The cord appeared in police photographs but was not listed on an inventory of items removed from the house .
The defence says its disappearance compromises the case because the cord was raised by the state in cross - examination of Pistorius .
Masipa ordered the officer in charge of securing the house to account for what happened .
Today the judge was handed those affidavits but Roux revealed they shed no light on what happened to the cord .
In his testimony , Pistorius said he was bringing in two fans from the balcony when Steenkamp must have got out of bed to go to the toilet without him noticing .
But prosucutor Gerrie Nel claimed the extension cord could not have reached to the spot in the bedroom where Pistorius said he had moved the fans .
The defence disputed this .
The Associated Press has filed this quick summary of this morning 's hearing : The chief defence lawyer in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius says he has closed his case , and the judge says final arguments will be held in court on 7 and 8 August .
Lawyer Barry Roux said on Tuesday that he had finished calling witnesses to testify in the trial of Pistorius , who killed girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp by firing through a closed toilet door in his home .
Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel says the prosecution will file closing arguments on 30 July and the defence will do so on 4 August .
He and Roux also agreed to return to court on 7 August to make final arguments before Judge Thokozile Masipa .
Pistorius says he killed Steenkamp by mistake .
The prosecution says he shot her after an argument .
It is striking that , as the defence closes , there has not been much evidence directly addressing the other charges faced by Pistorius .
Alongside the charge of murder , he is accused of two counts of discharging firearms in public , and another of illegal possession of ammunition .
I 've taken these details from the BBC :
Discharging firearms in public , first count :
He allegedly discharged a firearm at a restaurant on 11 January 2013 .
Pistorius blamed his friend Darren Fresco for passing him a loaded gun but he denies pulling the trigger .
Discharging firearms in public , second count : He allegedly fired a gun through a car sunroof while with then girlfriend Samantha Taylor and Fresco on 30 November 2012 .
He has admitted getting angry after a police officer inspected his gun which was lying on a car seat , when they were stopped for speeding .
But he denies firing a gun , as alleged by both Ms Taylor and Mr Fresco .
Illegal possession of ammunition Pistorius is charged with being in possession of .38 ammunition ; he does not have a licence for a gun that takes that ammunition , or a permit to be in possession of it or a dealer 's licence .
Pistorius told the court the bullets belonged to his father and he had them for safe - keeping .
If found guilty , Pistorius could face five years in prison on each of the first two counts , and 15 years for the illegal possession of ammunition .
Roux 's comments about the reluctance of some witnesses to appear for the defence could be laying a foundation for a possible future appeal , some commentators are suggesting : Roux also mentioned that Dr Leon Fine , the defence - appointed psychiatrist who was on the panel for Pistorius ' 30-day mental health evaluation has had a heart attack and can not be called to give evidence .
A short hearing â€
“
the court will now break until we reconvene to hear closing arguments on 7 and 8 August .
The judge agrees to an order to prohibit any publication of the closing arguments until they are heard in court .
Nel tells the judge what will happen next .
The state will file its closing arguments to the court on 30 July .
The defence will file its closing arguments on 4 August .
They will argue the matter in court on 7 and 8 August .
The arguments should not be published before they are read in court , Nel asks .
Roux says there were several witnesses the defence would have liked to have called , but they refused because they did not want their testimony to be broadcast ( witnesses can ask not to be filmed , but their voices are broadcast ) .
Roux would like the court to bear this in mind .
And with that , he closes the defence case .
Barry Roux , lead defence counsel , says he has received the affidavits about the missing electrical cord that was in the house on the night of the shooting but subsequently disappeared â€ “
it was not in the police inventory of items taken from the house .
The affidavits confirm the cord is not in the house but nothing more , he says .
Oscar Pistorius has arrived at court : Reporters in the court in Pretoria are suggesting this morning 's hearing might not , after all , be a straightforward closing of the defence case :
Welcome to the live blog of day 39 of the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp .
The defence said yesterday , as its last witness , Professor Wayne Derman , left the stand , that it intended to close its case today .
We would expect that to happen fairly shortly after the court reconvenes this morning , but as ever in this trial â€ “ which has already been subject to several delays â€ “ we can not be certain .
It is then expected that the trial would need to adjourn for between four and six weeks for both sides to put together their closing arguments .
The trial , originally set down for three weeks , has so far run for 38 working days over four months punctuated by several long adjournments and postponements .
Pistorius denies murder , saying he shot Steenkamp by accident , believing her to be an intruder .
He also denies two counts of discharging firearms in public , and another of illegal possession of ammunition .
Here 's what happened on Monday : â€¢ A video showing the athlete re - enacting his version of how he shot Steenkamp , and then carried her from the bathroom , was not mentioned in court .
The Australian TV channel that aired the footage insisted it did not believe it was obtained illegally .
South Africa 's National Prosecution Authority said prosecutor Gerrie Nel and his team had not watched the footage .
â€¢ Professor Wayne Derman , chief medical officer of the South African Paralympic team at the 2012 London Olympics , told the court that Pistorius had the intention to shoot when he approached the bathroom of his home on the night of 14 February 2013 .
State prosecutor Gerrie Nel told him : With intention to kill , he shot the person behind the door .
That 's what he wanted to do , and that 's what he did .
â€¢ Derman rebuffed claims by Nel that he was a biased witness and unable to act objectively in this case because he was too close to Pistorius , having treated him over many years .
The doctor told the court : He is not a family member .
He is one of a team of individuals I have travelled with â€ ¦
I believe I can be objective with respect to the evidence I have rendered in court .
â€¢ Nel queried why Pistorius would have experienced a "" startle response "" to a sound from inside the toilet cubicle when he was expecting someone to be in the bathroom .
Derman insisted the opposite was true .
Asked why someone with an exaggerated startle response would visit a shooting range , the witness argued that Pistorius would not have reacted in the same way as he was in control of the sound when firing a gun .

2014-07-08,"Lawyers defending Oscar Pistorius wrapped up their case on Tuesday but said some witnesses refused to testify because of media attention , raising the prospect of an appeal on the grounds that broadcasting the trial rendered it unfair .
The Paralympian , who admits shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp but denies murder , left immediately after a short hearing at the high court in Pretoria , where 7 - 8 August was set for closing arguments .
The end is now in sight for what has been described as the world 's most - watched celebrity murder trial since the acquittal of O J Simpson in 1995 .
Some 37 witnesses – 21 for the state and 16 for the defence – testified during 39 days of evidence that made South African legal history by being televised live .
Many , including Pistorius , chose to remain off - camera so only their voices were broadcast .
But in a surprise disclosure on Tuesday , defence counsel Barry Roux said : "" We put on record , not that the court can do anything about it but just so it 's on the record , that we were unable to call a number of witnesses who simply refused to testify because they said they did n't want their voices all over the world . ""
The "" gavel - to - gavel "" radio and TV coverage of the trial became something of a cultural phenomenon , spawning spoof Twitter accounts and YouTube videos .
Witness evidence was dissected in minute detail on a dedicated 24-hour TV channel in South Africa .
Early in the trial , a witness whose mobile phone number was read out in court subsequently received abusive calls .
A source close to Pistorius said five witnesses had declined to appear because of the intense scrutiny .
"" It was a media trial , "" the source said .
"" Without the media , it would have been very different .
You 've got to be a halfwit to think it 's a fair trial .
The full truth has n't come out .
"" The defence did have the right to subpoena witnesses but chose not to do so .
A legal expert suggested that Roux was paving the way for an appeal should Pistorius be found guilty . ""
The song and dance about not calling witnesses is clearly setting up an argument , ' It 's impossible for a fair trial in these circumstances , ' "" said the expert , who did not wish to be named .
The trial , which began on 3 March , has gripped millions worldwide and led to 27-year - old Pistorius vomiting into a bucket and sobbing hysterically as he argued that Steenkamp 's death was a tragic accident .
The "" blade runner "" , whose intimate WhatsApp messages were read out in court , was supported by his family , usually including sister Aimee and uncle Arnold , in the front row of the public gallery .
Who killed Steenkamp , a 29-year - old model and law graduate , on Valentine 's day last year has never been in doubt , but the why has been tested over and over again .
Legal analysts say Pistorius , a double amputee sprinter who starred at the 2012 London Olympics , has hurt his case by appearing to offer two different defences .
He testified that he feared an intruder was coming through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria and that his life was in danger when he shot four lethally expanding bullets in quick succession .
He also testified that he fired accidentally as a result of deep - seated anxiety caused by his disability and did not mean to kill anyone .
The trial was never more dramatic than when prosecutor Gerrie Nel cross - examined Pistorius over five days , beginning his questioning by forcing the weeping athlete to look at gruesome images of Steenkamp 's bloodied head which , the prosecutor claimed , "" exploded like a watermelon "" .
Nel , dubbed "" the pitbull "" , accused Pistorius of refusing to take responsibility for his actions , taunting : "" You will blame anybody but yourself . ""
The prosecution will submit its written argument on 30 July , the defence on 4 August .
Nel , citing witnesses who say they heard a woman 's "" bloodcurdling screams "" , will assert that Pistorius killed Steenkamp during an argument .
Roux will contend that a timeline of phone records from that night proves otherwise , and the screams were those of Pistorius .
After weeks of conjecture about what was inside Pistorius 's head at the time of the shooting , attention will now switch to what judge Thokozile Masipa is thinking .
If she reaches a verdict of murder , the athlete faces up to 25 years in jail .
She could opt for the lesser conviction of culpable homicide .
Pistorius has also pleaded not guilty to three other charges connected with the reckless discharge of a firearm and the illegal possession of ammunition .
Antony Altbeker , a criminologist and author , believes this was a "" catastrophic "" mistake . ""
A lot of the question revolves around Oscar 's credibility
and I do n't think he did himself any favours with the legal strategies he adopted , "" said Altbeker .
"" The judge has to believe Oscar has taken her into his confidence .
He 's done the exact opposite and I think he 'll live to regret that .
"" We know he shot Reeva , the question is why .
The only person who can answer that is Oscar himself .
He 's left room for doubt about whether he 'll tell the whole truth .
I think the default conviction is murder .
It takes a lot of imagination to see things Oscar 's way . """
2014-07-14,"Oscar Pistorius has broken a lengthy public silence by tweeting a Bible verse , pictures of his charity work with disabled children and the words of an Auschwitz concentration camp survivor .
The Paralympian 's trial for the killing of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp is currently adjourned until final arguments next month .
He denies murder , insisting that he shot four times through a toilet door after mistaking her for a burglar at his home in Pretoria .
Pistorius posted on his Twitter account on 13 February 2013 , the day before the tragedy , and on 14 February 2014 , its first anniversary .
Since then he had been silent , until Sunday .
One tweet contains a set of seven photos of the athlete smiling as he interacts with children with disabilities , including a young girl who is wearing prosthetic legs like his own .
A caption reads : "" You have the ability to make a difference in someones [ sic ] life .
Sometimes it 's the simple things you say or do that can make someone feel better or inspire them . ""
In April , Pistorius talked about his humanitarian work during his evidence - in - chief at the murder trial .
He recalled taking on able - bodied runners in Mozambique to give confidence to people maimed by landmines .
He said his work in developing prostheses led to Strathclyde University awarding him an honorary doctorate .
In another tweet on Sunday , Pistorius posted a photograph of his finger resting on a page from Victor Frankl 's memoir , Man 's Search for Meaning , in which the Austrian psychiatrist recounts his time as a prisoner at Auschwitz during the Holocaust .
The extract reads in part : "" The salvation of man is through love and in love .
I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss , be it only for a brief moment , in the contemplation of his beloved . ""
In a position of utter desolation , when man can not express himself in positive action , when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way â€ “ an honourable way â€ “ in such a position man
can , through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved , achieve fulfilment .
"" On Monday Pistorius tweeted : "" Lord , today I ask that you bathe those who live in pain in the river of your healing .
Amen , "" with an image of sunset on a river .
Earlier he tweeted a verse from the Bible : "" The Lord is close to the brokenhearted , "" from Psalm 34:18 .
It is no longer visible on his Twitter stream but was retweeted by his brother Carl .
Pistorius and his family are known to be devout Christians and to have drawn strength from their faith during the trial .
A psychological report based on a 30-day evaluation of Pistorius noted that he prayed every day and held regular prayer and Bible discussion groups at his home .
It said he had an elevated risk of suicide but "" his religious beliefs and his strong family ties currently mediate against this possibility "" .
Experts said there was no legal objection to Pistorius tweeting before the prosecution and defence 's closing arguments on 7 and 8 August .
Dario Milo , a media lawyer , told the South African Press Association : "" There is no prohibition on Oscar making public statements , whether via Twitter or otherwise .
He is perfectly entitled to do so and there can be no suggestion that he is in contempt of court .
In any event , his comments on Twitter have nothing at all to do with the case . """
2014-07-15,"Oscar Pistorius has been involved in an altercation at a nightclub , days after his lawyers wound up their defence in his murder trial .
His spokeswoman , Anneliese Burgess , said the athlete was in a booth in the VIP section of a club in Johannesburg 's upmarket Sandton district when a man "" started to aggressively interrogate him on matters relating to the trial â€ ¦ an argument ensued in which my client asked to be left alone .
Oscar and his cousin left soon afterwards .
Oscar regrets the decision to go to a public place and thereby invite unwelcome attention . ""
Burgess said the other man "" has now been identified as a Mr Mortimer "" .
South Africa 's Star newspaper named him as businessman Jared Mortimer , who offered a different version of the events of Saturday night and claimed Pistorius was drunk .
Mortimer said he reacted after Pistorius , who is free on bail , made disparaging comments about Mortimer 's friends and the family of President Jacob Zuma .
"" I took that personally because I am very good friends with a member of the Zuma family , "" Mortimer was quoted as saying .
He added that Pistorius was intoxicated and started getting aggressive . ""
He was poking me and saying that I would never get the better of him .
He was close to my face and at that point I pushed him to get him away from me
â€ “
and he fell to the ground .
"" The club , The VIP Room , was hosting an exclusive birthday party called the Superhero Squad and many of the guests wore superhero costumes .
The club 's website says it caters to the "" nouveau riche "" and invites guests to "" slip on your diamante dancing shoes or designer suit and dance the night away at the most ostentatious venue in Joburg "" .
The club manager insisted "" everything is being blown out of proportion '' .
Perry Mermigas told South Africa 's Times newspaper : "" I was sitting with him [ Pistorius ] and his cousin at their table .
They were there for an hour and there was definitely no ' altercation ' as this person is making out . ""
He was chilling with his cousin , nothing more and nothing less .
If there was something , like what is being described , we would definitely have got involved .
What I can say is that Oscar was at the club and left , like any other normal patrons , after an hour . ""
On Sunday , hours after the incident , Pistorius tweeted for the first time in five months , posting a Bible verse , a collage of pictures of his humanitarian work and an extract from Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl 's book Man 's Search for Meaning .
The 27-year - old is accused of the murder of his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , at his upmarket home , in Pretoria last year .
The double amputee known as the Blade Runner says he killed Steenkamp after mistaking her for an intruder hiding in the toilet next to his bedroom .
During the trial which opened in early March , the prosecution argued Pistorius often lost his temper and killed Steenkamp during a row .
The case was adjourned until 7 August for legal teams to prepare closing arguments .
On Tuesday night Pistorius 's uncle admitted that the athlete is suffering increasing loneliness and alienation and this is leading to "" self - harming behaviour "" .
Leo Pistorius was responding to coverage of the nightclub incident that featured on South African newspaper front pages and TV news bulletins .
"" Some of the outrageous claims simply can not stand uncorrected , "" he said .
"" Whilst Oscar venturing out into a public space with his cousin in the current climate and whilst his court case is still underway was unwise , those of us closest to him have been witness to his escalating sense of loneliness and alienation .
This , we believe , is underlying some of his self - harming behaviour .
As a family we are counselling Oscar to find ways of dealing with his feelings of isolation . ""
Leo went on to challenge Mortimer 's widely publicised account of the confrontation . ""
At the same time , however , we can not allow one man 's untrue version of what happened to stand unchallenged , "" he said .
"" Mr Mortimer , who has been unknown to Oscar and our family until he approached the press with his story of the so - called ' altercation ' in which he has cast himself as the victim , is a man peddling untruths designed for maximum attention and maximum damage .
"" We wish to categorically state that there is absolutely no truth to this man 's assertions that Oscar , for instance , insulted the president of South Africa or boasted about our family 's so - called influence .
Nor is the bizarre statement that our family ' owns the SANDF ' [ South African National Defence Force ] . ""
He added : "" Oscar was at school with one of President Zuma 's sons and liked him a lot .
Oscar also has great appreciation of President Zuma 's extraordinary support of the Paralympians .
"" The statement concluded : "" Both Oscar and his cousin were equally taken aback by Mr Mortimer 's accusations relating to the trial .
My investigations indicate that Mortimer was the aggressor and eyewitnesses confirm this .
"" Being in a public space such as this , and thereby putting himself in a place where this kind of confrontation could take place , was ill considered .
We do however believe that Oscar is grappling with an extreme level of emotional pain that is manifesting itself in some of his recent unwise actions and choices . """
2014-08-02,"Oscar Pistorius 's brother has been badly hurt in a head - on collision in South Africa , his uncle said .
Carl Pistorius was taken to a hospital in Pretoria after the crash on Friday and was now out of danger , said Arnold Pistorius .
"" Carl 's vehicle was hit head - on by another car that had swerved from the opposite side of the highway into the oncoming traffic , "" he said .
South African media reported that Carl had sustained multiple fractures and would undergo surgery .
The television station eNCA said he was in an intensive care unit with fractures to his right arm , leg and left foot .
Another South African media outlet said he was in a critical condition .
His uncle said Carl had been returning from a business trip in Polokwane , about 160 miles north of Pretoria .
The crash was witnessed by a colleague who was travelling in another vehicle behind Carl 's .
Last year , Carl Pistorius was acquitted of a charge of culpable homicide over a road accident in 2008 in which a female motorcyclist died .
In that crash , the motorcyclist collided with the back of Carl 's SUV .
Oscar Pistorius has been on trial since 3 March accused of intentionally killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp , whom he shot on Valentine 's Day last year .
Prosecution and defence lawyers will present their final arguments in the trial this week .
The 27-year - old athlete could face 25 years to life in prison if convicted of premeditated murder .
He could also face jail time if convicted of murder without premeditation or negligent killing .
The defendant claims he killed Steenkamp by mistake , thinking she was a nighttime intruder in his home when he shot multiple times through a closed toilet door ."
2014-08-07,"You can read the full version of the stateâ€ ™ s heads of argument ( or closing argument ) here : Hereâ€ ™ s my report on what we saw in the Pretoria high court today .
Iâ€ ™ ll have more on the live blog on Friday morning .
Oscar Pistorius must be found guilty of the premeditated murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp , South African prosecutors have said , as the athleteâ€ ™ s testimony was dismissed as mendacious and â€œdevoid of truthâ€ � .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel , making his closing argument for the state , said the defence claim that Pistorius believed there was an intruder in his house on the night of 14 February 2013 would not help him escape conviction : â€œI know there is a human being behind that door .
I mean to kill that person
and I do so .
That it turned out to be Reeva is [ legally ] of no consequence.â€ � Defence lawyers , Nel said , are set to argue that Pistorius acted in self - defence , faced with a perceived intruder , but also that he fired involuntarily because he was startled .
â€œItâ€
™ s two defences that you can never reconcile , â€ � Nel told the judge , Thokozile Masipa , who will retire on Friday to consider her verdict .
There is no jury .
At the high court in Pretoria , Nel repeatedly accused Pistorius of tailoring his evidence , saying that contested claims about the location of a duvet and two fans in the athleteâ€ ™ s bedroom and inconsistencies in his version of events on the night were the consequence of a â€œsnowball effect of liesâ€ � .
â€œThe court should have no difficulty in rejecting his full version of events , not only as not reasonably possibly true , but in essence as being absolutely devoid of any truth , â€ � Nel told the court .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a snowball effect of lies .
You tell one and it becomes too much .
You just have to keep going and going.â€ �
The prosecution contends that â€ “ contrary to Pistoriusâ€ ™ claim that the couple went to bed at 10 pm
â€ “
the pair were in fact awake and arguing .
A witness says she heard a row , and Steenkampâ€ ™ s stomach contents indicate she was awake and eating at around 1 am , Nel said .
Neighbours heard â€œinterminglingâ€ � screams of a man and a woman before the four gunshots .
Barry Roux , for the defence , will make his main closing argument on Friday .
But he took advantage of an extension to the court day on Thursday to point out what he called â€œmistakesâ€ � in the stateâ€ ™ s version .
He told the court that the original investigating officer , Hilton Botha , told â€œblatant liesâ€ � and argued that police had moved crucial evidence at the scene , saying the defence would show the judge a photograph of one of the officers with his hand on a plug .
Fridayâ€ ™ s hearing is likely to focus on the timeline of events around the shooting , amid claims by Roux that the stateâ€ ™
s case â€œtakes a nosediveâ€ � over the timing of the gunshots .
The state says the four shots were fired at 3.17am ; the defence says this noise was the cricket bat breaking down the toilet door , and earlier sounds heard by neighbours were the shots .
The state has not provided an alternative explanation for the earlier noises , but its argument that neighbours heard female screams rests on the fatal shots being fired no earlier than 3.17am .
The court has heard that Steenkamp would have been unable to cry out once she had been shot .
For the first time since the trial began in March , the fathers of Pistorius and Steenkamp were in the Pretoria courthouse .
Pistorius is said to be estranged from his father , Henke , and Steenkampâ€ ™ s father , Barry , has been ill .
Pistorius is also charged with other offences of discharging a firearm in a public place and illegal possession of ammunition .
These , argues the state , show a pattern of behaviour in which the athlete acts recklessly and does not take responsibility for his actions .
Pistorius denies all the charges .
The court has heard the closing arguments by the prosecution that Oscar Pistorius should be found guilty of all four charges against him â€ “ principally that the judge should find that he is responsible for the premeditated murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on 14 February last year :
Fetching the gun and walking down the corridor to the bathroom with it indicates premeditation , the state claims : He had lots of time for reflection .
He made up his mind in the bedroom when he armed himself .
That is pre - planning .
Lead counsel for the state , Gerrie Nel , said Pistorius was an â€œappalling witnessâ€ � whose testimony had been â€œdevoid of truthâ€ � , vague , argumentative and mendacious .
He does not have an anxiety disorder but does have â€œanxiety on - callâ€
� , he said :
The accused is more interested in fending for his life than in entrusting the court with a truthful account .
The prosecutor highlighted what he called significant incongruities in the defence case , arguing that conflicting evidence about the position of fans and a duvet in the accusedâ€ ™ s bedroom proved Pistorius was tailoring his evidence to mask the fact that he knew it was Steenkamp in the toilet cubicle when he fired four shots through the door .
There is no proof the police tampered with the crime scene , Nel said .
The position of items in the bedroom means Pistoriusâ€ ™ version can not be true .
Regardless of who was behind the door , Pistorius is guilty of murder , Nel argued .
He said the court could not escape the conclusion that , whether Pistorius believed the person behind the door was an intruder or knew it was Steenkamp , it was murder by dolus directus ( premeditated murder ) or dolus eventualis ( that he must have known he was likely to kill the person by firing ) .
He meant to fire and he aimed at the person in the cubicle : I know there is a human being behind that door .
I mean to kill that person
and I do so .
That it turned out to be Reeva is [ legally ] of no consequence .
But Nel insisted Pistorius knew it was Steenkamp .
She was facing the door when he fired directly at her â€ “ not wild shooting , but a â€œgood groupingâ€ � of four shots .
He said WhatsApp messages between the pair show they were having problems , with Steenkamp saying she was â€œscaredâ€ � of her boyfriend : This was not a normal relationship .
This relationship ended in death .
The prosecution contends that the pair were arguing .
A witness says she heard a row , another saw the bathroom light on and Steenkampâ€ ™ s stomach contents indicate she was awake and eating several hours after Pistorius said they had gone to sleep : Nobody went to bed in that house .
Nobody was sleeping .
Nel pointed out that the defence did not call witnesses to substantiate claims that Pistorius sounds like a woman when he screams .
By contrast , state witnesses who said they heard a woman showed â€œextraordinary corroborationâ€ � in their independent statements to police .
Witnesses also heard â€œinterminglingâ€ � screams of a man and a woman .
Nel says Pistoriusâ€ ™ team has claimed two defences : that the accused did not have criminal capacity in the heat of the moment ; but that if the court finds that he did have capacity , that he acted in self - defence .
They can not both be true .
The other charges faced , and denied , by Pistorius show a pattern of behaviour in which the athlete acts recklessly and does not take responsibility for his actions , the state argues .
Barry Roux , for the defence , will make his main closing argument on Friday .
But he took advantage of an extension to the court day today to point out what he called â€œmistakesâ€ � in the stateâ€ ™ s version .
The defence says the original investigating officer , Hilton Botha , told â€œblatant liesâ€ � and argues that police moved crucial evidence at the scene .
Roux said the stateâ€ ™ s case â€œtakes a nosediveâ€ � over the issue of the first noises heard by neighbours ( see below for more on this ) .
The state says the four shots were fired at 3.17am ; the defence says this noise was the cricket bat on the door , and earlier sounds heard by neighbours were the shots .
The state has not explained what it thinks the earlier noises were , but its evidence on the female screams hinges on the shots being the later noises , as Steenkamp could not have continued to scream after she was shot .
The timeline will make up a significant part of the defence argument .
Judge Thokozile Masipa received assurances from both sides that the arguments will conclude on Friday .
She will then give the court an indication of when she will return with her verdict .
Thatâ€ ™ s it for the live blog for today .
Thank you for reading .
The live blog will be back on Friday for rolling coverage of the defence closing argument .
Associated Press has filed this report on Gerrie Nelâ€ ™ s claim that Oscar Pistorius was an â€œappalling witnessâ€ � who â€œrepeatedly lied in his testimony in a crude attempt to defend himselfâ€ � .
The Guardian video team has put together this summary of the prosecutionâ€ ™ s closing argument , as Gerrie Nel argues that Pistorius is â€˜vacillatingâ€ ™ between two contradictory lines of defence : Roux says he liked the neighbours who testified for the state but realised some of their evidence did not stack up against objective facts .
There is a difference between reliability and credibility .
Roux takes a break ; thatâ€ ™ s it from court for today .
Masipa says court will adjourn until 9.30am ( 8.30am BST ) on Friday morning ( Roux wonâ€ ™ t get the early start he suggested ) .
I will post a summary shortly .
Roux says that for the state to rely on circumstantial evidence , it must say this evidence points to only one reasonable inference , and must not exclude other reasonable possibilities .
But he says objective evidence does not fit the state version .
Even if the shots were the second set of noises , at 3.17am , Roux says , Pistorius would not have had time to do all the things the state says he did before help arrived .
The immediate neighbours who were witnesses for the defence were good witnesses , he says .
They said the screaming came from a man with a high - pitched voice .
Roux says the state is unable to deal with this material evidence .
Roux says he will take the court through the timeline on Friday to show that the stateâ€ ™ s version of events does not add up .
Back to the night of the shooting .
If itâ€ ™ s the stateâ€ ™ s case that the couple were downstairs at 1 am , eating and arguing , how does that fit with the stateâ€ ™ s argument that she â€œhurriedlyâ€ � got rid of her jeans and fled to the toilet ?
( These are the jeans that were photographed by police on top of the duvet on the floor . )
It canâ€ ™ t be true that Steenkamp was both making â€œbloodcurling , petrified screamsâ€ � and also standing behind the bathroom door talking to Pistorius , he says .
The stateâ€ ™ s versions do not reconcile .
He says the state was forced to change his case after evidence proved that Steenkamp could not have screamed after she was shot .
They then had to say the second set of noises were the shots , he says , as otherwise the evidence of female screaming did not fit the stateâ€ ™ s case .
But the defence insists the second set were the cricket bat .
The state does not have an explanation for the first set of noises that the defence says were the shots .
Of the incident in Tashas restaurant , when the loaded gun went off , Roux says Pistorius admitted he was â€œnegligentâ€ � .
But witnesses who were there said he apologised and said it was a mistake .
On the illegal ammunition , Roux says the firearms act stipulates it must be kept in a safe , but does not specify that it must be your own safe .
Roux turns to the extension cord â€ “ the state says it could not have reached to where Pistorius said he moved the fan .
The cord went missing from the scene , which Masipa declared herself very unhappy about .
Roux says the defence does now have a photo that shows the cord was long enough to reach to the end of the bed , where Pistorius says he put it .
Moreover , says Roux , Van Rensburg told the court he did not touch anything in the room , but there is a photo of him with his hand on a plug .
Weâ€ ™ re not saying conspiracy but
weâ€ ™ re saying the scene was disturbed .
It is wrong for the state to call Pistorius a liar , Roux argues .
Roux also takes issue with Nelâ€ ™ s claim that he only once called Pistorius a liar .
He reads a list of pages from the transcript in which he says Nel told the accused he was lying .
And he also queries
Nelâ€ ™ s claim that he was not obliged to call all witnesses on the stateâ€ ™ s list .
He says an Staden and Van Rensburg did their best to create the impression that they worked alone upstairs , even though the state was in possession of affidavits from other police officers who were there .
We know that Hilton Botha was the investigating officer .
We also know â€ ¦ that he told blatant lies to incriminate the accused â€ ¦
And we know he was in the bedroom .
( Botha was sacked after being charged with seven counts of attempted murder himself . )
Roux says the defence is not claiming there was a conspiracy by police officers to tamper with the scene , but they messed up : things were moved .
He says perhaps officers came into the room , the fan was in the way , they moved it .
Nel has accused Pistorius of lying about going out on to the balcony to call for help , because police photos show fans in front of the balcony door .
But , says Roux , Van Rensburg says he walked out on to the balcony when he arrived at the scene .
( Police officers have already been accused of stealing Pistoriusâ€ ™ watches . )
The defence lawyer now takes issue with Nelâ€ ™ s argument that the other firearms charges and the WhatsApp messages show a continuum in behaviour leading up to the death of Steenkamp .
He is also angered by Nelâ€ ™ s dismissal of Pistoriusâ€ ™ anxiety .
An anxious person does not show his vulnerability all the time , he says : it comes to the fore in the face of a threat .
Evidence from a psychologist spoke of â€œtwo Oscarsâ€
� â€ “ one a vulnerable and fearful person with a disability , the other a confident Olympic hero .
Roux says he will begin by pointing out â€œmaterial mistakesâ€ � in the stateâ€ ™ s closing argument .
He says he was waiting for the state to tell the court what were the first noises heard by neighbours ( see below for more on this ) .
The state says shots were fired at 3.17am ; the defence says this noise was the cricket bat on the door , and earlier sounds were the shots .
The state has not explained what it thinks the earlier noises were .
Roux says the state has tried to ignore this discrepancy because it would prompt a â€œnosediveâ€ � in its case .
Barry Roux , for the defence , suggests the court start earlier tomorrow , at 9 am ( 8 am BST ) in order to ensure closing arguments are concluded by the end of Friday .
He also reminds that judge that the state does not have a right to reply to the defence argument on facts , only on points of law .
Masipa agrees that the court can sit for another half an hour now for Roux to begin .
Nel says Pistorius should be convicted on all charges , and that he should be found guilty of murder with premeditation .
And thatâ€ ™ s it for the prosecutionâ€ ™ s closing arguments .
Nel turns to what premeditation means .
It does not have to mean sitting down and planning , he says .
Fetching the gun and walking down the corridor to the bathroom with it indicates premeditation :
He had lots of time for reflection .
He made up his mind in the bedroom when he armed himself .
That is pre - planning .
Even if the court decides to accept the case by the defence about Pistoriusâ€ ™ anxiety and vulnerabilities , says Nel , he can not escape a conviction for culpable homicide .
No reasonable man would have acted as he did .
The court can not accept that a person can fire without cause into a locked door .
It would have been different and that door had opened and he fired â€ ¦ but we donâ€ ™ t have that .
Nel says the indictment against Pistorius was that he intended to kill a human being .
This was dolus directus ( premeditated murder ) , whether it was Reeva Steenkamp or an intruder .
If the court does not decide it was premeditated , Nel goes on : The court can not escape that it was murder by dolus eventualis .
That is , by firing four shots into the door , he must have known he was likely to kill the person behind it .
He is guilty of murder .
Pistorius dropped the baton , Nel says : he is disqualified from the race â€ “ and disqualified himself from having his version accepted by the court .
He canâ€ ™ t blame anyone but himself .
A conviction for murder with dolus directus [ premeditation ] is inevitable .
Even if Pistorius thought it was an intruder , firing the four shots through the closed door is murder .
There is no imminent attack .
He is armed .
Why would it not be dolus directus , Nel asks the judge ?
Next , Nel turns to count four : illegal possession of ammunition for which he didnâ€ ™ t have a licence .
Pistorius claimed it belonged to his father , Henke , but his father â€ “ from whom the athlete is estranged â€ “ did not provide an affidavit .
Nel says this is not a viable offence .
It was in Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ safe , the prosecutor says : if you are in possession of it , itâ€ ™ s yours .
Donâ€ ™ t you need animus ( motive to use the ammunition ) , Judge Masipa asks .
Nel says no : possession is enough to convict .
Pistorius did not have a permit .
He is guilty .
Nel says the witnesses to the alleged car sunroof incident , Samantha Taylor and Darren Fresco , did not conspire to fabricate a story .
There are contradictions between their accounts , Nel concedes , but they agree that Pistorius fired the gun .
It is further proof that Pistorius fails to take responsibility for his actions , Nel argues .
He says the other allegation relating to discharging a firearm â€ “ in which Pistorius claims he was passed a loaded gun and it went off without him pulling the trigger â€ “ adds to this .
Nel says he will quickly turn to the other charges â€ “ you can see the full detail of the charges against Pistorius here .
In brief , the state says he fired a gun through a car sunroof and in a separate incident at Tashaâ€ ™ s restaurant ; he is also accused of illegal possession of ammunition .
Judge Masipa intervenes :
Can you really rely on these WhatsApp messages ?
Can you really make an inference one way or the other ?
Arenâ€ ™ t relationships dynamic ?
If youâ€ ™ re unhappy today , it doesnâ€
™ t mean you wonâ€
™ t be happy the next day .
Nel says there is no dispute that Steenkamp sent the messages .
The court must interpret them as they were written so close to the time she was killed .
The couple was not without problems : This was not a normal relationship .
This relationship ended in death .
Nel turns to the relationship between Pistorius and Steenkamp .
We were lucky enough to have the deceasedâ€ ™ s view of this relationship , by means of the WhatsApps â€ ¦ talking about their relationship .
The defence would say 90 % of all those messages â€ ¦ boo - boo , bah bah , kiss kiss kiss â€ ¦
Itâ€ ™ s true , they were there .
But itâ€ ™ s the 10 % that matters .
Itâ€ ™ s like saying you have cancer in your lungs but itâ€ ™ s only a small part of your body .
Itâ€ ™ s that 10 % that counts .
The timing is important , Nel says .
Less than three weeks before the murder , Steenkamp said she was scared of Pistorius .
Hereâ€ ™ s an excerpt of her message , which Nel is reading to the court : You have picked on me excessively â€
¦
I do everything to make you happy and you do everything to throw tantrums .
Iâ€
™ m scared of you sometimes and how you snap at me and of how you will react to me .
You make me happy 90 % of the time
and I think we are amazing together
â€
¦
but I am not some other bitch
â€ ¦ trying to kill your vibe â€ ¦ Iâ€ ™ m the girl who fell in love with you but Iâ€ ™ m also the girl who gets side
- stepped when you are in a shit mood
â€
¦ I get snapped at and told my accent and voices are annoying .
Nel says the affidavit by Steenkampâ€ ™ s friend Sam Greyvenstein is untested and should be disregarded .
Nel says that if the court accepts that Steenkamp ate two hours before she died , Pistoriusâ€ ™ version can never be accepted .
( Itâ€ ™ s worth pointing out that Perumal and the defence team said he was not available for the trial dates . )
The defence called anaesthetist Professor Christina Lundgren , who said stomach emptying was not an exact science .
But Lundgren did not know until cross - examination that there was 200ml of food in Steenkampâ€ ™ s stomach when she died , meaning â€ “ if she had eaten several hours earlier , rather than two â€ “
she must have eaten a meal of 2 litres of food .
Itâ€ ™ s not good enough for the defence to talk about possibilities , Nel says , when the evidence suggests Steenkamp ate between 1 am and 3.17am .
Nel pours praise on the testimony of Professor Gert Saayman , whose analysis of Steenkampâ€ ™ s stomach contents indicated she had eaten about two hours before her death .
That would suggest she was awake at around 1 am , consistent with the neighbour who heard arguing .
There were no plates in the bedroom , Nel says : Steenkamp was up and awake .
Pistorius claims the couple went to bed around 10 pm .
Nel turns to the evidence of another neighbour , Estelle van der Merwe , who said she heard an argument at 1.56am .
In Pistoriusâ€ ™ version of events , he and Steenkamp were asleep at this time .
There is dispute between the state and defence over the precise timing of the gun shots , the cricket bat against the door and the screams : Nel says the screaming started â€œmomentsâ€ � after the first sounds heard by witnesses : he says this was the first gunshot .
The screaming finished when the gunshots ended .
But , says Nel , Pistorius claimed he screamed at the â€œintruderâ€ � to get out of his house .
But nobody heard this .
Anette Stipp was awake and did not hear that .
Nel shows the court a photo of the view from the bedroom of the witness â€ “ Anette Stipp â€ “ who says she saw the light on in the bathroom of Pistoriusâ€ ™ house .
It shows a clear line of sight to the window .
Nobody went to bed in that house .
Nobody was sleeping .
The balcony wasnâ€ ™ t closed .
The alarm wasnâ€ ™ t activated and that [ bathroom ] light was on .
If the light was on , the accusedâ€ ™ s version can not be accepted .
If he fired the shots while the lights were on , his version can never be accepted .
Nel is hammering home his point about the credibility and truthfulness of the neighbours who testified for the state ( defence counsel Barry Roux was rather ruthless in his cross - examination of them and implied there had been some collaboration ) .
He makes a virtue of some of the inconsistencies â€ “ one witness thought heâ€ ™ d heard more than four shots ; another saw a light in the bathroom window , while her husband didnâ€ ™ t
â€ “ saying this shows there was no coaching of witnesses : they just wanted to tell the court what they remembered .
Nel says that witnesses for the state who heard screams and shots on the night had told their friends before they knew who the accused was ; this adds credibility , he says .
Burger also said there was a pause between the first and second gun shot , before the others followed rapidly .
Her evidence â€œcorresponds 100%â€ � with that of Captain Mangena , who reconstructed the scene for the state .
If it had been rapid fire , as the defence claims , the second shot ( B ) would have hit Steenkamp as she fell .
But it didnâ€ ™ t , Nel said .
This makes the version supplied by Burger and Mangena more convincing .
( The defence disputes the order of some of the shots . )
Nel says that Pistorius insisted he had fired the four shots as rapid fire .
If he can recall this , he can not claim a defence of automatism , says Nel : he knew what he was doing .
That was a short lunch break .
Nel starts by admitting an error
â€ “ he did in fact ask Pistorius about the phone charger .
Pistorius told the court he did not know who had put the phone on to charge in the kitchen downstairs .
The court is midway through the closing arguments for the prosecution , led by lead counsel for the state , Gerrie Nel .
Nel said Oscar Pistorius was an â€œappalling witnessâ€ � whose testimony had been â€œdevoid of truthâ€ � , vague , argumentative and mendacious .
He does not have an anxiety disorder but does have â€œanxiety on - callâ€
�
: The accused is more interested in fending for his life than in entrusting the court with a truthful account .
The prosecutor said he had identified at least 13 significant incongruities in the defence case ( though he abandoned the numbering system mid - morning , so it is unclear how far through these we are now ) .
He said conflicting evidence about the position of fans and a duvet in the accusedâ€ ™ s bedroom showed how Pistorius was tailoring his evidence to mask the fact that he knew it was Steenkamp in the toilet cubicle when he fired four shots through the door .
There is no proof the police tampered with the crime scene , Nel says .
The position of items in the bedroom means Pistoriusâ€ ™ version can not be true .
Regardless of who was behind the door , Pistorius is guilty of murder , Nel argued .
It is still murder to shoot four times at a perceived intruder when there is no imminent attack .
He meant to fire and he aimed at the person in the cubicle : I know there is a human being behind that door .
I mean to kill that person
and I do so .
That it turned out to be Reeva is [ legally ] of no consequence .
But Nel insisted Pistorius knew it was Steenkamp behind the door and there was no perceived intruder .
She was facing the door when he fired directly at her â€ “ not wild shooting , but a â€œgood groupingâ€ � of four shots .
The defence failed to call any witnesses to substantiate claims that Pistorius sounds like a woman when he screams .
By contrast , state witnesses who said they heard a woman showed â€œextraordinary corroborationâ€ � in their independent statements to police .
Nel says Pistoriusâ€ ™ team has claimed two defences : that the accused did not have criminal capacity in the heat of the moment ; but that if the court finds that he did have capacity , that he acted in self - defence .
They can not both be true .
Just a half - hour break .
I will try to post a brief summary before the court comes back .
Nel moves on to the state witnesses and what they said about screaming .
( He has abandoned his numbering system so Iâ€ ™ m not sure which of the 13 incongruities we are up to now . )
The state witnesses were independent .
They did not know each other .
They did not know the accused or the deceased .
And yet the level of corroboration in their statements is â€œexceptionalâ€
� .
They came to court with no other intention but to tell the truth â€ ¦ They remained steadfast .
The defence version that the accused can scream like a woman and the cricket bat sounds like a gun shot is not proven at all .
Citing case law , Nel says it is not possible to make a defence that , having armed oneself and acted in a â€œgoal - directedâ€ � manner , one is not in control of oneâ€ ™ s actions .
The shooting was not involuntary , he tells the judge .
Nel says it is impossible for the court to accept that Pistorius was not in control of himself only at the point at which he fired the shots .
He armed himself , approached the perceived threat and fired four shots .
He was â€œgoal - directedâ€ � , even on his own account .
There was no perceived intruder , Nel says .
Tearing into defence witness Wayne Derman ( the South African Paralympic team doctor ) now , Nel says his evidence about Pistorius reacting to a â€œstartleâ€ � should not be accepted by the court .
â€œAny proper expertâ€ � would have questioned the accused about what he thought the noise was , Nel says .
Nel says that the so - called second startle â€ “ the slamming of the toilet door â€ “ shows that Pistorius knew someone was in there before he fired shots .
Nel says Pistorius became emotional in court when asked about shouting at the perceived intruder to get out of house because he had in fact been screaming at Steenkamp .
Itâ€ ™ s improbable that all the screaming heard by witnesses came from Pistorius alone , Nel continues .
He is dismissive of the claim by the defence â€ “ for which it called no witnesses â€ “ that neighbours who heard a woman screaming in fact heard Pistorius .
We distinguish between male and female voices every day , Nel points out .
Nel says the screaming stopped after the last blow by the cricket bat to break down the toilet door .
If it were Pistorius screaming , this makes no sense :
wouldnâ€ ™ t he scream more when he saw Steenkamp lying there ?
The screaming stopped because it was Steenkamp who had been screaming , Nel tells the court .
It would have made the stateâ€ ™ s case harder if Pistorius had emptied his gun into the toilet door , Nel says : it would fit his claim that he â€œjust firedâ€ � after a startle .
But there were just four shots , grouped shots aimed at the toilet bowl .
The shots were â€œfired by someone who was in controlâ€ � .
He knew where she was standing .
Nel attacks two of the defence witnesses , Roger Dixon and Thomas Wolmarans , who testified about the gun shots and forensic issues .
He says he has never seen worse witnesses testify in the high court .
Nel says there was no sound of the magazine rack moving before Pistorius fired .
The rack moved when Steenkamp fell on it after the first shot hit her , he says .
Nel turns to the issue of the wooden magazine rack in the toilet cubicle , pointing out inconsistencies in the evidence of Pistorius and Derman over whether the rack moving provided the â€œstartleâ€ � that prompted the athlete to fire .
Pistorius himself seemed to dismiss this in his testimony , saying it was his belief that the door was about to open that prompted him to shoot .
Nel says the court has to accept many unlikely things in order to adopt Pistoriusâ€ ™ version of events .
He said he did not mean to fire at anyone â€ “ that means he can not claim self - defence ( â€œprivate
defenceâ€ � ) , Nel argues .
The court has to reject it .
Nel says Steenkamp was standing right behind the toilet door .
She was talking to Pistorius , he claims .
She was not scared of an intruder .
She knows that the person who is the danger is standing in front of her .
Pistorius claims he heard the noise of the bathroom window opening .
Why would Steenkamp open it at 3 am when she was going to the toilet , Nel asks .
He says it did not happen .
Why did she take her cellphone with her to the toilet , he says .
Why would she get up to go to the toilet and not speak to Pistorius ?
Why , when Pistorius was apparently screaming at an intruder , did she not say a word ?
On the putative self - defence line , Nel says he will not spend much time on this .
There was no imminent attack on the accused â€ “ even the defence would accept that , he says .
There was nothing tangible , says Nel : the toilet door was not opening .
Even on the accusedâ€ ™ s version , there was nothing more than a sound .
Dolus eventualis would mean he armed himself and fired in the knowledge that his actions might result in someoneâ€ ™ s death .
It is still murder if Pistorius intended to shoot and kill an intruder , Nel says .
It was not a deflected blow .
He meant to shoot the person in the bathroom .
I know there is a human being behind that door .
I mean to kill that person
and I do so .
That it turned out to be Reeva is [ legally ] of no consequence .
Why did Pistorius , after shooting Steenkamp , deactivate his security alarm and go downstairs to put his phone on to charge , Nel asks .
It shows he had a plan .
He was not panicking .
Or that he was lying : the alarm was not on , because Pistorius and Steenkamp were still awake , having an argument .
The phone charger was downstairs .
When Pistorius carried Steenkamp downstairs , witness Carine Viljoen and he then tended to her wounds .
He did not put the phone on a charger at that time , so he must already have done that , Nel says , between the shooting and the carrying of Steenkamp .
Masipa queries whether Pistorius was ever asked about when he charged his phone .
He was not .
But the charger was in the kitchen .
The prosecutor now questions why Pistorius didnâ€ ™ t state in his bail application that he spoke to Steenkamp after waking up , and then said in the trial that he did .
Nel says all the couples who came to the trial as witnesses testified that they spoke to each other when they heard the sounds of screaming from the Pistorius house .
Yet Pistorius himself did not mention at all to Steenkamp the sound he said he heard .
With a previous girlfriend , Samantha Taylor , he woke her up when he heard a noise in the night .
Pistorius then , according to his version , spoke to Steenkamp â€œin a soft mannerâ€ � before approaching the apparent danger .
He had earlier said heâ€ ™ d whispered , but later rejected â€œwhisperâ€ � and insisted on â€œsoft mannerâ€ � .
Nel says this is because whispering implies closeness and Pistorius had to maintain he didnâ€
™ t know Steenkamp had got out of bed , so needed to suggest he was not close to her .
Nel says itâ€ ™ s impossible that Steenkampâ€ ™ s jeans would have ended up on top of the duvet if the duvet was not already on the floor .
This is the straw that breaks the camelâ€ ™ s back in terms of the accusedâ€ ™ s tailoring of his evidence , Nel says .
Nel said Pistorius lied about covering the blue LED light on the amplifier because his version relied on him having his back to the bed so he would not see Steenkamp get up .
Why would he bother to cover the light ?
It never happened , Nel says .
Nel is back to his list of 13 incongruities .
Heâ€ ™ s up to number six : still on the duvet .
The defence version is that the police moved the fans and the duvet .
But it would have required â€œamazing foresightâ€ � for police investigators to have moved the items and photographed them , before knowing the accusedâ€ ™ s version of events .
Such a conspiracy is â€œtoo complicated and impossibleâ€ � .
The only reasonable inference is that accused tailored a version as he continued with his evidence .
Pistorius changing his evidence mid - way through the trial explains why the defence did not earlier challenge state witnesses on where these items were in the bedroom , Nel says .
According to Pistorius , Steenkamp was still in bed when he got up to fetch in the fans from the balcony .
He said he did not see her get up because â€œit was pitch blackâ€
�
but claimed the duvet was on the bed over her legs .
All these lies caught him up â€ ¦ If he saw the duvet over Reeva , then he saw Reeva when he got up .
You tell one lie and you have to continually build on it and build on it .
His version about a perceived intruder can not be reasonably possibly true .
His version about it being pitch black can not be reasonably possibly true â€ ¦
The accused version never happened .
Judge Masipa says Gerrie Nel is moving very slowly .
Nel assures her
he will finish today .
But if he takes all day , then defence counsel takes all day tomorrow , when will Nel make his reply , Masipa asks ?
She is not available at all next week .
Nel promises â€œby hook or by crookâ€
� they will get it done by close of play on Friday .
Associated Press has filed this report on the early part of the prosecutionâ€ ™ s closing arguments : The chief prosecutor in Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ murder trial said the athleteâ€ ™ s lawyers have floated more than one theory in a dishonest attempt to defend against a murder charge for his killing of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel made the allegation during final arguments in the trial in a Pretoria courthouse , where the fathers of the Olympic runner and Steenkamp , a model and television personality , were in court for the first time since the trial began in early March .
They sat at opposite ends of a long bench in the gallery .
Nel said a criminal trial was a â€œblunt instrument for digging up the truthâ€ � but that he was confident of his case .
He said defence lawyers had argued that Pistorius acted in self - defence , fearing an intruder was in the house , but also raised the possibility that the once - celebrated athlete was not criminally responsible , accidentally shooting Steenkamp through a closed toilet door because he was â€œstartledâ€ � .
â€œItâ€
™ s two defences that you can never reconcile , â€ � Nel said .
On Thursday , some of the stateâ€ ™ s written arguments as well as transcripts of past testimony appeared on screens in the courtroom .
One section questioned Pistoriusâ€ ™ defence case : â€œIs it putative self - defence ?
Is it an act of sane automatism ?
Did he have criminal capacity to act ?
Or was it all an accident as in Tashas restaurant where he had the gun in his hand
and it purportedly discharged itself?â€
�
Earlier , Judge Thokozile Masipa told Nel and chief defence lawyer Barry Roux that they had only until the end of Friday to complete their final arguments in court .
â€œUnless , of course , you want to work on a Saturday and perhaps Sunday , after church , â€ �
she said , smiling .
A break for tea before Nel moves on to number six of his 13 incongruities in Pistoriusâ€ ™ case .
The effect of these lies creates a snowball effect , Nel says , leading to incongruity number five : Pistorius , having claimed the fans were where the duvet was found , had to tailor a version to explain why the duvet was not in fact where it was pictured .
Pistorius testified that the duvet was not on the floor .
But it was found there by police investigators .
Incongruity number four :
Pistorius in cross - examination changed his account of where the fans were to where the duvet was pictured in police photos , on the floor by the bed .
It turned his version of events into â€œa farceâ€ � .
Pistorius says he brought in the fans from the balcony and put them at the end of the bed .
But they were found by the door to the balcony , Nel says .
If Pistoriusâ€ ™ version is right , why did defence counsel not put this to the police officers Van Rensburg and Van Staden who gave evidence for the state , Nel asks .
Incongruity number three : how could Steenkamp have got out of bed and to the bathroom , in order to make a noise there , in the time it took Pistorius to get one fan ?
Nel says Pistorius had to create a version in which he fetched a second fan in order to make enough time for Steenkamp to have got to the toilet .
There wasnâ€ ™ t space in the extension cord for a second fan plug , he says ( the extension cord is missing , which has riled the defence and the judge â€ “ see earlier live blog here ) .
Itâ€ ™ s not good enough for Pistorius to claim his memory is not very good , Nel says .
He reconstructed a version , making a new claim that he might have tripped over a fan cord when running to the balcony to call for help .
But the court was told he was slow on his stumps and could not balance .
It can not be true that he ran in the dark without falling , Nel argues .
Incongruity number two is the contradiction in Pistoriusâ€ ™ evidence at the bail application and during the trial in which he first claimed , but later disputed , that he went on to the balcony to fetch the fans and heard the noise from the bathroom when there .
The accused later testified he was by the amplifier in the bedroom when he heard the noise .
Unable to explain the contradiction , Pistorius blamed his legal counsel , Nel says .
It was â€œan attempt to cover an untruthâ€ � .
Nel says that Pistorius â€œpretended to misunderstand the questionâ€ � about the fan on the balcony .
He is tailoring his version .
Nel says the state has identified â€œmanyâ€ � significant incongruities , but will list only 13 .
The first concerns Pistoriusâ€ ™ claim that he had â€œno ideaâ€ � what a zombie stopper is .
The state produced a video in which Pistorius fired a gun into a watermelon as a male voice laughed :
Itâ€ ™ s a lot softer than brains .
But [ bleep ] itâ€ ™ s like a zombie stopper .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ claims that he â€œcould not recallâ€
�
this were not true , Nel says : His evidence is simply fallacious .
Itâ€ ™ s also an indication of the nature of his evidence .
The defence claims that evidence was tampered with at Pistoriusâ€ ™ house ; Nel says there was no tampering with the scene .
There were slight differences in the placement of items in the bedroom
â€ “ nothing in the bathroom was moved .
If the court accepts the version of police witnesses , he says , Pistoriusâ€ ™ version can not be true .
Nel says it would be extraordinary if the police had moved items â€ “ the fan in front of the window ; the jeans on top of the duvet â€ “ in order to scupper a defence case that they did not yet know : His version can not be reasonably possibly true if that was the scene on the morning of 14 February .
Nel calls Pistoriusâ€ ™ evidence vague , argumentive and mendacious .
This can in no way be seen as anything but untruthful .
The accused did not present himself as someone striving to give a truthful version â€ ¦ but more concerned with the implications than the truth .
Nel rattles through some of the other problematic parts of the evidence : where did Pistorius make calls from , given the defence says he did not do so from the bedroom ?
Why do the contents of Steenkampâ€ ™ s stomach suggest she ate some hours after Pistorius said they went to bed ?
Why did Pistorius not tell those first on the scene that the shooting was a mistake ( he told them he had thought Steenkamp was an intruder ) ?
Why did defence not contest evidence from neighbour who claimed she heard a womanâ€ ™ s voice raised in argument an hour before the shooting ?
He suggests that Pistorius was not firing in panic , but aiming carefully at the person behind the door .
This is disputed in the defence heads of argument , he reveals , but points out that defence witness Thomas Wolmarans testified that there was some sight alignment .
Nel says some facts are objective : Steenkamp was fully clothed , and her phone was found in the bathroom .
There was screaming ( though who did the screaming is disputed ) .
The toilet door was locked from the inside .
Powerful ammunition was used ( state says it was black talon , defence says ranger ) .
Back to the events of 14 February .
The shots fired were not â€œwildâ€ � , Nel says : there was a good grouping of the four shots , all through the toilet door .
There is some dispute over the order of the shots , but everyone admits the first was A , Nel says ( shots A , B , C and D have been marked on the replica door , which is still in the court room ) .
The court must look at the circumstantial evidence as a whole , Nel says , not as individual parts .
It is a mosaic of proof , he says .
If the weight each piece of circumstantial evidence is that of a feather , if you pile that on a scale â€ ¦ the scale will convincingly balance in favour of the state .
It has become fashionable , Nel says , for accused people who â€œfind themselves in a quandaryâ€ � to blame the state .
He refers to another ruling from the supreme court that says it is the obligation of a prosecutor to construct a case based on credible evidence , not to present a hotch - potch of evidence and leave the court to decide what to accept .
He says South African law does not oblige him to call all witnesses on the state list
â€ “ there were questions earlier in the trial over why some witnesses who went on to testify for the defence had not appeared for the state despite being originally lined up to do so .
They included Pistoriusâ€ ™ closest neighbours Michael Nhlengethwa and Eontle Nhlengethwa , and the estate manager Johan Stander and his daughter Carice Viljoen , who were first on the scene after the shooting .
The accused has provided no credible version of events , Nel says .
The defence needs to be based on something : You need a version that is reasonably , possibly true â€ ¦ Without that , there is no defence .
Nel says he has seen the defenceâ€ ™ s heads of argument .
Nowhere does it say the accused was a good witness and the court should simply accept his evidence .
Instead it is full of reasons why he was not a good witness , claiming that his ability was â€œcompromisedâ€ � in the witness box .
The defence argument says Nel â€œrepeatedly called the accused a liarâ€ � .
The prosecutor says he has checked : he did it once and he was reprimanded by the judge .
Nel concedes he did on a number of occasions say he was lying .
( This feels like a tiny point in the grander scheme of things . )
The evidence of defence witness Professor Wayne Derman should be rejected , Nel says : he is biased as he has been Pistoriusâ€ ™ physician for some years .
( Derman was chief medical officer of the South African Paralympic team at the 2012 London Olympics , and testified to Pistoriusâ€ ™ anxiety and vulnerability . )
More inconsistencies in Pistoriusâ€ ™ version , Nel says .
At one point he said he heard â€œmovementâ€ � within the toilet cubicle .
Nel :
Thereâ€ ™ s a difference between hearing movement and hearing a noise
[ the later claim by the defence ]
â€
¦
He heard movement and he thought about the movement .
This thought process proves Pistorius was not reacting to a startle , Nel says .
Back to Pistoriusâ€ ™ own evidence .
In his bail application , Nel notes , the accused said : I fired shots at the toilet door .
That means he meant to fire , Nel says .
The defence wants the court to accept that the accused acted in response to a startle , Nel says , but an earlier version from Pistorius said he fired because he thought the intruder was coming out of the toilet .
In Pistoriusâ€ ™ evidence during the trial , Nel moves on , he claimed he â€œfired before I knewâ€
� what he was doing .
He has never said it was an accident , or that he did not mean to shoot .
Forensically , Nel points out the inconsistencies between defence witnesses .
The sound tests were conducted after witnesses had already given their testimony , he notes .
( This , of course , explains why recordings were not played to state witnesses , but fits with Nelâ€ ™ s theory that the defence is acting on the hoof . )
Nel moves on to the issue of whether the cricket bat hitting the toilet door had been confused by some witnesses with the sound of gun shots .
Why did the defence not play the recordings of the sound tests to witnesses , he wonders .
Nel says there is apparently a recording of Pistorius screaming .
Again , this was not played to witnesses .
This is because it does not advance the defence case , he argues .
Nel alleges that the defence â€œcontemplatedâ€ � manipulating the test .
Masipa intervenes : that didnâ€ ™ t happen .
But Nel says the contemplation of it is revealing .
The judge is also interested in why the tests were carried out outdoors , when the incident itself was entirely indoors .
Showing the court transcripts of earlier witness testimony , Nel points out that the claim Pistorius sounds like a woman when he screams was disputed directly by one witness , an ex - partner who said he sounds like a man .
Another state witness says she heard a man and a womanâ€ ™ s screams intermingling .
Sound tests were done by the defence , but no evidence was presented to the court from those about the sound of the scream .
Nel is picking apart the way the defence has conducted its case .
It failed to call any witnesses to substantiate claims put to state witnesses that Pistorius sounds like a woman when he screams , he points out , despite making much of this claim and saying a witness would be called to back it up .
The court needs to ask why this apparent witness was not called .
The prosecutor is dismissive of defence claims that Pistorius suffers an anxiety disorder : He has anxiety on - call .
Nel says Pistorius has refused to take any responsibility .
Heâ€ ™ s always the victim .
He always places the blames for his actions somewhere else .
Heâ€ ™ s incapable of taking responsibility for any wrongdoing .
Nel says Pistorius blamed his friend Darren Fresco for passing him a loaded handgun in the restaurant incident ; blamed his father for the illegal ammunition found in his home .
Nel now turns to the other charges Pistorius faces : two counts of discharging his firearm in a public place .
He talks the court through the timeline : these two counts were in November 2012 and January 2013 .
Then there was , he says , â€œa murder in Februaryâ€ � .
Nel turns to the night of 14 February 2013 .
He says itâ€ ™ s â€œan important factâ€ � that Steenkamp was â€œstanding , facing the accusedâ€ � behind the locked toilet door .
Pistorius fired four shots through the doorway ; three hit Steenkamp .
He used high performance Black Talon ammunition , which â€œripped through her bodyâ€ � .
In electing to give evidence , one would expect him to give an honest account â€ ¦ of what happened .
If he elects to give evidence and is not an honest witness , that is his own doing .
Nel refers to Pistoriusâ€ ™ â€œweak performanceâ€ � during cross - examination , saying he subsequently tailored his version of events .
Nel says he will argue that Pistoriusâ€ ™ version of what happened that night should be rejected by the court .
Nel will argue that â€œthere was no perceived intruder whatsoeverâ€ � .
Nel says he filed the stateâ€ ™ s argument before seeing that of the defence .
He says Pistoriusâ€ ™ team has claimed two defences : that the accused did not have criminal capacity in the heat of the moment ; but that if the court finds that he did have capacity , that he acted in self - defence .
These two arguments can not be reconciled , he says .
Itâ€ ™ s like saying you werenâ€ ™ t at the scene of a crime , but if the court finds you were , then claiming self - defence .
Masipa starts by thanking both sides for their heads of arguments
â€
“
they have already submitted written versions to her .
She says that if counsel use their time well today and tomorrow , the court will not have to sit â€œon Saturday and Sunday after churchâ€ � .
Then itâ€ ™ s over to lead counsel for the prosecution , Gerrie Nel , who begins with a yarn about his favourite ( fictional ) defence lawyer , Rumpole of the Bailey .
Day 40 of the trial is beginning .
If Masipa finds Pistorius guilty of premeditated murder â€ “ that is , he knowingly intended to kill Steenkamp , or deliberately decided to kill an intruder â€ “ he would face a mandatory life sentence .
It would be 25 years before he would even be considered for parole .
The judge will also consider whether he is guilty of murder without premeditation : an intent to kill , but with no planning , in the heat of the moment .
Sentencing for a guilty verdict here is at the judgeâ€ ™ s discretion .
There is also the possibility of a manslaughter , or culpable homicide , conviction , if the judge believes Pistoriusâ€ ™ claim that he did not mean to kill Steenkamp , but decides he acted recklessly or negligently in firing into the locked door .
Pistorius could be acquitted if the judge accepts his account that he genuinely feared for his life and thought he was acting in self - defence .
Alongside the charge of murder , Pistorius is accused of two counts of discharging firearms in public , and another of illegal possession of ammunition .
Discharging firearms in public , first count : The prosecution says he discharged a firearm at a restaurant in January 2013 .
Pistorius said his friend Darren Fresco had passed him the loaded gun and denies he pulled the trigger .
Discharging firearms in public , second count : Pistorius is accused of firing a gun through a car sunroof while he was with Fresco and Pistoriusâ€ ™ then girlfriend Samantha Taylor in November 2012 .
The athlete says he became angry after a police officer inspected his gun when the car was stopped for speeding ; the gun was apparently lying on a car seat .
But he denies firing a gun .
Both Taylor and Fresco say he did .
Illegal possession of ammunition : Pistorius is charged with being in possession of .38 ammunition ; he does not have a licence for a gun that takes that ammunition , a permit to be in possession of it or a dealerâ€ ™ s licence .
Pistorius told the court the bullets belonged to his father and he had them for safe - keeping .
If found guilty , Pistorius could face five years in prison on each of the first two counts , and 15 years for the illegal possession of ammunition .
Pistorius has arrived in court in Pretoria .
Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s family and friends are also in court , including â€ “ for the first time in this trial â€ “ her father , Barry .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ father , Henke , from whom he is estranged , is also there .
When the judge might return with a verdict is guesswork for now .
Masipa has resumed other trial duties , so her availability will be affected by that .
Media commentators who have attended court in Pretoria suggest she could take up to a month to reach her verdict , which could then take two days to read to the court .
There is no jury ; Masipa will decide on Pistoriusâ€ ™ guilt or innocence with the assistance of two assessors , Janet Henzen - Du - Toit and Themba Mazibuko .
Media Club South Africa has this helpful FAQ on the role of the assessors : For the Pistorius trial , Judge Masipa appointed Janet Henzen - du Toit and Themba Mazibuko as her assessors .
They are there to help her make a decision .
The assessors will sit with Judge Masipa during the proceedings and listen to all the evidence presented to the judge .
At the end of the case they will present their opinions to Judge Masipa .
However , she is allowed to override them .
On the Legal Brief website , Professor Annette van der Merwe , a criminal procedure law expert at the University of Pretoria , said the two assessors could overrule the judge when it comes to a verdict on the facts in a majority finding .
This means that if the two assessors were to rule in favour of murder , or the judge and one assessor were to rule so , that verdict would be the accepted one .
The same would apply if two of them were to rule in favour of an acquittal .
It is unlikely â€ “ should Pistorius be convicted of any of the charges against him â€ “ that sentencing would take place straight away .
Both state and defence would be likely to make submissions to the judge for aggravating or mitigating factors ; there could even be further witnesses .
And once sentencing has taken place , we could see an appeal from Pistorius , against any conviction and/or the sentence .
Welcome to live coverage as the high court in Pretoria prepares to hear the prosecutionâ€ ™ s final submission to the judge that Paralympic and Olympic sprinter Oscar Pistorius should be found guilty of the premeditated murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on 14 February last year .
Pistorius denies murder but admits firing four shots through a locked toilet cubicle door in his home ; he says he thought it was an intruder .
You can catch up on recent live blogs and news stories from the trial here .
I will also be tweeting updates today @Claire_Phipps .
The lengthy trial , originally slated to run for three weeks , has already taken several months , with a number of breaks , including a 30-day mental health evaluation for the accused .
The assessment concluded that he was not suffering any mental disorder at the time of the killing , but now suffers from post - traumatic stress disorder and depression .
Today is the first of two days of closing arguments .
The state , via lead counsel Gerrie Nel , will be first to put its case to Judge Thokozile Masipa , with the defence to follow â€ “ later today , if the prosecution wraps up in time , or on Friday .
Judge Masipa is then expected to give the court a date on which she will return to deliver her verdict .
Nel is unlikely to pull his punches today .
As my colleague David Smith ( @SmithInAfrica ) writes , he is not known as â€œthe pitbullâ€ � for nothing : Nel has claimed major scalps in three decades as a prosecutor , including that of Jackie Selebi , a former anti - apartheid activist who became the countryâ€ ™ s top police officer and later president of Interpol .
Nel called him an â€œarrogant liarâ€ � and secured his conviction for corruption .
During the case , Nel was arrested in front of his family in the early hours by 20 police officers â€ “ fraud charges were later dropped .
He earns about 1.3 m rand a year .
A legal source , who did not wish to be named , said : â€œIf you ask , â€˜is his cross - examination style unique to Oscar Pistorius?â€ ™ , the answer is no .
Thatâ€ ™ s how heâ€ ™ s always been .
People say he goes for the jugular , but
heâ€ ™ s got points to make and he makes them .
Heâ€ ™ s not shy.â€
�
The source said Nel had no regrets about displaying the graphic police photo of Steenkamp after her death : â€œIt was to show Pistorius the evidence .
He blew out her brains and heâ€ ™ s been vomiting into a bucket , but can he please look at what he did ?
You show the accused the evidence and the postmortem in every case
â€ “
itâ€
™ s just that this one has more attention.â€
�
Another high court - based source said Nel was a thick - skinned loner who did not care about being popular .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s a quiet guy .
There are only two things in his life : right and wrong .
Thereâ€ ™ s no maybe.â€ �"

The live blog will be back on 11 September when Judge Masipa will hand down her verdicts .
Here is a summary of the arguments by the state and the defence , along with the list of charges Pistorius faces â€ “ and possible sentences , should he be found guilty .
Thank you for reading .
The full written version of the defence heads of argument is published here : Pistorius has tweeted this message following the conclusion of closing arguments today :
Judge Thokozile Masipa has announced that she will deliver her verdict on Oscar Pistorius on 11 September .
The confirmation of the date came after a day in which the defence set out its heads of argument ( closing argument ) in the long - running trial .
Pistorius denies the murder of Reeva Steenkamp at his home in Pretoria on 14 February last year , claiming he believed she was an intruder .
The prosecution says Pistorius should be found guilty of premeditated murder .
Lead defence counsel Barry Roux compared Pistoriusâ€ ™ years of disability to an abused women who snaps and kills her husband after many assaults .
Questioned by the judge on this analogy , Roux said the shooting was a reflexive action by Pistorius after a â€œslow burnâ€ � of vulnerabilities led to a point at which he had â€œhad enoughâ€ � .
Roux says the trial should have begun with a charge of culpable homicide rather than murder .
But the defence insists Pistorius should be acquitted .
If the firing of the gun was purely reflexive , then he lacked criminal capacity ; if there was a thought process , it was â€œputative private defenceâ€ � ( self - defence ) because he believed he was in danger ; that an intruder was coming out of the toilet .
He had no motive to kill Steenkamp .
He has always said he thought it was an intruder .
The defence took the court in detail through the timeline of events on the night of 14 February 2013 in an attempt to prove the stateâ€ ™ s version â€ “ in which the fatal shots were fired at 3.17am â€ “ can not be true .
The defence says the noises heard at 3.17am were the thuds of the cricket bat as Pistorius broke down the toilet door .
The shots , it contends , were earlier , which means the screams heard before 3.17am were made by the accused , and not by Steenkamp , who was already fatally wounded .
Pistorius was seen on his prostheses in his bathroom at 3.15am by a neighbour .
It is accepted that he was on his stumps when he fired , so this sighting proves Steenkamp had already been shot .
Roux : Would it make sense â€ “ if the shots were , as submitted by the state , at 3.17am â€ “
would it make sense that before firing the shots the accused would shout : help , help , help ?
It was â€œfatal for the stateâ€ � that a security guard went past Pistoriusâ€ ™ house at 2.20am and heard no arguing .
Roux accused state witnesses of lying to the court .
A neighbour , Dr Stipp , had tailored his evidence to try to assist the stateâ€ ™ s case , Roux alleged : his timings do not add up .
Witnesses including Stipp added new details to their recollection of the screams when they testified in court .
Witnesses to two separate charges of firing a gun in a public place also â€œmaterially contradictedâ€ � each other , the defence said .
He also alleged that police had disturbed the scene in Pistoriusâ€ ™ bedroom and produced photographs that showed an officer touching items in the room .
Roux says Pistorius should be found guilty of a separate charge of negligently discharging a firearm in a restaurant .
Roux said the athlete did not deliberately pull the trigger .
He made a mistake .
Pistorius had said he was not guilty of this charge .
In a brief reply , prosecutor Gerrie Nel said Pistoriusâ€ ™ two defences â€ “ putative self - defence and that he fired involuntarily
â€ “ were not just mutually exclusive but mutually destructive : The accused intended to kill a human being .
He knew there was a human being in that toilet .
Thatâ€ ™ s his evidence â€
¦
He is guilty of murder .
There must be consequences for it .
Thatâ€ ™ s it from court for today .
The trial will resume on 11 September , when Judge Masipa will give her verdict .
Iâ€ ™ ll post a summary shortly .
Judge Masipa thanks the state and defence teams .
She will deliver her judgment on 11 September .
Nel is on his feet again .
He says Fresco ought to be able to address the court himself when judgment is handed down on the issue of indemnity .
Nel sits down .
Roux wants to say something else now .
He says the photo submitted this morning is admissible .
Masipa repeats the question she asked Nel : should Fresco receive his indemnity , promised in return for honest testimony on the two firearms offences with which Pistorius is also charged .
Roux says Fresco lied ; he should not receive indemnity .
Itâ€ ™ s not for him to say whether Fresco should be prosecuted .
Nel :
The accused intended to kill a human being .
He knew there was a human being in that toilet .
Thatâ€ ™ s his evidence â€
¦
He is guilty of murder .
There must be consequences for it .
It can not be that there should be no consequences for Pistorius if it is agreed that he intended to kill an intruder but instead killed Steenkamp , Nel tells the judge .
Nel says Pistoriusâ€ ™ two defences â€ “ putative self - defence and that he fired involuntarily â€ “ are not just mutually exclusive but mutually destructive .
Nel is back on to the issue of the multiplug extension cord .
He has never made an issue of the length of the cord , he says .
Nel now turns to the photographs the defence submitted this morning : We can not run roughshod over the principles of admissibility â€ ¦
We donâ€
™ t know when this [ photograph ] was taken .
Masipaâ€ ™ s second question : should she grant Darren Fresco indemnity as agreed â€ “ that is , should she accept that he answered all questions posed to him honestly
( the defence says he did not ) .
Nel says she should .
Her third question relates to Nelâ€ ™ s acceptance of an annexe to the defence heads of argument ; he is fine with that .
Nel is going to have the last say regardless , it seems .
He says heâ€ ™ d like to respond to the photographs the defence presented this morning .
Masipa says she has three questions for Nel first .
She wants to know if the state agrees with the defence timeline set out by Roux today .
Nel says that only the phone data is common cause ( with both sides accepting them as fact ) .
That was a very short break .
Roux says he has concluded his address
but he wants to put something on record .
As directed by the judge , written heads of argument were filed to the court and emailed to the state a few days ago .
This is so the state could address issues in the written argument when it presented its own case to the court .
The state only has the right to respond after the defence has spoken in court on points of law .
It would not be fair otherwise to let the state have the last word , Roux says .
Roux is building up to the end of his argument now but requests a brief adjournment first to check with his team .
Roux would like the court to find that Pistorius fired the shots â€œreflexivelyâ€
�
â€ “ that is , involuntarily , when anxious and startled .
But if the court rejects that , he says , it can acquit him by finding he acted reasonably , â€œand thatâ€ ™ s the end of the caseâ€ � .
That takes us to culpable homicide ( manslaughter ) , says Roux .
He says thatâ€ ™ s where this case should have started , not with a murder charge .
He says that when the court considers what a reasonable man would have done , it should consider a reasonable man with the same abilities and disabilities as Pistorius .
Is it wrong to hear a noise and decide to arm yourself because you have no legs , Roux asks ?
If the court decides that is reasonable , it must acquit him .
Roux : Hereâ€ ™ s the question : did the accused foresee the deceased was in toilet ?
Did he reconcile himself with that ?
No , his version is consistent â€ “
he thought she was in the bedroom .
This is the pure legal question : did the accused foresee the possibility that the deceased was in the toilet and did he say I donâ€ ™ t care , Iâ€ ™ m going to shoot anyway ?
No .
He genuinely thought she was in the bedroom .
Intention needs to be proved , says Roux , for murder by dolus directus or dolus eventualis : premeditated murder in the first case , and in the second , an awareness that actions could result in death â€œand he is reconciled with thatâ€ � .
Neither is true here , says Roux : you can not convict him of murder .
On to the issue of dolus eventualis
â€ “ that he armed himself and fired in the knowledge that his actions might result in someoneâ€ ™ s death .
Why would Steenkamp have to tell Pistorius she was going to the bathroom , Roux asks .
He says it is not strange that she had her phone with her ; there is evidence that she had previously sent WhatsApp messages from the toilet .
She didnâ€ ™ t switch on lights because she had the light from her phone , he suggests .
When Pistorius yelled that there was an intruder , it is not strange to think Steenkamp might have stayed hidden and quiet , locking the toilet door to keep safe .
I would have done the same , Roux says .
If the accused was threatening to shoot her , why would she stand right behind the door , he asks .
The bathroom window was open , Roux says : it was not a figment of Pistoriusâ€ ™ imagination .
The accused had asked Steenkamp to close the balcony doors and she hadnâ€ ™ t ; it was a hot night .
If she got up to go to the toilet â€ “ Roux reminds the court she had emptied her bladder â€ “ as Pistorius was closing the balcony doors , would it be strange for her to open the window in the bathroom ?
Roux moves on to the issue of dolus directus â€ “ premeditated murder â€ “ of which the state says Pistorius should be found guilty .
The defence timeline of events is not consistent with dolus directus , Roux says .
If he intended to kill Steenkamp , why did he fire from the entrance of the bathroom instead of walking in ?
Why did he fire on his stumps , aiming low ?
Pistorius has a long history of feeling insecure and vulnerable especially when without his prostheses , Roux says .
Professor Derman tested him well before the shooting and found high levels of anxiety .
The state does not challenge the evidence that Pistorius suffers from anxiety , he says : â€œThey could not say itâ€ ™ s not
so.â€
�
This state of mind compromised his ability in the witness box , Roux argues .
The judge should take this into account .
Roux says Pistorius â€œhad
no clueâ€ � when he gave his version of events at the bail application of the statements from witnesses .
He has not come up with a new version of what happened .
He has always said he thought it was an intruder .
Pistorius was â€œdesperateâ€ � to save Steenkamp and called for help , Roux says .
That is not consistent with the actions of a man who wanted to kill his girlfriend .
Nel is wrong to be conflating different times to suggest Pistorius has tailored his evidence , Roux asserts .
When Pistorius woke up he saw the fans on the balcony and that the door was still open .
The blue light of the amplifier was not his focus but it bothered him when he came back into the room .
Nel had disputed why he would cover the light .
Other alleged incongruities Roux is dismissive of : Details of Pistoriusâ€ ™ account that emerged after the bail application reveal no tailoring of evidence , Roux says : The state alleged that â€œallâ€ � the couples who were witnesses said they had woken each other to ask about the sounds they heard .
That is not true , says Roux : only one witness said they had done this .
It was not strange that Pistorius did not make sure Steenkamp was in bed when he heard what he thought was an intruder .
Roux sneers at the stateâ€ ™ s point number 12 : that Pistorius first said he whispered to Steenkamp , and later said he used a â€œsoft voiceâ€ � .
It simply doesnâ€ ™ t matter , Roux tells the judge .
Roux dismisses
Nelâ€ ™ s third alleged incongruity , and criticism of Pistoriusâ€ ™ poor memory .
â€œHe has a severe depression , â€ � Roux says .
â€œYou can not criticise him for that.â€ �
Incongruity numbers four and five concern the duvet â€ “ Iâ€ ™ ve dealt with that , says Roux .
He says there was no blood splatter on the bed ; doesnâ€ ™ t this suggest the duvet was in fact on the bed ?
Six and seven also deal with the duvet and other items in the bedroom .
The second alleged incongruity was the apparently contradictory evidence given by Pistorius about whether he heard the first noise ( that he thought was an intruder ) on the balcony or in the bedroom .
He did not ever say he heard the noise on the balcony , Roux says .
Nel is wrong in his interpretation .
Turning now to Nelâ€ ™ s â€œbakerâ€ ™ s dozenâ€ � of 13 alleged incongruities in the defence case , as outlined by the prosecutor yesterday .
On the first â€ “ the video in which Pistorius fired into a watermelon and called it a zombie - stopper â€ “ Roux says it is understandable that Pistorius did not remember saying it
: he was focused on his murder trial and the quote was out of context .
Roux admits that the duvet on the floor does not work in Pistoriusâ€ ™ favour .
But he says his client did not lie when he said it was on the bed .
He was â€œfixatedâ€ � on looking for Steenkamp after the gunshots , Roux says ; he was traumatised and not looking for the duvet .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not too important.â€
�
Back to the police officers at the scene .
Pistorius did not have a motive to kill Steenkamp , Roux says .
Their messages to each other on the day before the shooting were â€œlovelyâ€ � .
Roux points out that Yvette Van Schalkwyk , a social worker and probation officer who was asked â€“independently of the defence â€ “ to assist Pistorius in his first court appearance in February 2013 .
Van Schalkwyk came forward as a witness because she was â€œupsetâ€
� by what she read about Pistorius allegedly â€œputting on a showâ€ � when he was crying in court : What I saw from the first time I saw him was a man who was heartbroken â€ ¦
He cried , he was in mourning , he suffered emotionally .
He was very sorry for the loss , especially for the parents , what they were going through .
Roux says the testimony of the social worker was that his emotions were â€œnever about him , what was going to happen to him or whether heâ€ ™ d get bailâ€ � .
After 7 February , Roux says , all WhatsApp messages between the couple were loving .
There is also the evidence of the Valentineâ€ ™ s card Steenkamp had written to Pistorius ( â€œToday is a good day to tell you that I love youâ€ � ) , he adds .
Roux quotes from the psychological report on Pistorius , which concluded he was not a narcissist , psychopath or malingerer .
He and Steenkamp had a normal , loving relationship , with no evidence of violence or aggression .
His method of conflict resolution in the relationship was to walk away , the psychologist noted .
( You can read the key conclusions of the psychologistâ€ ™ s reports here . )
Roux says the evidence does not justify the inference that the accused and the deceased were arguing .
The security guard who went past the house at 2.20am heard nothing .
Roux says he has a few more points to make on the issue of the screaming .
He wants the court to note the similarities in the statements made by witnesses for the state ( and husband and wife )
Charl Johnson and Michelle Burger .
Their statements are virtually identical , Roux says : it is quite clear Johnson â€œadaptedâ€ � his evidence to match that of Burger .
In court , they both used the word â€œfadeâ€ � in relation to the screaming , when they had not used it in their earlier statements , Roux says .
He says he will not draw conclusions about why this is .
But there is no guarantee of independence in their testimony .
Roux is on his feet again .
He says he is aware of time constraints â€ “ he must conclude his arguments today .
A brief round - up , as the court is taking a short lunchbreak in an effort to ensure it hears the whole of the defence closing argument today : all sides are agreed that they should try to do this as Judge Masipa is not available next week .
Lead defence counsel Barry Roux has compared Pistoriusâ€ ™ years of disability to an abused women who snaps and kills her husband after many assaults .
Questioned by the judge on this analogy , Roux said the shooting was a reflexive action by Pistorius after a â€œslow burnâ€ � of vulnerabilities led to a point at which he had â€œhad enoughâ€ � .
The defence has taken the court in detail through the timeline of events on the night of 14 February 2013 in an attempt to prove the stateâ€ ™ s version â€ “ in which the fatal shots were fired at 3.17am â€ “ can not be true .
The defence says the noises heard at 3.17am were the thuds of the cricket bat as Pistorius broke down the toilet door .
The shots were earlier , which means the screams heard before 3.17am were made by the accused , and not by Steenkamp , who was already fatally wounded .
Roux accused a state witness , Dr Stipp , of tailoring his evidence to try to assist the stateâ€ ™ s case .
His timings do not add up , Roux claimed .
He also alleged that police had disturbed the scene in Pistoriusâ€ ™ bedroom and produced photographs that showed an officer touching items in the room .
Roux says Pistorius should be found guilty of negligently discharging a firearm in a restaurant .
Roux says he did not deliberately pull the trigger .
He made a mistake .
Reuters has filed a report on the morningâ€ ™ s hearing : Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ â€œprimal instinctsâ€ � kicked in when he shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp because he was in a vulnerable and fearful state , his defence lawyer said at the athleteâ€ ™ s murder trial on Friday .
Barry Roux said during his closing arguments that psychological evidence had proven the track star had a heightened fight response because of his disability .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re standing at that door .
Youâ€ ™ re vulnerable .
Youâ€ ™ re anxious .
Youâ€ ™ re trained as an athlete to react .
Take all those factors into account , â€ � Roux said , adding that Pistorius had felt exposed because he was standing on the stumps of his legs .
â€œHe stands with his finger on the trigger , ready to fire when ready .
In some instances a person will fire reflexively , â€ � he added .
â€œThat is your primal instinct.â€ �
Roux also argued that prosecutors had only called witnesses who supported their argument and not other key people , including police officers , who he said would have undermined their case .
He said the trial should only ever have been on the charge of culpable homicide , rather than murder , because he said Pistorius had clearly shot Steenkamp by mistake .
Nel and Roux have focused much of their closing arguments on evidence from witnesses who say they heard a woman scream before a volley of shots , supporting the prosecutionâ€ ™ s position that the couple had an argument before Steenkamp was killed .
Roux went through the early morning of the shooting minute - by - minute during his wrapping - up , arguing that the witnesses were confused and contradictory about the sounds they heard .
He also spent time analysing photos he said proved the police had moved items in the coupleâ€ ™ s bedroom , countering a key claim by Nel that images of the room proved Pistoriusâ€ ™ version of the events were impossible .
Roux says his throat is giving out .
Court breaks for lunch â€ “ back in just over half an hour .
I will aim to post a brief summary before they come back .
Roux says Steenkampâ€ ™ s body was not refrigerated for 10 hours after she died .
Digestion continues after death .
Even if she ate at 1 am , he says , the fact Prof Saayman could distinguish the food sheâ€ ™
d eaten â€ “ vegetable matter
â€ “ in her stomach shows the process of gastric emptying .
By the stateâ€ ™ s rules , there should have been no recognisable particles .
Can you take it as a fact that she ate at 1 oâ€ ™ clock in the morning ?
No , you can not .
Would an athlete and model really wait until 1 am â€ “ or wake up in the middle of the night â€ “ to go and eat together in the kitchen , as the state suggests ?
It does not make sense , says Roux .
There is a period of inactivity on Pistoriusâ€ ™ iPad between 7 pm and 8 pm when he says they were having dinner .
I donâ€ ™ t know , says Roux , if Steenkamp got up for something to eat while Pistorius was sleeping .
She knew how to work the alarm system and could have gone downstairs .
Itâ€ ™ s a possibility , he says .
Now to the contested issue of when Reeva Steenkamp last ate .
Nel yesterday cited the testimony of Professor Gert Saayman , whose analysis of Steenkampâ€ ™ s stomach contents indicated she had eaten about two hours before her death .
That would suggest she was awake at around 1 am .
Pistorius claims the couple went to bed around 10 pm .
Roux says the assessment of gastric emptying is not an exact science .
Even Saayman said it could have been 11 pm when she ate .
There is no mention of stomach contents in the post mortem , Roux adds .
Roux is now talking about acoustics expert Ivan Lin , another defence witness .
His testimony was not to settle the matter of the difference between male and female screaming , Roux says , but to show that screaming from the toilet cubicle could not have been heard at the home of witness Mrs Burger .
He says Burgerâ€ ™ s testimony about â€œbloodcurling screamsâ€ � tallies with that of the next - door neighbour hearing a man .
Yesterday , Nel asked why the defence did not call a witness to back its claim that Pistorius screams like a woman .
Roux says the witnesses who were not called by the state but were on the state list were not available to the defence before the state case closed .
Once they could call them , their evidence on the screaming was better than that of experts : â€œThey were there.â€ �
Roux says the state has â€œno explanationâ€ � for these key points .
Thereâ€ ™ s no mosaic and no dropping of the baton .
Everything fits in .
Has the state proved that the only reasonable inference is that the shots were fired at 3.17 ?
It can not be .
Roux : Would it make sense â€ “ if the shots were , as submitted by the state , at 3.17am â€ “
would it make sense that before firing the shots the accused would shout : help , help , help ?
Would he shout help , help , help , if he was in this rage mood ?
If he was standing in the bathroom talking to the deceased in the toilet ?
Roux says you would expect Pistorius to call for help and scream after he realised what he had done .
State has failed to explain the first noises , or when Pistorius would have been able to break down the door with the cricket bat , in its version , Roux says .
He runs the court through all the things Pistorius would have had to do between shooting Steenkamp at 3.17am and neighbours arriving at 3.22am , if the state version is to be believed .
On the stateâ€ ™ s version , there was only one and a half minutes between shooting at 3.17am and ringing estate manager Johan Stander .
He also had to go to the balcony to call for help , put on his prostheses , fetch the cricket bat and break the door down , unlock the door and pick up Steenkamp , fetch his phone and make the calls .
It is impossible , Roux says .
It can not be .
Colonel Gerhard Vermeulen is the a forensic investigator who gave evidence about the cricket bat used by Pistorius to break down the toilet door .
Roux turns to the evidence of neighbour Estelle van der Merwe , who told the court she heard arguing in the early hours .
Roux is more concerned with what she heard later : shots , then a woman crying loudly .
Her husband corrected her , said Roux : it was the accused crying .
This is consistent with the accusedâ€ ™ s version , he says : a short timelapse between the first shots and the screaming .
Some witnesses interpreted the screaming as a woman screaming , but the closest neighbours Michael Nhlengethwa and Eontle Nhlengethwa , who testified for the defence , said it was a man .
Back to the first sounds , which the defence says were the gunshots .
He says Mrs Stipp says she heard both a woman and a man screaming after 3.17am .
( By either state or defence version of events , that is probably not right .
It is agreed that Steenkamp had been shot by then . )
He says the evidence from neighbour Mr Johnson was that the screaming sounded as if â€œthey were being attackedâ€ � .
Dr Stipp also testified to hearing screams , Roux says .
There was a break for lunch in the middle of Stippâ€ ™ s testimony , Roux says : after the hour - long break , Stipp described the screams ( as he had not done in his police statement ) as anguished , fearful , severely emotional .
Prior to lunch and in his earlier statements , he had merely said it was a female voice .
Why did he not say this before , Roux asks .
You can not rely on him .
You have to put a big question mark on his evidence .
Roux says this manipulation of the timeline was not accidental .
To have Pistorius walking on his prostheses in the bathroom before 3.17am was â€œbad for the stateâ€ � , he says : it proves the noises at 3.17am were the bat against the door , not the gunshots .
Roux says the defence handed in photos to show the lights in the bathroom and adjoining toilet cubicle : the light was shining from the bathroom into the toilet .
This means , Roux says , that when Stipp saw the lights , the toilet door was already opened .
That is , after Pistorius had broken down the door .
Dr Stipp could not have made his call to security at 3.27am , or seen the man in the bathroom at 3.30am , because he was already at the accusedâ€ ™
s house by then .
His wife , who also gave evidence , told the security guard Baba at 3.22am that her husband had seen the man walking in Pistoriusâ€ ™ bathroom .
Roux has a problem with some detail of Dr Stippâ€ ™ s testimony .
It is untruthful , he says ; he â€œdesperately wanted to assist the stateâ€ � .
Stipp says his first call to security at 3.15am did not go through , and a second call at 3.27am did , resulting in the security guard Peter Baba coming to his house .
He said it was after 3.27am that he heard a manâ€ ™ s voice shouting â€œhelpâ€ � , with security arriving around 3.30am .
They then went to the accusedâ€ ™ s house , where Stipp examined Steenkamp .
Measured against objective facts , this timeline does not work , Roux says .
He has already argued that telephone data shows the first call did go through and Baba went to his house then .
Roux will begin by trying to prove to the court that the first set of sounds heard on 14 February 2013 were the gunshots .
First he says he needs to deal with an element of Dr Stippâ€ ™ s evidence .
Stipp says he saw a man â€ “ who must be Pistorius â€ “ walking into the bathroom at 3.15am .
This shows , says Roux , that the second set of sounds at 3.17am must have been the cricket bat , because it is accepted he was on his prostheses then , and not for the earlier gunshots .
The Oscar Pistorius Trial channel â€ “ which , admittedly , is watched by people with a particular interest in the unfolding case , as well as live bloggers â€ “ has been conducting a poll of viewers : 71 % say they plan to take a dayâ€ ™ s leave from work to hear the final verdict being delivered .
We should hear a date from the judge today when she will return to give her verdict .
Masipa has resumed other trial duties , so her availability will be affected by that .
Media commentators who have attended court in Pretoria suggest she could take up to a month to reach her verdict , which could then take two days to read to the court .
Where yesterday Gerrie Nel tore into the character of Pistorius , disputing his evidence and saying his version of events was â€œdevoid of truthâ€
�
, it is clear the defence argument is going to focus closely on the timeline of events on 14 February 2013 .
There are difficulties with both versions of events : Judge Masipa allows a 15-minute break .
Roux says witnesses testify that , on arrival at the house at 3.22am , Pistorius was carrying Steenkamp down the stairs .
All witness accounts tally with this apart from Dr Stippâ€ ™ s .
Roux says call data show the call from Stipp to security did go through .
Accepting this , all the accounts and timings tally with the defence timeline .
Roux zooms in on the evidence of Dr Stipp , a neighbour of Pistorius and witness for the state .
Stipp said he saw a man in the bathroom window at 3.15am , but this could only be true if the accused was wearing his prosthetic legs , Roux says .
It is accepted that he was on his stumps when he fired the shots , then put them on to break down the door .
This backs the defence claim that the second sounds at 3.17am was the cricket bat , Roux argues , and that Stipp saw Pistorius after the shooting .
Roux says security went past Pistoriusâ€ ™ house at 2.20am and heard no arguing .
Everything was normal .
This is â€œfatal for the stateâ€ � , which says the couple did not go to bed and were awake and arguing .
Security passed again four minutes later and saw nothing out of the ordinary .
Roux takes the court through the timeline of events on the night of 14 February , minute by minute .
Much of it is based on telephone data .
We donâ€
™ t know the exact time of the first set of noises , Roux says , but it was some time before 3.15am .
A witness , Stipp , said he was on the phone trying to get through to 911 when he heard second sounds at 3.17am .
Roux says there was roughly a five - minute gap between the gunshots and the second group of â€œbangsâ€ � â€ “ which the defence says is the cricket bat on the door .
Roux cites a number of witnesses who heard shouting : â€œHelp , help , help.â€ �
It all fits with the defence timeline , he says .
This would have been around 3.14am , Roux argues .
This was after Pistorius had fired the shots and was calling for help .
We know the screaming was between the first and second set of bangs , Roux says .
He says this was Pistorius .
Roux turns his attentions back to the shooting of Reeva Steenkamp .
There were two sets of noises heard by neighbours , he says .
The defence contends the first set were the gunshots , the second the sound of Pistorius breaking down the toilet door with a cricket bat .
The state says the second set of sounds were the gunshots .
It does not say what the first set was .
After the shots , it has been established that Steenkamp would not have been able to scream .
The defence says this means that the screams heard between the first and second set of noises must have been Pistorius .
On the final charge , of illegal possession of ammunition , the defence says Pistorius was merely looking after his fatherâ€ ™ s ammunition in his safe .
The athlete did not have a gun that could use these bullets .
He didnâ€ ™ t have a licence for them because they were not his .
On the charge that Pistorius fired a gun in a restaurant , Roux says he did not deliberately pull the trigger .
He made a mistake .
Roux says Pistorius should be found guilty of negligently discharging the firearm .
On the other charges against Pistorius , including the two incidents in which he apparently fired a gun in public , Roux says witnesses against him are not credible : Roux says the court should disregard the testimony of Samantha Taylor , an ex - girlfriend who said Pistorius fired a gun through a car sunroof , because she has admitted the athlete cheated on her with Steenkamp .
â€œShe has a motive.â€ � Taylor and Fresco â€œmaterially
contradictedâ€ � each other , Roux says .
Roux turns to the evidence that he says Nel is ignoring in the stateâ€ ™ s heads of argument : the first noises ( which the defence says was the shots ; the state offers no explanation ) ; the cricket bat ; the evidence of the neighbours who said they heard Pistorius screaming in a high - pitched wail .
You can not take several different possibilities and put them together to make a fact , Roux says .
He criticises Nel for quoting in the heads of argument a psychologist in a radio interview discussing the WhatsApp messages : â€œThat was naughty.â€ �
Was Pistorius argumentative in the witness box ?
Yes , says Roux .
He should not have been .
But he was 26 , 27 ; he was apprehensive .
He was being questioned by someone who was calling him a murderer .
Roux moves to Pistoriusâ€ ™ bail application .
He had just been through a traumatic event , says the lawyer , and is then told by the state he has committed premeditated murder .
He makes much of the stateâ€ ™ s original contention that Pistorius had put on his prostheses to go to the bathroom to shoot ( both sides now concede he was on his stumps when he fired ) .
Investigating officer Botha claimed at the bail hearing that Pistorius fired while standing right in front of the toilet door ( this has also been disproved ) .
Roux says it was the ( wrong ) evidence presented at the bail hearing that prompted the charge of premeditated murder .
Masipa queries the analogy Roux made between Pistoriusâ€ ™ situation and that of an abused woman .
As a judge , Masipa is renowned for her tough stance on abusers .
Roux says the athleteâ€ ™ s disabilities contributed , over many years , to a feeling that he could not run away .
This gave him an exaggerated fight response .
This was the â€œslow burnâ€ � for him , not abuse .
When the abused woman kills her abuser , it is because she has had enough , not because of the most recent assault .
The cup is full to the brim , Roux says .
The judge will need to decide why Pistorius fired the shots , Roux says .
Was it reflexive action only , or action with thought ?
If purely reflexive , then he lacked criminal capacity , Roux insists .
If the judge finds there was thought behind the shooting , though , Roux says this is not murder but â€œputative private defenceâ€ � ( self - defence ) .
But what was the thought process ?
It was that he believed he was in danger ; that an intruder was coming out of the toilet .
Roux concedes that by arming himself , Pistorius anticipated he might have to shoot .
But this fear is consistent with the responses of a disabled man with a â€œslow burnâ€ � of insecurities .
The judge canâ€ ™ t look at the shooting in isolation , Roux says .
Just as a woman kills her abusive husband after many years , so Pistorius built up an exaggerated response to danger .
He says it is not contradictory to pose two defences : of putative self - defence , and involuntary response to a startle .
Pistorius was vulnerable , anxious .
He stands now with his finger ready to fire if necessary .
He stands there , then [ roux thumps desk ] BANG .
In some instances a person will fire , reflexive .
In some instances not .
Roux says the state queries why Pistorius did not call the police .
By that time heâ€ ™ d called Johan Stander , the estate security manager , and 911 for an ambulance , Roux said : Now to the WhatsApp messages .
Both sides agree 90 % of messages between the couple were loving , but Nel said yesterday : But itâ€ ™ s the 10 % that matters .
Itâ€ ™ s like saying you have cancer in your lungs but itâ€ ™ s only a small part of your body .
Itâ€ ™ s that 10 % that counts .
They made up after the message in which Steenkamp said she was scared , Roux says .
It was resolved .
Nel is the one who is tailoring his story , Roux argues .
The prosecutor said he did not believe that Pistorius deactivated the alarm , as he claimed , because the alarm was never on : the couple were still awake .
But elsewhere in the state heads of argument , Roux notes , Nel says Steenkamp could not have gone downstairs to eat at 1 am because she would have had to switch off the alarm .
Nel can not have it both ways , Roux tells the judge .
The defence also has an issue with Nelâ€ ™ s analysis of the shots through the door
â€
“
he said there was aim and a â€œgood groupingâ€ � of bullets , rather than wild firing .
If you put me two metres from the door and I shot , Iâ€ ™ m pretty sure I could get a better grouping .
He also disputes Nelâ€ ™ s contention that Steenkamp was standing behind the toilet door , talking to Pistorius .
But the athlete was not in the bathroom , Roux says ( the toilet was in a cubicle beyond the bathroom itself ) , but at the entrance , in the doorway .
This was backed up by Captain Mangena , a witness for the state , Roux points out .
Roux launches a defence of one of his witnesses , Professor Wayne Derman , of whom Nel was scathing yesterday .
Derman , chief medical officer of the South African Paralympic team at the 2012 London Olympics and a physician to Pistorius , is one of the most qualified people in his field , Roux says .
everything he told the court was backed up by research , even if he did not keep notes .
Everything he told the court was backed up by research , even if he did not keep notes .
The only detail he could not remember was the second startle ( one of three noises said to have provoked Pistoriusâ€ ™ actions on the night ) .
In law , Roux says , moving on , whether or not someone acted in a reasonable way is subjective .
If it was genuinely the accusedâ€ ™ s perception that there was an intruder , you have to test the intention .
If you decide his actions were negligent , that is culpable homicide .
Roux says culpable homicide is what the trial should have been about â€ “
â€œbut
unfortunately it was notâ€ � .
Roux says the court can not ignore the evidence that the crime scene was tampered with by police .
He says the stateâ€ ™ s case is compromised by its failure to show the court the photos seen this morning .
Roux is now tearing into differing accounts given by police officers who attended the scene : Botha was the initial investigation officer , but was sacked after being charged with seven counts of attempted murder himself .
Nel ridiculed the idea of a police conspiracy in his argument yesterday .
Roux says the defence does not allege a conspiracy , but says there was no respect for the crime scene .
Things were moved â€œinadvertentlyâ€ � in the bedroom , he says .
But it was not fair to cross - examine Pistorius about the placement of items , and call his version a lie , when the police had disturbed the scene , Roux insists .
Nel also accused Pistorius of lying about where he placed the fans when he brought them in from the balcony .
The athlete says he put them at the end of the bed ; Nel said the cord would not have been able to reach .
Here , Roux says , is the photo that proves it does reach : Roux now shows the court a photograph obtained by the defence showing Colonel van Rensburg , one of the police investigators , touching a plug at the crime scene .
Police had denied touching or moving anything in the room .
The plug has been the source of contention , with the state disputing Pistoriusâ€ ™ testimony concerning two fans in his room , saying there was not space on the multiplug for a second fan .
Nel told Pistorius he was lying , Roux points out .
( The extension cord itself is missing , which has riled the defence and the judge â€ “ see earlier live blog here . )
Roux begins with reference to photographs he mentioned yesterday .
Gerrie Nel , in the stateâ€ ™ s heads of argument , showed the court a photograph of the view from the bedroom of Anette Stipp showing a clear sightline to the bathroom in Pistoriusâ€ ™ house .
Why did Nel not show a photo with the curtain in its normal place , Roux asks .
This is not a true reflection of what the witness could see .
Judge Masipa has arrived .
Barry Roux is straight up .
The defence team has released its written heads of argument , highlights of which will be presented to the judge in court today ( she already has the written version ) .
Iâ€ ™ ll aim to get a full version on the blog as soon as possible , but in the meantime , you can see it via this link .
Reporters in the court in Pretoria are racing through the written argument
â€ “
it is 243 pages long â€ “ before the court session starts in the next 10 minutes .
Pistorius and his family are in court now , as are June and Barry Steenkamp , the parents of Reeva Steenkamp , and their supporters .
If Masipa finds Pistorius guilty of premeditated murder â€ “ that is , he knowingly intended to kill Steenkamp , or deliberately decided to kill an intruder â€ “ he would face a mandatory life sentence .
It would be 25 years before he would even be considered for parole .
The judge will also consider whether he is guilty of murder without premeditation : an intent to kill , but with no planning , in the heat of the moment .
Sentencing for a guilty verdict here is at the judgeâ€ ™ s discretion .
There is also the possibility of a manslaughter , or culpable homicide , conviction , if the judge believes Pistoriusâ€ ™ claim that he did not mean to kill Steenkamp , but decides he acted recklessly or negligently in firing into the locked door .
Pistorius could be acquitted if the judge accepts his account that he genuinely feared for his life and thought he was acting in self - defence .
Alongside the charge of murder , Pistorius is accused of two counts of discharging firearms in public , and another of illegal possession of ammunition .
Discharging firearms in public , first count : The prosecution says he discharged a firearm at a restaurant in January 2013 .
Pistorius said his friend Darren Fresco had passed him the loaded gun and denies he pulled the trigger .
Discharging firearms in public , second count : Pistorius is accused of firing a gun through a car sunroof while he was with Fresco and Pistoriusâ€ ™ then girlfriend Samantha Taylor in November 2012 .
The athlete says he became angry after a police officer inspected his gun when the car was stopped for speeding ; the gun was apparently lying on a car seat .
But he denies firing a gun .
Both Taylor and Fresco say he did .
Illegal possession of ammunition : Pistorius is charged with being in possession of .38 ammunition ; he does not have a licence for a gun that takes that ammunition , a permit to be in possession of it or a dealerâ€ ™ s licence .
Pistorius told the court the bullets belonged to his father and he had them for safe - keeping .
If found guilty , Pistorius could face five years in prison on each of the first two counts , and 15 years for the illegal possession of ammunition .
He denies all the charges .
Today sees the second day of closing arguments ( heads of argument in South African law ) on day 41 of the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp at his home in Pretoria on 14 February last year .
It is the turn of the defence via lead counsel Barry Roux to present the summary of its case , before the judge gives an indication of when she will return with her verdict .
There is no jury , though Judge Thokozile Masipa will be guided in her deliberations by two court assessors .
You can read more about their role here .
Pistorius denies murder , claiming he believed an intruder was behind the locked toilet door , discovering it was his girlfriend only after firing the four fatal shots .
On Thursday the prosecution tore into that argument , insisting that Pistoriusâ€ ™ version of events was â€œdevoid of truthâ€ � .
Lead counsel for the state , Gerrie Nel , told the judge that she should find the accused guilty of premeditated murder : He had lots of time for reflection .
He made up his mind in the bedroom when he armed himself .
That is pre - planning .
Regardless of who was behind the door , Pistorius is guilty of murder , Nel argued .
Whether he believed the person behind the door was an intruder or knew it was Steenkamp , it was murder by dolus directus ( premeditated murder ) or dolus eventualis ( that he must have known he was likely to kill the person by firing ) .
He meant to fire and he aimed at the person in the cubicle .
The prosec repeatedly accused Pistorius of tailoring his evidence , saying that contested claims about the location of a duvet and two fans in the athleteâ€ ™ s bedroom and inconsistencies in his version of events on the night were the consequence of a â€œsnowball effect of liesâ€ � .
The court should have no difficulty in rejecting his full version of events , not only as not reasonably possibly true , but in essence as being absolutely devoid of any truth .
Itâ€ ™ s a snowball effect of lies .
You tell one and it becomes too much .
You just have to keep going and going .
Nel , who has seen the defenceâ€ ™ s written heads of argument , said Pistoriusâ€ ™ legal team was set to argue that the athlete acted in self - defence , faced with a perceived intruder , but also that he fired involuntarily because he was startled .
â€œItâ€
™ s two defences that you can never reconcile , â€ � Nel told the court .
You can read a summary of the stateâ€ ™ s heads of argument here and the full closing argument here .
Thursdayâ€ ™ s live blog is here and the report of the dayâ€ ™ s hearing is here .
This live blog will have updates from the high court in Pretoria as they happen today ; I will also be tweeting key developments @Claire_Phipps ."
2014-08-08,"The trial of Oscar Pistorius for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp has concluded and Judge Thokozile Masipa – there is no jury – will return to hand down her verdict on 11 September .
Here is a summary of the closing arguments by the state , which argues that Pistorius should be found guilty of premeditated murder , and the defence , which says he should be acquitted .
The athlete denies murder , saying he mistakenly shot his girlfriend in the early hours of 14 February 2013 believing there was an intruder in the house .
The state ’s case
The prosecution says Pistorius is guilty of murder .
Lead counsel for the state Gerrie Nel told the court that the accused ’s actions in fetching the gun and walking down the corridor towards the bathroom indicates premeditation : “
He had lots of time for reflection .
He made up his mind in the bedroom when he armed himself .
That is
pre - planning . ” Nel said Pistorius was an “ appalling witness ” whose testimony was “ devoid of truth …
The accused is more interested in fending for his life than in entrusting the court with a truthful account .
”
The prosecutor highlighted what he called significant incongruities in the defence case , arguing that conflicting evidence about the position of fans and a duvet in the accused ’s bedroom proved Pistorius was tailoring his evidence to mask the fact that he knew it was Steenkamp in the toilet cubicle when he fired four shots through the door .
There is no proof the police tampered with the crime scene , Nel said .
The position of items in the bedroom means Pistorius’ version can not be true .
Whether he believed the person behind the door was an intruder or knew it was Steenkamp , it was murder by dolus directus ( premeditated murder ) or dolus eventualis
( he must have known he was likely to kill the person by firing ) .
Nel told the judge : “ The accused intended to kill a human being .
He knew there was a human being in that toilet .
That ’s his evidence …
He is guilty of murder .
There must be consequences for it .
”
But Nel insisted Pistorius knew it was Steenkamp .
She was facing the door when he fired directly at her .
He said WhatsApp messages between the pair show they were having problems , with Steenkamp saying she was “ scared
” of her boyfriend .
Nel told the court :
“
This was not a normal relationship .
This relationship ended in death .
”
The prosecution contends that the pair were arguing .
A witness says she heard a row , another saw the bathroom light on and Steenkamp ’s stomach contents indicate she was awake and eating several hours after Pistorius said they had gone to sleep .
“
Nobody went to bed in that house , ” Nel said .
“ Nobody was sleeping .
”
State witnesses who said they heard a woman showed “ extraordinary corroboration ” in their independent statements to police .
Witnesses also heard “ intermingling ” screams of a man and a woman , disputing claims by the defence that the only screams on the night were that of Pistorius .
The other charges ( see below ) faced , and denied , by Pistorius show a pattern of behaviour in which the athlete acts recklessly and does not take responsibility for his actions , the state argues .
The written heads of argument can be read in full here .
The case for the defence The defence says the trial should have begun with a charge of culpable homicide rather than murder , but insists Pistorius should be acquitted .
If the firing of the gun was purely reflexive , he lacked criminal capacity ; if there was a thought process , it was “ putative private defence ” ( self - defence ) because he believed he was in danger – that an intruder was coming out of the toilet .
He had no motive to kill Steenkamp .
He has always said he thought it was an intruder .
Lead defence counsel Barry Roux compared Pistorius’ years of disability to an abused women who kills her husband after many assaults .
The shooting was a reflexive action after a “ slow burn ” of vulnerabilities led to a point at which he had “ had enough ” .
He was anxious and acting on “ primal instinct ” .
The defence says the state ’s version of events – in which the fatal shots were fired at 3.17am – can not be true .
The defence says noises heard at 3.17am were the thuds of the cricket bat as Pistorius broke down the toilet door .
The shots , it contends , were earlier , which means the screams heard before 3.17am were made by the accused , and not by Steenkamp , who was already fatally wounded .
Roux asked the judge : “ If the shots were , as submitted by the state , at 3.17am – would it make sense that before firing the shots the accused would shout : help , help , help ?
”
It was “ fatal for the state ” that a security guard went past Pistorius’ house at 2.20am and heard no arguing .
State witnesses gave false evidence to the court , Roux alleged .
A neighbour , Dr Johan Stipp , had tailored his evidence to try to assist the state ’s case , it was claimed : his timings do not add up .
Witnesses including Stipp added new details to their recollection of the screams when they testified in court .
Witnesses to two separate charges of firing a gun in a public place also “ materially contradicted ” each other , the defence said .
He also alleged that police had disturbed the scene in Pistorius’ bedroom and produced photographs that showed an officer touching items in the room .
Roux says Pistorius should be found guilty of a separate charge of negligently discharging a firearm in a restaurant .
Roux said the athlete did not deliberately pull the trigger .
He made a mistake .
Pistorius had pleaded not guilty to this charge .
The written heads of argument can be read in full here .
The charges Pistorius faces If Masipa finds Pistorius guilty of premeditated murder – that is , he knowingly intended to kill Steenkamp , or deliberately decided to kill an intruder – he would face a mandatory life sentence .
It would be 25 years before he would even be considered for parole .
The judge will also consider whether he is guilty of murder without premeditation : an intent to kill , but with no planning , in the heat of the moment .
Sentencing for a guilty verdict is at the judge ’s discretion .
There is also the possibility of a manslaughter , or culpable homicide , conviction , if the judge believes Pistorius’ claim that he did not mean to kill Steenkamp , but decides he acted recklessly or negligently in firing into the locked door .
Pistorius could be acquitted if the judge accepts his account that he genuinely feared for his life and thought he was acting in self - defence .
Alongside the charge of murder , Pistorius is accused of two counts of discharging firearms in public , and another of illegal possession of ammunition .
Discharging firearms in public , first count : The prosecution says he discharged a firearm at a restaurant in January 2013 .
Pistorius said his friend Darren Fresco had passed him the loaded gun and denies he deliberately pulled the trigger .
But the defence has now conceded that he should be found guilty of negligence on this charge .
Discharging firearms in public , second count : Pistorius is accused of firing a gun through a car sunroof while he was with Fresco and Pistorius’ then girlfriend Samantha Taylor in November 2012 .
The athlete says he became angry after a police officer inspected his gun when the car was stopped for speeding , but denies firing it .
Illegal possession of ammunition : Pistorius is charged with being in possession of .38 ammunition without a permit .
Pistorius told the court the bullets belonged to his father and he had them for safe - keeping .
If found guilty , Pistorius could face five years in prison on each of the first two firearms counts , and 15 years for the illegal possession of ammunition ."
2014-08-25,"They were bit players in a courtroom drama who suddenly found themselves uncomfortably centre stage , with the eyes of millions upon them and top lawyers trying to rip their credibility to shreds .
The 37 witnesses in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius ranged from experts and academics to unsuspecting members of the public for whom the witness stand felt more like the dock .
Now one has spoken of her experience in one of the world 's most watched criminal cases , saying : "" We feel trampled by a bus . ""
Annette Stipp and her husband , Johan , were neighbours of Pistorius called to testify for the prosecution about what they saw and heard in the early hours of Valentine 's day last year , when the Paralympian shot and killed his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp .
Pistorius claims it was an accident and is due to hear the judge 's verdict next month .
Stipp was subsequently interviewed for a research paper by South Africa 's National Prosecuting Authority .
She described giving evidence , and the aftermath , as "" emotional , daunting and exhausting "" , according to the country 's Times newspaper , which has seen the research .
Stipp felt as if she were being personally attacked and was not sure that she would go through it again .
Arriving in court for the first time in March was terrifying , Stipp said , although the anticipation was worse than the reality .
Stipp , who lives in direct line of sight to Pistorius 's former house in the Silver Woods country estate in Pretoria , testified that she heard a woman screaming on the morning of the killing .
She was then subjected to a tongue - lashing from the defence team .
In his final argument , defence counsel Barry Roux described the testimonies of Stipp and her husband as "" exaggerated and contradictory … creates doubt as to [ their ] reliability "" .
Stipp told the research team : "" You feel you are being attacked personally .
Your integrity is questioned .
We felt that [ we ] were being attacked as [ liars ] . ""
According to the Times , the research found that witnesses are often "" embarrassed "" by testifying in a room full of strangers in an "" intimidating court environment "" , and by often hostile cross - examination from lawyers trying to discredit them .
The research paper says many witnesses and victims are traumatised and suffer secondary victimisation on the witness stand , often during gruelling cross - examination by the likes of Roux and prosecutor Gerrie Nel , dubbed "" the pitbull "" .
This might lead to them refusing to participate in court cases , which might result in vigilantism , mob justice and other forms of anarchy .
On Monday another neighbour and prosecution witness , Charl Johnson , said he hoped future witnesses would not be deterred from coming forward .
"" My wish is that people are not discouraged , "" he commented by phone .
"" It 's not a pleasurable experience but one 's got to do what one feels is the right thing .
"" Roux 's hostile questioning of Johnson and his wife , Michelle Burger , surprised many TV viewers who had not previously watched criminal trials .
"" I would n't like to comment on our personal experience , "" Johnson added .
Roger Dixon , an expert witness for the defence with 18 years of experience in trials , said : "" For the layman , it can be very traumatic to stand up there .
You 're not just getting questioned on your personal knowledge but on yourself .
The system we have tries to break down your evidence and , if it ca n't do that , it tries to break you .
After six days in the box , you could see how Oscar Pistorius himself was getting confused . ""
He added : "" I think it has coloured people 's perception of what it 's like to be a witness in a case , especially a high profile case with strong legal eagles .
They are not going to spare you . """
2014-09-09,"As a crime writer , I 've thought a lot about murder .
Not just the technical or literary aspects , but also the seemingly insatiable public appetite for death .
Why are we all so interested ?
Nowhere is this obsession more evident than in the trial of former Olympic athlete Oscar Pistorius for the murder of his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp .
Proceedings in the Pretoria courtroom over the past year have garnered more international attention than any other South African event in the social media age â€ “ even the funeral of our former president , Nelson Mandela .
Every day the foreign media have packed the court to churn out hundreds of stories to a hungry audience already watching the trial on television and following every new theory on twitter .
Part of this fascination can perhaps be explained by Pistorius 's particular history and background : he 's an international superstar , a role model and a global symbol of triumph over tragedy .
But I believe it is wider than this .
I 've always had my theories , some of which I 've discussed with fellow crime authors .
The simplified consensus seems to be that our fascination stems from the fact that ( a ) death is our ultimate fear and ( b ) we are driven by an inner need for justice in an unjust world .
But after witnessing the Pistorius spectacle I wanted to find out more .
I contacted Professor Dap Louw , one of the world 's most experienced and respected forensic psychologists .
Over more than three decades , he has interviewed scores of South African killers , testified in countless trials and written and taught on the subject extensively . ""
The fixation with murder is real , "" Louw says .
"" There 's been a plethora of students clamouring to study in the field .
And I have to confess to the same obsession .
After a lifetime in psychology , murder is the only field that continues to intrigue me .
And the reason , I think , is human intellect .
We are a physically puny species , compared with nature 's really dangerous predators .
But evolution has developed our cognition into a lethal weapon , and honed our drive and skills to solve puzzles and problems . ""
Furthermore , we are social animals .
We invest huge amounts of time , money and energy to fit in , and protect the stability of our society .
Murder is the most violent and potent of society 's destabilisers .
It presents a dangerous puzzle , and we study it constantly in an effort to find a solution .
"" Evolution has turned the human brain into a pattern - finding machine , says Louw .
Our study of murder becomes a quest to find environmental or behavioural patterns , so that we can predict who will kill , and who will not .
If we can identify a trend then somehow it is less random , and perhaps we will be personally less at risk ?
The Pistorius trial is a case in point .
Observers have tried to suggest so - called gun culture was partly responsible for the death of Steenkamp .
But if you study the statistics , South Africa does not really have such a thing .
What about a "" Pistorius gun culture "" ?
After all , in the mid-1970s Pistorius 's father allegedly shot himself in the testicles while in the company of his then girlfriend , the former Miss Universe Anneline Kriel .
Apparently Henke Pistorius was cleaning his pistol in front of Kriel when the accident happened .
( He was not seriously injured . )
It has also been reported that the Pistorius family owned 55 firearms .
Surely , growing up in this environment must have influenced the Paralympian on that fatal night ? ""
Perhaps , "" says Louw . ""
But I 've been talking to serial killers and murderers for 35 years and so many have one thing in common : they say : ' I never thought I would be capable of such an act ' .
The more I study them , the more I am convinced that there is no reliable way to profile murderers .
I think some human beings have a genetic predisposition to kill , and others do not .
There is an X factor , a great unknown .
But I 'm sure it is there , waiting to be discovered . ""
Sure , a gun culture , or a traumatised youth , can contribute to pulling the X factor trigger .
But I 've seen it umpteen times
â€ “ two kids can come from the same parents , grow up in the same conditions , but only one will have the capacity to kill . ""
Whether or not he 's right , perhaps herein lies a clue to our fascination with murder trials and crime novels .
As well as looking for patterns and wondering whether there is anything we can do to protect ourselves , are we wondering whether , in the right ( wrong ? )
circumstances , we have it within us to kill ourselves ?

2014-09-10,"All eyes will be on the North Gauteng high court in South Africa as Judge Thokozile Masipa delivers judgment in the trial of Oscar Pistorius .
The Paralympian faces a premeditated murder charge after he fired four shots through a toilet door at his Pretoria home on Valentine 's Day 2013 , which killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp .
Pistorius claims he had mistaken her for an intruder .
He also faces two charges relating to firing a gun in a public space , and a separate charge for illegally possessing ammunition .
The potential verdicts include : Not guilty on all charges Should the athlete be found not guilty , he would leave court a free man .
Pistorius would then have his 1 m rand bail returned to him and would reserve the right to institute a civil case against the minister of police and justice for damages he felt he might have incurred during his prosecution .
Guilty on all charges Premeditated murder in South Africa carries a minimum sentence of life imprisonment , which constitutes 25 years .
Coupled with anything from two to five years in prison or a fine for the firearm and ammunition charges could see the athlete spend three decades in prison .
South African law does afford him a parole hearing after 25 years and , if released , will still be on parole for the rest of his life .
Guilty on firearm and ammunition charges , not guilty of premeditated murder but guilty of culpable homicide
In this scenario , Pistorius could face a fine or up to five years in prison for the firearm charges but Judge Masipa could find that the prosecution had not proved premeditated murder beyond reasonable doubt .
She could then still find Pistorius guilty of culpable homicide ( manslaughter ) which is a lesser charge than premeditated murder and focuses on negligence rather than intent .
There is no prescribed sentence for culpable homicide in South African law and the sentence can be decided at the discretion of the judge based on the weight of evidence and circumstances surrounding the incident .
Not guilty on firearm and ammunition charges but guilty on premeditated murder charge In this case , Pistorius will face a life sentence ( 25 years ) or more depending on whether Judge Masipa feels that there are aggravating circumstances .
Sentencing and appeal
Should scenarios one to three occur then the following process will unfold .
After Masipa delivers her verdict the court will adjourn and reconvene at another date for sentencing .
When court reconvenes both the prosecution and defence will present mitigating and aggravating circumstances to be considered by Judge Masipa during her sentencing .
After considering both arguments , she will deliver her sentence .
After the sentence is delivered , Pistorius will have a chance to appeal both conviction and sentence .
He can also be granted bail at the judge 's discretion .
However , these bail conditions will come with heavy conditions such as house arrest or reporting to a police station once a week ."

2014-09-10,"Judge Thokozile Masipa , a black former journalist once arrested and thrown in prison for taking part in a protest , gazed across the courtroom at witness Tom Wolmarans , a white ex - policeman .
Thirty years ago they were on opposite sides of the violent political divide .
Today , she embodied the majesty of the law and he addressed her as "" Ma'am "" .
This was just one of the historical intrigues in the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp .
Before the eyes of millions , a Zulu judge raised in a township presided over two Afrikaner lawyers and a wealthy Afrikaner accused .
None was speaking their first language , since South African court hearings are conducted in English .
At the end of each day , family members , expert witnesses and lawyers would file out of the wood - panelled courtroom in Pretoria and cleaning staff would file in , a crossroads of class and race .
South Africa itself has been on trial over the past six months .
The world has been told of police bungling and dishonesty but been given a rather more flattering picture of the judicial system .
It has tried to decide whether this is a case of domestic violence or fear of residential crime â€ “ twin demons that torment South Africa .
It has seen how much has changed in this country since the end of racial apartheid in 1994 , and how much has stayed the same .
"" What is playing out in the North Gauteng high court is more than just a murder trial , "" wrote Mondli Makhanya , a columnist at City Press newspaper .
"" It is South Africa holding up a mirror to herself . ""
The notion that Masipa , who began studying law during apartheid and became only the second black woman appointed to the high court , is holding 27-year - old Pistorius 's fate in her hands would once have been unthinkable .
Nomavenda Mathiane , a former newspaper colleague , said : "" It 's such a great thing to see this woman from the dusty streets of the township standing in judgment over this young white man who had it all .
It makes me proud and I tell my children that anyone can make it with determination . ""
From a very different starting point , Wolmarans did national service for the apartheid government , became a police ballistics expert and also worked for Ian Smith 's regime in what is now Zimbabwe .
He left the country the day that Robert Mugabe became leader of a black government .
"" I 've never been racist , "" Wolmarans , 68 , said in a recent interview .
"" I worked for the state but I 've always been objective in my career .
I 've always given the benefit of the doubt , whether it was to a black man or a white man . ""
Wolmarans recalled a case in the late apartheid years in which he gave evidence that led to the acquittal of a black man accused of killing his girlfriend .
He added : "" I 've experienced black judges who are brilliant and white judges who are brilliant , and both who are not so brilliant .
I 've got no problem at all with black judges . ""
Over 41 court days , justice in South Africa was under scrutiny as never before .
The police 's reputation took a hammering as Pistorius 's lawyers exposed flaws in their investigation , contamination of evidence and even the apparent theft of the athlete 's designer watches .
This indictment came against a backdrop of nationwide concerns over police brutality and criminality that peaked in the 2012 massacre of 34 striking mineworkers in Marikana .
Johan Burger , a former police officer and now a senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies in Pretoria , said : "" It was a very bad performance by the police .
I know there are many good police people and very dedicated investigators , but what happened there is absolutely shameful and I think it did a lot of damage to the image of the police , especially because people internationally started showing huge interest . ""
It showed the worst of the police , and as a former policeman that was a huge embarrassment to me to see these things being admitted , and the police being accused of stealing stuff .
Not just a shoddy investigation , not just a shoddy way of dealing with a crime scene , but actually stealing stuff , which is criminal .
That is beyond any excuse . ""
For many , however , there was redemption in the way South Africa defied outsiders ' expectations of a kangaroo court .
In the austere setting with its rules and rituals , prosecutor Gerrie Nel and defence counsel Barry Roux gave the 37 witnesses no quarter , not least Pistorius himself , whose celebrity and wealth meant nothing against Nel 's fierce onslaught .
But above all there was Masipa , a red - robed figure of quiet dignity and gravitas who kept both lawyers in check and strove for a fair trial .
She remained inscrutable as the court heard how Pistorius allegedly reacted angrily to a police officer who pulled him over , and fired a gun into the air .
Mark Gevisser , a South African author and journalist , said : "" There were two images being projected .
One was of a society , and a section of society , that is violent , self - obsessed and contemptuous of the law .
It was a lawlessness that represents a certain kind of South African impulse , not just an Afrikaner impulse . ""
In contrast to that there was a cool , rational , empathetic , thoughtful court headed by a black woman .
She was so neutral in the right way .
For most people watching , her race became irrelevant from early on because she was so professional . ""
But when Gevisser did consider her race , he was proud .
"" I Googled her and saw her history under apartheid and thought , ' How incredible . '
I 'm often looking for indices of change in our society .
This was a reminder to me how far we 've come in 20 years . ""
Critics pointed out , however , that while Pistorius 's riches and the high profile of the case ensured the world saw South African justice at its best , it was not representative of the incompetence and long delays that often plague the trial of an accused from a township .
The court heard from a procession of witnesses , including middle - class professionals who lived in Pistorius 's gated community , a less savoury crowd he socialised with , and experts with thinning hair and widening girth .
Nearly all were white .
So were most of the attorneys and junior counsels , and most of the pundits filling hours of commentary .
Makhanya wrote : "" Oh , but there were some blacks who have played a role in this trial .
There was the security guard from Pistorius 's complex .
There have also been the interpreters and court orderlies .
And yes , there is judge Thokozile Masipa and her assessors , the most senior people in the court .
But the fact they are drops in an ocean of whiteness is something that should disturb South Africans in this 20th year of our democracy .
"" One more black person haunted the trial .
When Pistorius claimed he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder , shooting four times , he was tapping into the paranoid imagination of suburban South Africa , the long - honed fear of an armed and dangerous black intruder , according to the crime novelist Margie Orford . ""
That fear of crime is a deeply racialised pathology in South Africa , "" she said .
"" What was very interesting to me was Pistorius 's extremely experienced lawyer seemed to be caught with the idea that the imaginary intruder , that mythic danger , would excuse all behaviour .
"" Most victims of murder in South Africa are young black men in poor areas , not the high - security gated communities where Pistorius lived .
Orford added : "" The bogeyman is like a vampire .
As soon as you put the light on it , it disappears .
What we saw is how much time is spent fearing something that does not exist .
Yes , there is crime , yes , there is murder , but it is in a specific place and in specific ways .
"" The women 's league of the African National Congress has been a constant presence in the public gallery at the high court .
South Africa has one of the highest rates of intimate partner homicide in the world .
In 2009 it was estimated that a woman was killed by her husband or boyfriend every eight hours â€ “ more commonly than by strangers .
A fifth - generation Afrikaner , Pistorius has a historical context of his own .
Afrikaners are descended from predominantly Dutch settlers who arrived in the Cape in the 17th and 18th centuries .
They carved out a distinct identity around the Afrikaans language , Calvinist religion and a frontier spirit .
Declaring independence from the British empire , they loaded up ox - wagons and trekked north into the interior , creating the Boer republics , fighting a war and founding a mythology .
By the mid-20th century , there was an Afrikaner government with a policy of apartheid .
Burger said : "" Afrikaners have always seen themselves as fighting for survival as a group since the days when Jan van Riebeeck came here in 1652 .
Then there was the groot trek [ great trek ] because the English wanted to dominate and take away the language and other cultural things very important to the Afrikaner .
After the Anglo - Boer war , when the Afrikaner community started to establish themselves , they always faced the threat of a black majority and they had to devise ways and means to survive and the only way they saw fit at the time was through this whole policy of keeping people apart . ""
Guns , fear of God , patriarchy , self - sufficiency and social conservatism are all stereotypes that certainly do not apply to all Afrikaners today , but which seem to find resonance in Pistorius . ""
He constructed a narrative of triumph over adversity through Afrikaner Calvinist hard work , "" Gevisser observed .
The court heard about the athlete 's obsession with firearms : he had placed an order for three shotguns , two revolvers and a rifle at the time he killed Steenkamp .
He also spoke passionately about the Christian faith that has sustained both him and his family .
A tattoo on his left shoulder quotes a Bible verse from Corinthians that begins : "" I do not run like a man running aimlessly "" .
Then there was the sense of rugged individualism because central authority can not be relied upon .
Giving evidence during the trial , Pistorius recalled : "" My family have always believed in standing up for yourself and standing up for what you believe in .
I come from a family where we were taught that we do n't cry to our parents at the end of the day .
I remember a situation where my buttons got torn off my shirt and my mother sent me to school the next day and said to me if my shirt came back that way the next day , I should send it home with the other kids ' parents , and it happened the next day and I got called into the headmaster 's office .
"" I stood up for myself and I got into a physical altercation with this other kid .
When I got called in my mother arrived and she just basically said to the headmaster that she does n't think it 's wrong for her kids to stand up for what they believe in , and for getting bullied , and she would n't be back , and she gave the shirt to the kids ' parents and told them to bring it back when it was repaired . ""
Afrikaners now make up about 5 % of the South African population .
Some believe Afrikaner culture , language and identity are under threat and point to the relatively high murder rate of farmers .
A small minority of hardliners never stopped regarding Nelson Mandela as a terrorist and fear that his death last year could trigger racial conflagration .
Some are said to have undergone military training to defend themselves and stockpiled cans of food in bunkers .
Gevisser said : "" During the trial I thought a lot about frontiers and the laager [ an encampment formed by a circle of wagons ] .
I asked myself , the question how many countries in the world would it even be considered to be self - defence to shoot through a locked door ?
It says something about a certain white South African consciousness of siege and frontier that goes beyond not having legs .
"" More recently in South African history there was the armed struggle for and against apartheid .
The country was awash with guns in both black and white hands .
Nel said during the trial that he understood Pistorius 's family owned 50 or more guns .
The Paralympian testified that his mother kept a pistol under her pillow when he was a child .
"" I think everybody in South Africa 's been exposed to crime at some point , "" he said .
"" We had many house break - ins when I was growing up . ""
Burger added : "" We all grew up with guns and remember we came through a period before 1994 where we were all trained , whites and blacks in this country , in the handling of military firearms â€ ¦
Apart from that , South Africa became a very violent society , especially in the 1980s .
There were mass murders in this country , political violence , young children under 10 dancing around , burning adults and it was just incredible to see , and this is what they grew up with . ""
Violence became ingrained .
South Africa became a very militarised , violent society in the 1980s , and this is why I think many people saw 1994 as a miracle .
Whether the miracle still lives on is a debatable issue .
At the time , the miracle was that most of us thought South Africa was going up in flames .
Guns became part of the lives of everybody in this country . ""
But post - apartheid legislation meant that many guns were handed in .
The international weapons - monitoring organisation
GunPolicy estimates that there are now about 6 m guns , or 12 for every 100 people in South Africa .
"" I only have one handgun , "" Burger said .
"" I hold on to it more for sentimental reasons than anything . ""
But some commentators reject Makhanya 's idea that the Pistorius trial held up a mirror to South African society .
Was that , after all , less interesting than this unique story about an individual psychological disaster ?
Jonny Steinberg , an author and academic , said : "" What struck me about the trial was how faint the historical resonances were .
That the judge was a black woman , the accused a white man , was not the defining issue .
In some ways we 've moved on and 20 years really is a long time . ""
When the court adjourned each day , however , the demographics were insistent .
The job of tidying away discarded coffee cups and crisp packets , vacuuming the carpet and dusting the totemic bullet - pierced door fell to uniformed cleaners , all of whom were black .
Among them was Mapula Mawasha , a 52-year - old grandmother commuting from a township .
Her view of Pistorius was clear . ""
The Bible says you must not kill , "" she said ."

2014-09-11,"My colleague David Smith has filed his report from Pretoria , which you can read here .
Despite the not guilty finding on the charges of murder , it is not over for Pistorius or the family of Reeva Steenkamp : Judge Thokozile Masipa said it was clear Pistorius had acted unlawfully in shooting the person behind the toilet door on Valentineâ€ ™ s Day last year .
She said a â€œreasonable personâ€ � would not have fired four shots into the toilet cubicle , and that Pistorius acted â€œtoo hastily and used excessive force â€ ¦
It is clear his conduct was negligent.â€
�
The court will resume on Friday to hear her decision on whether the athlete was guilty of culpable homicide , which could result in a prison sentence of up to 15 years .
The not guilty verdicts will bring some relief to his family , who were in court to support him every day , and the legion of fans who believed in him .
It even raises the prospect that the Paralympian could one day resurrect his career on the track .
But the judgment is likely to be condemned by friends and supporters of Steenkamp , including the African National Congress womenâ€ ™ s league , who were regularly represented in the public gallery and danced and sang outside court on Thursday .
It will also fuel fears that Pistorius has received preferential treatment because of his wealth and fame .
Thatâ€ ™ s it for the live blog for today .
I will be back on Friday morning when the judge will resume her ruling .
Thank you for reading .
Judge Masipa did not give her verdict today â€ “ that will come on Friday morning .
But she has effectively ruled out the possibility that Oscar Pistorius will be found guilty of the murder of Reeva Steenkamp .
The judge said the state had failed to prove premeditated murder and the evidence was â€œpurely circumstantialâ€ � .
He will also not be found guilty of murder without premeditation ( dolus eventualis ) , as Masipa says there was not sufficient evidence to suggest that he had foreseen that his actions could result in the death of the person behind the toilet door .
Nonetheless , Masipa said it was clear that Pistorius had acted unlawfully in shooting the person behind the door .
A reasonable person would not have fired four shots into the toilet cubicle , because he would have foreseen the consequences : that somebody could be killed .
Pistorius acted â€œtoo hastily and used excessive force â€ ¦
It is clear his conduct was
negligent.â€ �
But the judge adjourned the hearing for the day before delivering what many observers in and outside the court expected to be a guilty verdict on the charge of culpable homicide ( manslaughter ) .
Masipa said Pistorius was a â€œvery poor witnessâ€ � , but that untruthfulness does not in itself mean an accused is guilty .
You can read more detail of the judgment , which explain the judgeâ€ ™ s conclusions , here : Masipa said it â€œmakes senseâ€ � that the screaming heard by neighbours was Pistorius and not Steenkamp .
The evidence of neighbours is â€œfallibleâ€ � and some â€ “ such as that of Michelle Burger and her husband Charl Johnson â€ “ should be rejected entirely .
Masipa accepts the defence timetable that shots were fired at around 3.12am , meaning screams heard after this time could not have been those of the victim .
The sounds heard at 3.17am were the cricket bat breaking the door , as the defence maintained .
But she says that Pistoriusâ€ ™ evidence that if he had wanted to kill the perceived intruder , he would have fired higher is â€œinconsistent with someone who shot without thinkingâ€ � .
Defence claims that police tampered with the scene â€œpale into insignificanceâ€ � in the face of other evidence .
WhatsApp messages between the couple â€œprove
nothingâ€ � for either side .
Evidence from Steenkampâ€ ™ s stomach contents that she ate later than Pistorius claimed is â€œinconclusiveâ€ � and in any case does not help the stateâ€ ™ s case .
And a summary of key quotes from the judge is here .
AFP has put together this compilation of key quotes from Judge Masipaâ€ ™ s ruling so far : On the stateâ€ ™ s case â€œThe state clearly has not proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of premeditated murder.â€ � â€œViewed in its totality , the evidence failed to establish that the accused had the requisite intention to kill the deceased , let alone with premeditation.â€ �
â€œThe accused therefore can not be found guilty of murder.â€ �
On Pistoriusâ€ ™ s actions â€œHe took a conscious decision , he knew where he kept his firearm and he knew where his bathroom was .
This is inconsistent with lack of criminal capacity.â€ �
â€œThe intention to shoot however does not necessarily include the intention to kill.â€ � â€œClearly he did not subjectively * foresee this as a possibility that he would kill the person behind the door.â€ �
On Pistoriusâ€ ™ s own testimony â€œThe accused was a very poor witness.â€
�
â€œThe accused was , amongst other things an evasive witness.â€ � â€œHe failed to listen properly to questions put to him under cross - examination , giving the impression that he was more worried by the impact his answers might cause rather than the questions asked.â€ �
On neighboursâ€ ™ testimony â€œMost witnesses had their facts wrong.â€ �
â€œI am of the view that they failed to separate what they knew personally or what they heard from other people or what they gathered from the media.â€
�
On messages between Pistorius and Steenkamp â€œNeither the evidence of the loving relationship or a relationship turned sour can assist this court to determine whether the accused had the requisite intention to kill the deceased.â€ �
[ * 14.43BST edit : AFP had this as â€œobjectivelyâ€ � , which was originally reproduced here ; â€œsubjectivelyâ€ � is correct . ]
The judgeâ€ ™ s decision to rule out murder by dolus eventualis â€ “
that is , that Pistorius foresaw that his actions in firing four shots into the door could have led to the death of the person behind it , but went ahead anyway
â€ “ has attracted many questions and some criticism .
I am not an expert in South African law .
But this would seem to be a reasonably convincing and accessible explanation of the distinction between murder by dolus eventualis ( of which we know Pistorius will be found not guilty ) and culpable homicide ( on which the judge will rule on Friday ) : This interpretation suggests the judge has accepted Pistoriusâ€ ™ argument that he did not think his actions would lead to the death of the person â€ “ whether Steenkamp or an intruder â€ “ behind the door .
But if she decides that a reasonable person should have foreseen that , she can find him guilty of culpable homicide .
Pistorius is now leaving the courtoom .
He will be back tomorrow morning to hear whether Masipa deems him guilty of the culpable homicide of Reeva Steenkamp , along with verdicts on three other firearms charges .
Reporters in Pretoria say Pistorius remains in the courtroom with his family .
A confusing end to the day
â€ “ Judge Masipa seemed to be moving towards a verdict on the charge of culpable homicide but abruptly broke off to adjourn for the day .
The court will be back on Friday morning , presumably to hear her decision on that charge right away .
Her latest comments certainly seemed to indicate she was moving in the direction of a guilty verdict on culpable homicide ( manslaughter ) : she said Pistorius had â€œacted too hastilyâ€ � , â€œused excessive forceâ€ � , was â€œclearlyâ€ � negligent , and could have called for help instead of approaching the bathroom with a loaded firearm .
But we will not now find out until Friday .
Masipa says Pistorius acted â€œtoo hastily and used excessive force â€ ¦
It is clear his conduct was negligent.â€
�
And with that , court adjourns for the day .
She says a reasonable person would have taken steps to guard against that possibility .
Masipa says that if Pistorius had woken to see a â€œsilhouetteâ€ � by his bed and shot that figure , even if it turned out to be Steenkamp , he would have acted reasonably .
But she does not think a reasonable person would have fired four shots into the toilet cubicle .
A reasonable person would have foreseen that the person inside could have been struck and could have died .
Masipa :
I agree that the conduct of the accused may be better understood by looking at his background .
However , the explanation of the conduct of the accused is just that : an explanation .
It does not excuse the conduct of the accused .
Many [ people ] have been victims of violent crimes but they have not resorted to sleeping with firearms under their pillows .
Pistorius could have picked up his phone and called the police or security , Masipa says .
He could have run to his balcony and screamed for help .
There was no reason why he could not do so before he ventured into the bathroom with a loaded firearm .
Masipa says background , education , sex , race and culture of the accused must be taken into account when considering the reasonableness of his actions .
She says the defence tried to persuade the court that his disability rendered him so vulnerable that his acquiring of the firearm could not be called negligent .
The judge says millions of people could fit into this category .
Masipa does not explain the delay .
She starts right away with discussion of culpable homicide and negligence .
The criminal test relies on whether a reasonable person in the same circumstances would have foreseen the possible consequences .
Judge Masipa is â€ “ after a rather longer break than expected â€ “ back to deal with the question of culpable homicide ( manslaughter ) .
Barry Roux and Gerrie Nel have now returned to the courtroom .
Hopefully Judge Masipa is not far behind .
Reporters in court in Pretoria says prosecutor Gerrie Nel has entered the room , only to leave again immediately with lead defence counsel Barry Roux .
The Guardian video team has put together this summary of the judgeâ€ ™ s ruling so far : We expected the court to have resumed by now but the judge is not back .
Nor yet is the prosecution team .
All other parties appear to be back in the room .
There is much discussion â€ “ in court and online â€ “ about the judgeâ€ ™ s interpretation of dolus eventualis : whether , in firing four shots into the door , Pistorius should have foreseen the possibility that he would kill the person behind it .
Masipa ruled that there was not evidence to show that he did .
Here is a report of proceedings so far â€ “ a reminder that , although Judge Masipa has ruled out a murder conviction , she has not yet delivered her verdict : A South African judge has ruled there is not sufficient evidence to find the Olympic and Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius guilty of murder over the fatal shooting of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp .
Judge Thokozile Masipa told the court in Pretoria that Pistorius â€œdid not subjectively foresee this as a possibility that he would kill the person behind the door , let alone the deceasedâ€ � .
Tears streamed down the 27-year - old athleteâ€ ™ s face as the judge delivered her verdict in the hearing , which is still ongoing .
She had earlier cleared him of the most serious charge , premeditated murder , saying the state had failed to make its case against him and the evidence was â€œpurely circumstantialâ€ � .
Pistorius killed Steenkamp at his home on 14 February 2013 when he fired a gun through the closed door of his toilet .
He had told the court he thought he was shooting at an intruder .
Masipa is still to rule on the lesser charge of culpable homicide and could acquit Pistorius if she believes he shot her by mistake .
There are protests in support of Reeva Steenkamp outside the high court today .
The ANC Womenâ€ ™ s League has supported the Steenkamp family throughout the trial , with representatives accompanying June Steenkamp , Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s mother , to court .
My colleague Viasen Soobramoney sends this :
Culpable homicide in South Africa is defined as the â€˜unlawful negligent killing of a human beingâ€ ™ .
It is a charge that focusses on negligence rather than intent .
An example of culpable homicide could be reckless driving that results in a personâ€ ™ s death .
There is no prescribed sentence for culpable homicide and the judge can use her discretion in sentencing based on the circumstances of the case .
We have not yet had an official verdict from Judge Masipa .
But she has explicitly stated in the course of reading her judgment that there is not sufficient evidence to find Pistorius guilty of the murder â€ “ premeditated or not â€ “ of Reeva Steenkamp .
The judge said the state had failed to prove premeditated murder and the evidence was â€œpurely circumstantialâ€ � .
He will also not be found guilty of murder without premeditation ( dolus eventualis ) , as Masipa says it was not proved that he had foreseen that his actions could result in the death of the person behind the toilet door .
Nonetheless , Masipa said it was clear that Pistorius had acted unlawfully in shooting the person behind the door .
She will return after lunch to deliver her decision on whether he is guilty of culpable homicide .
She said Pistorius was a â€œvery poor witnessâ€ � , but that untruthfulness does not in itself mean an accused is guilty .
You can read more detail of the judgment , which explain the judgeâ€ ™ s conclusions , here : Masipa said it â€œmakes senseâ€ � that the screaming heard by neighbours was Pistorius and not Steenkamp .
The evidence of neighbours is â€œfallibleâ€ � and some â€ “ such as that of Michelle Burger and her husband Charl Johnson â€ “ should be rejected entirely .
Masipa accepts the defence timetable that shots were fired at around 3.12am , meaning screams heard after this time could not have been those of the victim .
The sounds heard at 3.17am were the cricket bat breaking the door , as the defence maintained .
But she says that Pistoriusâ€ ™ evidence that if he had wanted to kill the perceived intruder , he would have fired higher is â€œinconsistent with someone who shot without thinkingâ€ � .
Defence claims that police tampered with the scene â€œpale into insignificanceâ€ � in the face of other evidence .
WhatsApp messages between the couple â€œprove
nothingâ€ � for either side .
Evidence from Steenkampâ€ ™ s stomach contents that she ate later than Pistorius claimed is â€œinconclusiveâ€ � and in any case does not help the stateâ€ ™ s case .
The judge says she will return after lunch to the question of whether Pistorius is guilty of the culpable homicide â€ “ manslaughter â€ “ of Reeva Steenkamp .
The could be a manslaughter , or culpable homicide , conviction , if the judge believes Pistoriusâ€ ™ claim that he did not mean to kill Steenkamp , but decides he acted recklessly or negligently in firing into the locked door .
There is no minimum sentence in South African law for culpable homicide : it would be at the discretion of the judge .
Otherwise , given that murder charges have been dismissed , Pistorius could be acquitted if the judge accepts his account that he genuinely feared for his life and thought he was acting in self - defence .
Alongside the charge of murder , Pistorius is accused of two counts of discharging firearms in public , and another of illegal possession of ammunition .
Pistorius can not be found guilty of murder .
But a verdict of culpable homicide still possible .
Court adjourns for lunch .
The question is now whether Pistorius proceeded â€œrecklesslyâ€ � , with reasonable foresight that the person behind the door would be killed ?
Masipa says the answer has to be no .
Masipa says evidence does not support the stateâ€ ™ s case that this was dolus eventualis ( he must have known he was likely to kill the person by firing ) .
He believed Steenkamp was in the bedroom .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ account of this has remained consistent since the night of the shooting .
It is â€œhighly improbable the accused would have made this up so quicklyâ€ � .
Masipa :
There is no doubt that when the accused fired shots at the door he acted unlawfully .
Masipa says that , on his own version , Pistorius genuinely â€ “ though wrongly â€ “ thought his life , and that of Steenkamp , were in danger .
There is nothing in the evidence to suggest this belief was not honestly obtained .
Masipa :
The accused is the only person who can say what his state of mind was at the time he fired the shots that killed the deceased .
The accused has not admitted that he had the intention to shoot and kill the deceased or any other person .
On the contrary , he stated he had no intention to shoot or kill the deceased .
Masipa says a person who kills in â€œprivate defenceâ€ � acts lawfully as long as the court decides a reasonable person would have acted in the same way .
Masipa runs through the law dealing with whether an accused should â€œreasonably have
foreseenâ€ � that his actions could result in a personâ€ ™ s death .
The judge rules that this case is not a case of aberratio ictus , but error in persona : the blow ( shot ) was intended for the person behind the door .
The fact that the person behind the door turned out to be the deceased and not an intruder is irrelevant â€ ¦
The question is whether the accused had the intention to kill the person behind the door .
Masipa describes principle of â€œaberratio ictusâ€ �
â€ “ where an accused A , shooting at B , instead hits
C. She runs through complicated scenarios and case law , concerned with intention and whether â€œtransferred
maliceâ€ � can apply .
Effectively , this deals with Pistoriusâ€ ™ culpability if the court accepts that he meant to shoot an intruder , but instead shot Steenkamp .
Reporters in court say the response to the judgeâ€ ™ s decision that Pistorius can not be found guilty of premeditated murder has been muted .
He can , of course , still be found guilty of murder , if the judge decides that â€ “ pre - planning aside â€ “ he armed himself and shot with the intention to kill .
He could also face a conviction for culpable homicide if she decides there was no intent .
Or , of course , he could be acquitted if Masipa decides he acted reasonably out of fear that an intruder was going to attack him .
Judge Masipa takes a short break .
Court will resume in a few minutes .
Masipa says state failed to prove that Pistorius is guilty of pre - meditated murder .
On the count of premeditated murder , the judge says the evidence is â€œpurely circumstantialâ€ � .
Masipa says Pistorius was â€œnot truthfulâ€ � about his intention when arming himself with a loaded gun before approaching the bathroom .
This doesnâ€ ™ t necessarily mean he is guilty , she adds .
Masipa says Steenkamp was killed under â€œpeculiar circumstancesâ€ � that do not make sense .
Why did Pistorius not check where she was before making his way to the bathroom ?
Why did Steenkamp not call the police , as Pistorius said he shouted to her to do , as she had her cellphone with her in the toilet ?
Why did Steenkamp not hear him shout â€œat the top of his voiceâ€ � for the intruder to get out of his house ?
Unfortunately , this issues remain an issue of conjecture , the judge says .
But Masipa says that an assumption that because an accused is untruthful , he must be guilty , â€œmust be guided againstâ€ � .
Masipa says Pistorius â€œwas a very poor witnessâ€ � .
He lost his composure under cross - examination .
She says the defence claim that he was anxious and on medication â€œdoes not make senseâ€ � :
The accusedâ€ ™ s
performance in evidence in chief could not be faulted â€
¦
It was only under cross - examination that he contradicted himself .
The accused was , among other things , an evasive witness â€ ¦
He gave the impression that he was more worried about the impact his answers might have than the questions asked .
Often a question requiring a straightforward answer turned into a point of debate about what another witness said or did .
Masipa :
The decision to convict or acquit must be based on all the evidence â€ ¦
Some of it may be found to be unreliable â€ ¦
But none of it may simply be ignored .
Masipa says the intention to shoot does not automatically mean an intention to kill .
In this case , the only real point of dispute is whether Pistorius intended to kill when he pulled the trigger .
The onus of proof is on the state , she adds , to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt .
Masipa now turns to the issue of putative self - defence : that Pistorius thought an intruder was coming out of the toilet to attack him and so fired to defend himself .
But if the accused â€ “ as he claims â€ “ never intended to shoot anyone , he can not rely on putative self - defence , the judge says .
She refers to the â€œstrange conductâ€ � of the accused : Professor Derman testified that he had an exaggerated fight ( rather than flight ) instinct in the face of danger .
It is â€œunderstandableâ€
� that a person with Pistoriusâ€ ™ disability would feel vulnerable , she says , but he is â€œnot unique in this respectâ€
�
: Would it be reasonable if , without further ado , they armed themselves with a firearm â€
¦
I do not think so .
The defence of criminal capacity has â€œno foundationâ€ � , Judge Masipa rules .
But the defence still insisted , based on the evidence of Professor Wayne Derman , that the court ought to consider that the accused lacked criminal capacity at the time because of his exaggerated startle response â€ “ a result of his disability and anxiety .
I disagree with this â€ “ there is a huge difference between a reflex action and an involuntary action .
There was no lapse of memory or any confusion on the part of the accused .
He froze , then decided to arm himself and go to the bathroom
â€
¦
He took a conscious decision .
This is inconsistent with lack of criminal capacity .
First , did Pistorius lack criminal capacity at the time ?
Could he distinguish between right and wrong , and act in accordance with this ?
Masipa says it became necessary for the court to refer Pistorius for psychiatric observation .
She runs through the panel of health professionals who assessed and reported on his mental health .
They found he did not have a mental disorder or defect that would have affected his ability to distinguish between right and wrong , and act on that .
Masipa picks up where she left off : did the accused intend to shoot ?
The defence submitted that Pistorius was â€œvulnerable and fearfulâ€
� .
She will deal with the â€œplethoraâ€ � of defences one - by - one .
Judge Masipa is back in the courtroom and about to resume the reading of her judgment .
Judge Masipa has not yet delivered her verdict on whether Pistorius is guilty of the murder of Reeva Steenkamp , but is explaining her judgment : She said it â€œmakes senseâ€ � that the screaming heard by neighbours was Pistorius and not Steenkamp .
The evidence of neighbours is â€œfallibleâ€ � and some â€ “ such as that of Michelle Burger and her husband Charl Johnson â€ “ should be rejected entirely .
Masipa accepts the defence timetable that shots were fired at around 3.12am , meaning screams heard after this time could not have been those of the victim .
The sounds heard at 3.17am were the cricket bat breaking the door , as the defence maintained .
But she says that Pistoriusâ€ ™ evidence that if he had wanted to kill the perceived intruder , he would have fired higher is â€œinconsistent with someone who shot without thinkingâ€ � .
Defence claims that police tampered with the scene â€œpale into insignificanceâ€ � in the face of other evidence .
WhatsApp messages between the couple â€œprove
nothingâ€ � for either side .
Evidence from Steenkampâ€ ™ s stomach contents that she ate later than Pistorius claimed is â€œinconclusiveâ€ � and in any case does not help the stateâ€ ™ s case .
Pistorius told the court he did not think about pulling the trigger .
He said he never thought of the possibility that he could kill somebody inside the toilet .
If he had wanted to kill the perceived intruder , he would have fired higher , he told the court .
Masipa says that explanation is â€œinconsistent with someone who shot without thinkingâ€ � .
She says she will return to this point later .
Court now adjourns for a tea break .
Pistorius said : â€œThe accident was that I discharged my firearm in the belief an intruder was coming out to attack me.â€
�
So was the discharge of the firearm accidental , Masipa asks .
Masipa runs through the defences : it was an accident .
he never intended to kill anyone .
he did not purposefully fire into the door .
he did fire into the door but did not do so deliberately .
he did not aim at the door but the gun was pointed at the door .
he did not mean to pull the trigger but did so in fright .
he did not have time to think before firing .
he believed someone was coming out of the cubicle to attack him .
The judge says the accusedâ€ ™ s evidence â€œoffers a number of defencesâ€ � : On the version of the accused it was not quite clear if he intended to shoot or not .
She cites the evidence of defence witness and forensic psychologist Dr Merryl Vorster , who queried whether Pistorius was responsible for his actions , due to an anxiety disorder .
Masipa says that once Pistorius had broken down the door with the cricket bat he found Steenkamp lying in a sitting position with her head on the toilet bowl .
She quotes Pistorius : Before I knew it , I had fired four shots at the door .
The judge is running through Pistoriusâ€ ™ version of events and the moment at which he says he heard what he thought to be an intruder .
Masipa notes that a security guard passed the Pistorius house at 2.20am and heard no argument .
She now turns to the defence case .
She now turns to the disputed evidence over when Steenkamp ate her last meal .
The state says her stomach contents suggest she ate much later than the 7 pm claimed by Pistorius .
Masipa says the evidence on this is inconclusive .
But she says that , even if it were agreed that Steenkamp ate much later , it does not help the stateâ€ ™ s case .
You could draw more than one inference from it .
The judge turns to the WhatsApp messages between the couple , in which Steenkamp said she was â€œscaredâ€ � of her boyfriend .
In my view none of this evidence , from the state or defence , proves anything .
Normal relationships are dynamic and unpredictable sometimes .
Can the version of the accused that he was the one screaming â€œreasonably possibly be trueâ€ � , Masipa asks .
The state says Pistorius and Steenkamp had an argument , and that the accused killed her â€œin
the heatâ€ � of this argument , the judge reminds the court .
The prosecution queried why Steenkamp had her cell phone with her in the toilet .
Masipa says she might have taken it with her to light the way to the toilet .
But to pick a reason â€œis to delve into the realm of speculationâ€ � .
The calls to security give credibility to the timings for the gunshots given by the defence .
There are inconsistencies in the accounts of neighbours who testified for the state , Masipa says .
Anette Stippâ€ ™ s timings were wrong , she says ; it was â€œmore
probableâ€ � that the shots were later than the time she mentioned .
Masipa says evidence from defence witnesses , Pistoriusâ€ ™ closest neighbours , casts doubt on state witnesses who said they heard a woman scream .
The defence witnesses said it was a man â€
“ Pistorius â€ “ crying .
This has the â€œring of truthâ€ � , the judge says .
Judge Masipa delves immediately into the analysis of the first sounds at 3.12/3.13am .
These were identified by the defence as the fatal shots ; this was not disproved by the state .
The screams heard after this time could not have been Reeva Steenkamp .
Has the state proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had â€œdirect intention and premeditation to kill the deceasedâ€ � , Masipa posits , before taking a short break .
Court adjourns .
The judgeâ€ ™ s interpretation of the timeline of events â€ “ notably , accepting the defence chronology â€ “ suggests she will rule out premeditation .
But Pistorius can still be found guilty of murder if the judge believes he intended to kill Steenkamp or a perceived intruder .
The judge accepts the defence timeline that shots were fired at around 3.12am .
( The state alleged that noises heard at 3.17am were the gunshots ; the defence maintained this was the cricket bat breaking down the door . )
This is crucial .
The major dispute in chronology between state and defence is over the timing of the shots and the cricket bat .
The judge says it would be unwise to rely on any evidence about what witnesses â€ “ for state and defence â€ “ heard without testing it against objective evidence .
She says the court is lucky to have evidence that is more reliable than human memory : phone records , for example .
Masipa dismisses the defence claim that witness Dr Stipp tailored his evidence to help the state .
He had no reason to do so , she says .
She singles out the evidence of Darren Fresco , who testified about the two incidents in which Pistorius is alleged to have fired guns in public .
The defence says Pistorius screamed when he realised Steenkamp was not in the bedroom .
That has not been contradicted , the judge says , and it â€œmakes
senseâ€ � .
This is crucial , as the evidence that Steenkamp was screaming was a major plank of the prosecutionâ€ ™ s case for premeditation .
Masipa moves on to Steenkampâ€ ™ s â€œhorrendousâ€ � injuries .
A person sustaining a wound of this nature
â€ ¦ would probably be immediately unconscious .
She would not have been able to make voluntary movement , Masipa adds .
Steenkamp probably did not breathe for more than a few seconds after receiving the wounds , the judge says .
It is unlikely she would have been able to scream .
The only other person who could have screamed is the accused .
The question is , why did he scream ?
The defence claimed Pistorius sounds like a woman when he screams .
The judge says it is difficult to know the truth of this as nobody â€ “ including his former girlfriend Samantha Taylor â€ “ had heard him scream in this kind of life - threatening situation .
Masipa says it is easy to see why these witnesses â€ “ Burger and Johnson â€ “ could be mistaken .
They were convinced a couple were being attacked but their distance from the Pistorius house made their interpretations of the noises they heard unreliable .
The judge says the testimony of neighbours Michelle Burger and Charl Johnson was â€œcorrectly in my viewâ€ � criticised by the defence for being unreliable , but she says they should not be criticised for the similarities in their police statements : that was down to the police officer who wrote them , she says .
Masipa says the neighbours were not dishonest but â€œgenuinely mistakenâ€ � in what they said they heard .
Masipa moves on to the disputed claims over the sounds of the gun firing and the cricket bat breaking down the door .
The defence claims that some of the sounds interpreted by neighbours as shots were in fact the bat .
The judge accepts this .
Did the police contaminate the scene or remove an extension cord from the bedroom after the shooting ?
Masipa says the court rightly spent time looking at this , but adds : These issues pale into significance when one has regard to the rest of the evidence .
Masipa moves on to whether there was any intention or premeditation in the shooting of Steenkamp .
She says it will serve no purpose to rehash the arguments on this .
But she says the court has considered all the evidence on this .
The judge moves on to â€œcommon cause factsâ€ � â€ “ those that are not disputed by state and defence .
She deals with count 1 ( the killing of Steenkamp ) only for now .
She says it is accepted that the accused , on his stumps , fired four shots at the toilet door ; that Steenkamp was inside the cubicle , which was locked from the inside and three of the shots hit her ; that she died from multiple gunshot wounds .
She says it is not disputed that the accused then called for help ; removed Steenkamp from the cubicle and carried her downstairs ; that he was â€œvery emotionalâ€ � and tried to resuscitate her .
Again , Masipa summarises evidence from state witness without making any ruling on whether she is inclined to accept the prosecution case that the neighbours heard screaming from Steenkamp , or a row between the couple .
We are hearing a precis of what each neighbour heard , and when they made calls to estate security .
The stateâ€ ™ s case was that Pistorius had deliberately shot and killed Steenkamp , Masipa says .
She begins to summarise the prosecution evidence , starting with testimony from neighbours .
Masipa :
The accused admitted that the gunshot wounds were inflicted by him .
So far Masipa has read a clear , but entirely objective , account .
We have had no indication of her findings , or whether she is minded to accept or dismiss Pistoriusâ€ ™ version of the events of 14 February 2013 .
Masipa turns to Pistoriusâ€ ™ version of events .
He said he believed there was an intruder in his bathroom who posed a threat to him and to Steenkamp .
Pistorius described the incident as â€œa tragic oneâ€ � , the judge says .
She recounts his evidence of the series of events that led to the shooting .
Masipa is still reading through the charges against Pistorius , including the alleged illegal possession of ammunition , which the athlete claims he was holding for his father .
Security has been especially tight around this verdict .
Only the judge and her two assessors â€ “ more about them here
â€
“ know which way the judge has ruled .
Reporters in court say even the usual clerks were not allowed to type up the ruling , and it was kept under lock and key until this moment .
Masipa reads out the details of the four charges against Pistorius â€ “
you can read them here .
Masipa says Pistorius can remain seated .
She begins by talking through the scene of the shooting : Pistoriusâ€ ™ home on the Silver Woods estate in Pretoria , on 13/14 February 2013 .
Judge Masipa arrives in the courtroom .
Her papers are on the desk in front of her .
Judge Masipa is on her way .
Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s family are in the court to hear her verdict on the man who shot her :
My colleague David Smith , who is in court in Pretoria , says the judgeâ€ ™ s reading of her verdict could run into Friday : Masipa will read a written judgment in full and announce her verdict only at the end .
She is expected to summarise the testimony of each of the 37 witnesses and make a finding on its credibility and applicability to the case .
She is also likely to make reference to case law and will consider the three lesser firearms charges against Pistorius .
The entire process will probably take at least a day .
It therefore seems likely that she will not make her verdict known until Friday .
Court is due to resume in the next few minutes .
As we await the verdict , some background reading that helps put the trial into context .
My colleague David Smith says the trial has been a mirror on South African society : South Africa itself has been on trial over the past six months .
The world has been told of police bungling and dishonesty but been given a rather more flattering picture of the judicial system .
It has tried to decide whether this is a case of domestic violence or fear of residential crime â€ “ twin demons that torment South Africa .
It has seen how much has changed in this country since the end of racial apartheid in 1994 , and how much has stayed the same .
For many , there was redemption in the way South Africa defied outsidersâ€ ™ expectations of a kangaroo court .
In the austere setting with its rules and rituals , prosecutor Gerrie Nel and defence counsel Barry Roux gave the 37 witnesses no quarter , not least Pistorius himself , whose celebrity and wealth meant nothing against Nelâ€ ™ s fierce onslaught .
But above all there was Masipa , a red - robed figure of quiet dignity and gravitas who kept both lawyers in check and strove for a fair trial .
And , he writes , the trial has shone light on the issue of violence against women : South Africa has one of the highest rates of intimate partner homicide in the world .
In 2009 it was estimated that a woman was killed by her husband or boyfriend every eight hours â€ “ more commonly than by strangers .
The extraordinary life of the woman who already knows Pistoriusâ€ ™ fate , Judge Thokozile Masipa , is also worth a read : Black female judges are still a rarity .
Even though the population is 80 % black , only 44 % of superior court judges are .
And out of the countryâ€ ™ s 239 judges , only 76 are women .
Masipa says she feels the bench has more credibility in its diversity , but it also comes with specific challenges .
â€œSometimes
itâ€ ™ s not that easy ; sometimes the woman comes before your court and sheâ€ ™ s saying to herself , â€˜Well , sheâ€ ™ s black , sheâ€ ™ s a woman , she must understand this.â€ ™
But you still have to look at what the law says.â€
�
And the Guardianâ€ ™ s video team has put together this summary of the trial :
If Masipa finds Pistorius guilty of premeditated murder â€ “ that is , he knowingly intended to kill Steenkamp , or deliberately decided to kill an intruder â€ “ he would face a mandatory life sentence .
It would be 25 years before he would even be considered for parole .
The judge will also consider whether he is guilty of murder without premeditation : an intent to kill , but with no planning , in the heat of the moment .
Sentencing for a guilty verdict here is at the judgeâ€ ™ s discretion .
There is also the possibility of a manslaughter , or culpable homicide , conviction , if the judge believes Pistoriusâ€ ™ claim that he did not mean to kill Steenkamp , but decides he acted recklessly or negligently in firing into the locked door .
Pistorius could be acquitted if the judge accepts his account that he genuinely feared for his life and thought he was acting in self - defence .
Alongside the charge of murder , Pistorius is accused of two counts of discharging firearms in public , and another of illegal possession of ammunition .
Discharging firearms in public , first count : The prosecution says he discharged a firearm at a restaurant in January 2013 .
Pistorius said his friend Darren Fresco had passed him the loaded gun and denies he pulled the trigger .
In closing arguments , defence counsel Barry Roux said Pistorius had made a mistake and should be found guilty of a lesser charge of negligently discharging the firearm .
Discharging firearms in public , second count : Pistorius is accused of firing a gun through a car sunroof while he was with Fresco and Pistoriusâ€ ™ then girlfriend Samantha Taylor in November 2012 .
The athlete says he became angry after a police officer inspected his gun when the car was stopped for speeding ; the gun was apparently lying on a car seat .
But he denies firing a gun .
Both Taylor and Fresco say he did .
Illegal possession of ammunition : Pistorius is charged with being in possession of .38 ammunition ; he does not have a licence for a gun that takes that ammunition , a permit to be in possession of it or a dealerâ€ ™ s licence .
Pistorius told the court the bullets belonged to his father and he had them for safe - keeping .
If found guilty , Pistorius could face five years in prison on each of the first two counts , and 15 years for the illegal possession of ammunition .
Pistorius has arrived at the court .
Friends of Reeva Steenkamp have been tweeting their support for her and her family :
Welcome to the Guardianâ€ ™ s live coverage as the high court in Pretoria prepares to reconvene to hear judgment handed down on Oscar Pistorius for four charges â€ “ most significantly , the charge that he murdered his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , at his home on the night of 14 February 2013 .
The athlete denies the charge , claiming he believed there was an intruder in his house .
Alongside the charge of murder , Pistorius is accused of two counts of discharging firearms in public , and another of illegal possession of ammunition .
Judge Thokozile Masipa will this morning begin to read her judgment .
It is not yet clear how long it will take or at what point she will announce her verdict on Pistoriusâ€ ™ guilt or innocence on the main charge .
This blog will have live coverage throughout .
South Africa does not have jury trials ; the verdict is entirely Masipaâ€ ™ s , though she has had the advice of two assessors who sat with her through the lengthy trial process .
You can read more about them and their role here .
Last month saw the prosecution and defence deliver their closing arguments ( or heads of arguments ) .
You can read a detailed summary of those here , and these are the links to the full written heads filed by the state and the defence .
In brief : The prosecution says Pistorius is guilty of murder .
Lead counsel for the state Gerrie Nel told the court that the accusedâ€ ™ s actions in fetching the gun and walking down the corridor towards the bathroom indicate premeditation .
Whether he believed the person behind the door was an intruder or knew it was Steenkamp , it was murder by dolus directus ( premeditated murder ) or dolus eventualis
( he must have known he was likely to kill the person by firing ) .
Nel told the judge : â€œThe accused intended to kill a human being .
He knew there was a human being in that toilet.â€
�
The prosecution contends that the pair were arguing .
A witness says she heard a row , another saw the bathroom light on and Steenkampâ€ ™ s stomach contents indicate she was awake and eating several hours after Pistorius said they had gone to sleep .
Witnesses also heard â€œinterminglingâ€ � screams of a man and a woman .
WhatsApp messages between the pair showed Steenkamp saying she was â€œscaredâ€ � of her boyfriend .
The defence insists Pistorius should be acquitted .
If the firing of the gun was purely reflexive , he lacked criminal capacity ; if there was a thought process , it was â€œputative private defenceâ€ � ( self - defence ) because he believed he was in danger
â€ “ that an intruder was coming out of the toilet .
He had no motive to kill Steenkamp .
He has always said he thought it was an intruder .
The defence says the stateâ€ ™ s version of events â€ “ in which the fatal shots were fired at 3.17am â€ “ can not be true .
The defence says noises heard at 3.17am were the thuds of the cricket bat as Pistorius broke down the toilet door .
The shots , it contends , were earlier , which means the screams heard before 3.17am were made by the accused , and not by Steenkamp , who was already fatally wounded .

After 41 dramatic court days spread over six months , and in the absence of a jury , Masipa will finally pass judgment on what happened at Pistorius 's luxury home in Pretoria , South Africa , just after 3 am on Valentine 's day last year .
There is no dispute that he fired four hollow - tipped bullets through a locked toilet door , killing Steenkamp , a model and law graduate , almost instantly .
The question is why .
The judge must weigh the prosecution 's assertion that he murdered her in rage after an argument against the defence 's case that he panicked after mistaking her for an intruder .
It has been one of the most sensational murder trials in recent years , often compared with that of American athlete and actor OJ Simpson .
Prosecutors described Pistorius as an egotistical liar , obsessed with guns , fast cars and beautiful women , who was not prepared to take responsibility for his actions .
The defence said there are "" two Oscars "" – a world - class athlete and a highly vulnerable individual with a serious disability who acted out of fear , not anger , when he fired the fatal shots .
Pistorius frequently sobbed , howled and vomited in court .
"" It is very traumatic , "" said Cassandra Fani , 24 , a former athlete who used to train with Pistorius and supported him in court .
"" You 're everyone 's number one hero and the next minute you 're everyone 's enemy .
Whether he comes out guilty or not guilty , his career is forever tainted .
Everyone will think he 's a murderer –
the media have put that out there .
"" Members of both Pistorius 's and Steenkamp 's families will be out in force on the front row of the public gallery .
But the start of the hearing on Thursday morning is likely to be something of an anticlimax for the eager global audience .
Masipa will read a written judgment in full and announce her verdict only at the end .
She is expected to summarise the testimony of each of the 37 witnesses and make a finding on its credibility and applicability to the case .
She is also likely to make reference to case law and will consider the three lesser firearms charges against Pistorius .
The entire process will probably take at least a day .
It therefore seems likely that she will not make her verdict known until Friday .
There are various possible verdicts available to the judge .
She could find Pistorius guilty of murder , then specify whether it was premeditated ( he intended and planned it ) , dolus directus ( it was his aim and object to kill the deceased ) or dolus eventualis ( he foresaw the possibility of killing but did so anyway ) .
Premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence whereas the other categories allow her wide discretion .
There is no death penalty .
A further option is culpable homicide ( manslaughter ) , meaning that Pistorius lacked intention but was negligent by the standards of a reasonable person .
Legal experts have debated whether there could be a distinction between a reasonable person and reasonable disabled person , since the defence made much of Pistorius 's lifelong feeling of vulnerability without his prosthetic limbs .
If Pistorius is convicted , he will have to reapply for bail since he will potentially be more of a flight risk .
There will then be an adjournment , probably for a few weeks , before further arguments and sentencing .
Pistorius would have the option to appeal so could potentially remain at liberty for months or even years .
A final possibility is that the 27-year - old , known as the "" Blade Runner "" , will be acquitted if the judge accepts that he genuinely feared for his life and thought he was acting in self - defence .
Depending on the three other charges against him , which include firing a gun in a restaurant , he could walk free and into a media maelstrom .
His family have spoken of their hopes that he will resurrect his sporting career in time for the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics in Rio .
But few analysts following the trial believe that the sprinter , the first amputee to compete on an Olympic track , will escape a custodial sentence .
"" I have little doubt he will be convicted on a charge of murder , "" said Johan Burger , a former police officer and now a senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies in Pretoria .
"" It may not be premeditated murder .
I 'm not convinced the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he knew it was Reeva Steenkamp in the toilet .
But it is murder .
He knew he would probably kill whoever was in there .
I think he will get a prison sentence of a number of years . ""
A source close to the prosecution admitted there are holes in its case but said the same is true of the defence , and Pistorius should be convicted on his own version alone .
Another legal observer commented : "" Oscar 's heart must have sunk when he heard judge Masipa would be running the trial .
She is a hanging judge .
She has been very tough on men who killed women in the past .
"" Pistorius 's family , however , have loyally defended his integrity and version of events since the beginning .
His uncle , Arnold Pistorius , insisted : "" He 's not a thief , he 's not a liar , he 's not a murderer . ""
He was scathing of the prosecution case : "" What 's the saying ?
You can fool some of the people some of the time but you ca n't fool all of the people all of the time . ""
While an acquittal would bring relief for Pistorius , there is unlikely to be any sense of joy .
Arnold added : "" His sentence has been harsh already .
Every cent gone .
He 's been punished tremendously .
He lost his girlfriend and he 's in mourning . """
2014-09-12,"The Olympic and Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius has been found guilty of culpable homicide for the fatal shooting of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp and bailed ahead of sentencing .
The guilty verdict on the manslaughter charge , a day after the judge Thokozile Masipa cleared him of murder , means Pistorius could receive anything from 15 years in prison to a suspended sentence , which would potentially allow the double amputee a chance to resurrect his sporting career .
The court will resume for sentencing on 13 October .
Masipa ordered Pistorius to stand as she delivered the guilty verdict .
He stood ramrod with his hands folded in front of him .
Steenkamp 's parents , Barry and June , and other family members sat sombrely on the front row of the public gallery .
After the verdict , Pistorius turned to his family while members of Steenkamp 's family comforted each other .
When the court adjourned , June could be seen shaking her head and Steenkamp 's close friend Gina Myers broke down and wept .
# Pistorius is hugged by uncle then rests his forehead against that of sister Aimee .
Sombre expressions , not celebratory .

September 12 , 2014 Masipa made it clear that that although the state did not have to prove a motive for murder , there was no evidence in front of the court to say that Pistorius wanted to kill Steenkamp .
But Masipa said Pistorius had acted negligently when he shot Steenkamp through a closed toilet door and was guilty of culpable homicide . ""
A reasonable person , with a similar disability , would have foreseen that the person behind the door would be killed , and the accused failed to take action to avoid this , "" she told the court .
Pistorius was granted bail at the close of the hearing ahead of sentencing .
He left the Pretoria high court escorted by police and bodyguards through a scrum of television cameras .

With no mandatory sentence for culpable homicide , Masipa - known for handing out stiff sentences - will have a great deal of discretion over the punishment .
South Africa 's prosecuting authority said on Friday it was "" disappointed "" with the verdict but defended its decision to pursue a murder charge . ""
The prosecutors held the view that there was sufficient evidence to secure a successful prosecution on the charges that were preferred against the accused , "" spokesperson Nathi Mncube said in a statement .
Asked if the Steenkamp family was disappointed by the outcome , their lawyer Dup de Bruyn said : "" There 's no comment at the moment . ""
The family would give interviews to media organisations after Friday 's hearing according to their present contractual arrangements , he added .
Arnold Pistorius , who has spoken for his nephew before , delivered a short Pistorius family statement before leaving the court .
Pistorius and his father , Henke , are estranged .
"" There are no victors in this .
We as a family remain deeply affected by the devastating tragedy
â€
¦
It wo n't bring Reeva back but our hearts still go out for her family and friends . ""
He said the family would make no further statement due to the ongoing legal proceedings but was grateful to the judge for clearing him of the murder charge as it had always believed his version of events .
Pistorius has said he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder when he shot four times through a locked bathroom door , killing her almost instantly .
He was also cleared on two unrelated firearms charges - of firing a firearm through a sunroof and of illegal possession of ammunition - but found guilty on a third of illegally discharging a firearm in a crowded restaurant in January 2013 , weeks before Steenkamp 's death ."
2014-09-12,"Oscar Pistorius will find out in six weeks ' time what punishment he will face after being found guilty of culpable homicide for the death of his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp .
Pistorius was also found guilty of discharging a firearm in a crowded restaurant months before the fatal shooting at his home in Pretoria .
He was acquitted of another firearms - related offence and a charge of illegal possession of ammunition .
Sentencing The court has adjourned until 13 October , when the defence and prosecution will make further arguments before sentencing .
Both sides could call witnesses to substantiate their arguments , and Pistorius himself could be called back to the stand .
The judge Thokozile Masipa will have pre - sentencing documents drawn up , for which various parties will be consulted , including probation and correctional supervision officers .
Masipa has wide discretion over the sentence .
Pistorius could face a fine , a suspended sentence , correctional supervision and community service or up to 15 years in prison .
The maximum jail sentence for culpable homicide is rarely exercised , and a term of two to seven years seems most likely should Masipa choose prison .
In this event , Pistorius would be entitled to seek parole after serving half of his sentence .
Should correctional supervision be seen as appropriate , a wide range of options would be available to Masipa , including community service , reporting to a police station at regular intervals and attending rehabilitation programmes .
Possible prison term Should he be sentenced to jail , Pistorius would most likely go to Pretoria central prison or Baviaanspoort prison , also in Pretoria .
Because of his high profile , he could be seen as a target for fellow inmates .
He would probably be given a single cell and be allowed to see his own medical personnel .
He would have to swap his strict training regime for 23 hours of incarceration like other prisoners , and instead of his high - protein , low - carb diet he would get oat porridge and black tea or coffee for breakfast , bread and vegetables for lunch and cooked maize and a piece of meat for dinner .
He would also have to give up his specially designed sports apparel and suits for an orange prison overall .
Civil claim With the criminal case out of the way
, Pistorius could face a civil claim from Steenkamp 's family for damages including loss of income , trauma and medical expenses .
Appeal
The prosecution could appeal against Masipa 's decision to clear Pistorius of murder .
They will probably consult with the director of public prosecutions , and will be under increased scrutiny with the Shrien Dewani case scheduled to get under way next month ."
2014-09-12,"What is a â€œnormal relationshipâ€
� ?
Excitingly , this long - mulled - over question has at last been resolved .
â€œNormal relationships are dynamic and unpredictable most of the time , and human beings are fickle , â€ �
Judge Thokozile Masipa said on Thursday , explaining why she was not convicting Oscar Pistorius of the murder of Reeva Steenkamp .
This dynamism , according to Masipa , is why Steenkamp professed herself in messages to Pistorius to be â€œscared of you sometimes and how u snap at me and of how you will react to meâ€ � .
( This message was prescient , seeing as , on 14 February 2013
, Pistorius was to pump her full of bullets . )
Steenkamp felt â€œattackedâ€
� , she wrote , by the person she â€œdeserved protection from.â€ �
This , according to the judge , is a normal relationship .
And thus , even though Pistorius killed Steenkamp , he did not murder her , according to the judge .
Instead , she convicted him of culpable homicide .
I have been in relationships .
Some of them were dynamic and some unpredictable .
Never once , thank heavens , have I been â€œscaredâ€ � of my partner , let alone felt the need to tell him that .
Being scared of someone is not normal .
Pistorius , however , has a different approach to relationships .
An ex - girlfriend gave an interview yesterday describing how she would get so
â€œscaredâ€ � of him she â€œhid his gun.â€ �
Judge Masipa is an extraordinary person .
Indeed , part of the fascination in this case comes from the stories behind the two main players : Pistorius and Masipa .
As my colleague David Smith wrote this week , the court provided a fascinating microcosm of how much South Africa has changed in the past few decades , with a black Zulu judge deciding the fate of a wealthy white Afrikaner .
Pistorius 's tale is , of course , well known .
Masipa 's is not .
Sixty - six years old , she is the second black woman in South Africa to attain the position of judge , and she did so by going to night school for 10 years while holding down a day job and raising two children .
She is no pushover when it comes to the abuse of women .
She once sentenced a former prison officer to life imprisonment after he shot and killed his wife in an argument .
â€œYou are not a protector , â€ � Masipa said .
â€œYou are a killer.â€ �
The Steenkamps will doubtless feel frustration that the judge did not think the same about Pistorius , the man who Steenkamp wanted , to use her ambiguous phrase , â€œprotection fromâ€ � .
As an athlete , Pistorius argued passionately that a person 's backstory should not determine the public 's reaction to them â€ “ their achievements should be judged on merit
( he thought better of this during his trial , when his â€œvulnerabilityâ€ � was repeatedly cited as a mitigating factor for killing Steenkamp ) .
So admiration for Masipa should not stop us from asking questions .
Questions such as , how can a man pump four bullets into a bathroom door and be acquitted of intention to kill ?
And how can a judge as smart as Masipa think that Pistorius 's immediate horror at what he 'd done is proof that he did n't mean to kill , if not Steenkamp then at least somebody ?
These are some of the factors that convinced the judge not to convict him of premeditated murder ( which was never going to happen anyway ) or , much more surprisingly , dolus eventualis , a lesser charge of murder .
We know what it takes for people to believe that a woman has been abused by a famous , powerful man : they need to witness the actual abuse .
The NFL only accepted that American footballer Ray Rice had done a Really Bad Thing when the video of him slugging his then fiancee Janay Palmer unconscious in an elevator was leaked this week .
The earlier video of him dragging her unconscious out of the lift was , apparently , not good enough : the NFL had to see the punch because previously they 'd apparently thought he knocked her out with a kiss .
Rice , like Pistorius , was simply too lucrative for the sporting industry to lose just because of a pesky domestic - abuse charge .
Within minutes of Masipa wrapping up her verdict , South Africa 's Paralympic committee issued a statement that â€œif Pistorius wishes to resume his athletics career then we wouldnâ€ ™ t step in his wayâ€ � .
What 's a little culpable homicide between colleagues ?
Glen Poole wrote on the Guardian 's Comment is free yesterday that the reason female - on - male domestic violence is not taken seriously is because of â€œa binary narrative that maintains our unconscious , collective belief that men are problems and women have problems.â€ � Female - on - male domestic abuse is a terrible problem for those who suffer from it , but the reason it is not acknowledged as much is because women , by and very large , can not cause as much physical damage as men .
Emotional damage , yes , but not physical .
A woman who is killed is most likely to be killed by a man ; a man who is killed is most likely to be killed by a man .
The abuse of Janay Rice and the death of Reeva Steenkamp â€ “ and of Nicole Brown Simpson , while we 're talking about brutalised partners of celebrity athletes
â€ “ remind us , were reminders needed , that men can cause unimaginable physical damage to the women they say they love .
As a Johannesburg - based attorney told the Guardian yesterday , Masipa 's ruling sends out â€œa very negative message that you can kill someone and claim it was a mistake and get away with itâ€ � .
And this is an issue that , of course , goes far beyond celebrity .
In South Africa , a woman is killed by her partner every eight hours .
In the UK , two die a week .
Perhaps Masipa was right after all .
Perhaps this was a â€œnormal relationship.â€ �
But that does n't make it right ."
2014-09-12,"Oscar Pistorius surrendered to emotion and let tears stream down his face on Thursday as a judge effectively cleared him of the murder of his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp .
Judge Thokozile Masipa did , however , appear to suggest Pistorius was guilty of manslaughter , known in South Africa as culpable homicide , by saying it was clear he had "" acted unlawfully "" in opening fire at his home on Valentine 's Day last year .
If the culpable homicide verdict is confirmed â€ “ left as a possibility after the judge , just after lunch , abruptly adjourned the reading of her verdicts until Friday â€ “ Pistorius could receive anything from 15 years in prison to a suspended sentence , which would potentially allow the double amputee athlete , known as the Blade Runner , a chance to resurrect his sporting career .
After six months of fierce debate in court and beyond , Masipa accepted the paralympian 's explanation that he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder when he shot four times through a locked bathroom door , killing her almost instantly .
Pistorius sat in the dock and sobbed quietly as the judge ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove he was guilty of murder and the evidence was "" purely circumstantial "" .
Pistorius being cleared of murder , in a trial that has riveted millions , surprised some in South African legal circles , and there were claims that Masipa had misinterpreted the law and sent a dangerous message .
Those inside the courtroom witnessed wildly swinging emotions and palpable tension .
The Pistorius trial had become something of a television and Twitter soap opera in his home country and around the world .
Now , after 41 days in court and thousands of pages of evidence , it was the turn of Masipa , only the second black female judge appointed to the high court , to take centre stage .
She entered just after 9.30am , walking slowly , bowing her head and taking her seat on the dais .
She looked out at the now familiar wood - panelled courtroom : prosecutor Gerrie Nel to her left , defence counsel Barry Roux to her right , the teams of lawyers , Pistorius 's brother Carl in a wheelchair after a car accident , Pistorius himself looking anxious in the dock , then his father and uncle and Steenkamp 's parents on the front row and , beyond , journalists and onlookers .
There was silence in courtroom save for the hum of an air conditioner , the flurry of fingers on laptops and the odd cough .
Those in the room , and listening around the world , hung on every word .
Masipa effectively dismissed entire days ' evidence with a stroke of her pen .
Nel , who had become a minor celebrity , dubbed the "" pitbull "" for his aggressive style , saw large parts of his case demolished .
Among them were intimate WhatsApp messages between Pistorius and Steenkamp , a model and law graduate , which dominated headlines but were deemed irrelevant .
Nel had gone to great pains to highlight messages that suggested acrimony , whereas the defence pointed to messages showing mutual affection .
Masipa said they "" prove nothing "" , adding : "" Normal relationships are dynamic and unpredictable most of the time , while human beings are fickle .
Neither the evidence of the loving relationship or a relationship turned sour can assist this court to determine whether the accused had the requisite intention to kill the deceased . ""
Neighbours who claimed they heard a woman screaming were similarly found to be "" fallible "" and unreliable .
"" Most witnesses had their facts wrong , "" she said .
"" I am of the view that they failed to separate what they knew personally or what they heard from other people or what they gathered from the media . ""
The judge dismissed these conflicting accounts and said the court had the advantage of technology : the record of phone calls that night .
The timeline these established "" tipped the balance "" in favour of Pistorius 's version of events , she said .
She was , however , damning in her assessment of Pistorius 's testimony under cross - examination by Nel . ""
The accused was a very poor witness , "" she said .
"" The accused was , amongst other things , an evasive witness .
He failed to listen properly to questions put to him under cross - examination , giving the impression that he was more worried by the impact his answers might cause rather than the questions asked . ""
Yet she observed that untruthfulness did not in itself mean the accused was guilty .
She went on : "" Viewed in its totality , the evidence failed to establish that the accused had the requisite intention to kill the deceased , let alone with premeditation .
The state clearly has not proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of premeditated murder .
There are just not enough facts to support such a finding . ""
Masipa dismissed claims that Pistorius shot because of a reflex action . ""
He took a conscious decision , he knew where he kept his firearm and he knew where his bathroom was .
This is inconsistent with lack of criminal capacity .
The intention to shoot , however , does not necessarily include the intention to kill . ""
Perhaps most controversially , Masipa ruled that Pistorius could not foresee that he would kill the person behind the door when he shot four times .
Therefore he could not be found guilty of a lesser charge of murder .
"" How could the accused reasonably have foreseen that the shots he fired would kill the deceased ? ""
she asked . ""
Clearly he did not subjectively foresee this as a possibility , that he would kill the person behind the door , let alone the deceased , as he thought she was in the bedroom at the time . ""
At the end of the morning session , Pistorius sat silently for long minutes , engulfed in emotion , comforted by Carl and his sister , Aimee .
The ruling represented a victory for Roux , who had argued that the 27-year - old should have been tried for culpable homicide rather than murder because he had displayed an exaggerated "" startle response "" aggravated by his lifelong "" disability and consequent vulnerability "" .
Pistorius 's lower legs were amputated when he was 11 months old .
It will also bring some relief to his family , who were in court to support him every day , and the legion of fans who believed in him .
It even raises the prospect that the Paralympian could one day return to the track .
But the judgment is likely to be condemned by friends and supporters of Steenkamp , including the African National Congress women 's league , which was regularly represented in the public gallery .
It will also fuel fears that Pistorius has received preferential treatment because of his wealth and fame .
Martin Hood , a Johannesburg - based attorney specialising in criminal firearms offences , said : "" I 'm disappointed and shocked .
I think the judge has made some incorrect factual findings and applied the wrong legal tests .
She should have found legal intent and found him guilty of murder .
She 's got it mixed up , unfortunately . ""
Hood claimed that every lawyer he had spoken to was in agreement .
He added : "" It sends out a very negative message that you can kill somebody , claim it was a mistake and get away with it .
That not what we want in this country .
We want to be hard on crime and intimate violence .
It has created an extremely negative perception of the justice system . ""
Professor Rachel Jewkes , director of gender and health research unit at the South African Medical Research Council , blamed the law rather than the judge .
"" I think it is incredibly disappointing for women that the legal system is set up in a way that makes it extremely difficult to prove premeditated murder when there are n't other witnesses that could provide information .
It 's difficult to say a judge is wrong when she has to work within the parameters of the law .
We 're looking at a case where commonsense justice has not been done for Reeva and her family .
The law does n't always deliver what ordinary people call justice and that 's clearly the case here . ""
Dean Peacock , executive director of Sonke Gender Justice , a group that campaigns against rape and domestic violence , said : "" We respect the judge 's decision and wo n't second guess it .
In a country where the criminal justice system routinely fails gender - based violence victims , the verdict will easily be interpreted as evidence that violence against women goes unpunished .
That 's not Masipa 's fault .
That 's the fault of an endemic failure to hold perpetrators of domestic violence and rape accountable .
"" Some observers felt the judge contradicted herself when , in finding Pistorius negligent , she said : "" A reasonable person would have foreseen if he fired shots at the door , the person inside the toilet might be struck and might die as a result . ""
This , according to critics , should constitute murder rather than culpable homicide .
Nevertheless , Pistorius returned to his uncle 's home on Thursday night with a possible jail term still hanging over him .
Masipa said a "" reasonable person "" would not have fired four shots into the toilet cubicle , and that Pistorius acted "" too hastily and used excessive forceâ€š In the circumstances , it is clear his conduct was negligent . ""
With a culpable homicide conviction seemingly imminent , she then abruptly ended the day 's proceedings in what many observers described as a "" cliffhanger "" .
Verdicts on this and three other firearms - related charges are expected on Friday , with sentencing to come some weeks later .
Pistorius sat with his sister and aunt for a while then left the courtroom , declining to speak to journalists , passing through a melee of cameras and camera phones to what may be another night of unquiet sleep ."
2014-09-12,"In the immediate wake of the culpable homicide verdict , South African lawyers have questioned whether the judge in the Oscar Pistorius case erred in clearing the Olympic athlete of murder .
As state prosecutors announced they were considering appealing judge Thokozile Masipa 's decision , legal experts suggested she may have focused too closely on the relationship between Reeva Steenkamp and Pistorius .
Had there been an intruder behind the toilet door , as Pistorius told the court he believed , then firing four shots into such a confined space would probably have been considered murder by other courts , some lawyers argued .
Emma Sadleir , an expert on social media law who has been monitoring responses to the verdict , told the Guardian that many South African lawyers were uneasy with the decision on common law murder â€ “ what is known in the country 's laws as dolus eventualis murder . ""
The legal fraternity are concerned that the test for dolus eventualis may been applied incorrectly , "" Sadleir said .
"" The judge seems to have concentrated on the question of whether it was Reeva . ""
But even if he thought there was an intruder behind the door , lawyers are saying , it would still mean that the action was murder .
There 's a lot of chatter that this is a highly unusual case in which the prosecution will appeal on a point of law under section 310 of the criminal procedure act . ""
Sadleir said legal opinion supported the judge 's reasoning that there was insufficient evidence of the couple having had a row or fallen out with one another and therefore no evidence of premeditated murder .
But , she added : "" Even according to Pistorius ' version there was a person behind the door .
It was a tiny cubicle , less than 1.5 by 1.5 metres , to have fired into . ""
Sadleir said there was precedence in a recent case where a South African rapper , Jub Jub was found guilty of murder after racing a Mini Cooper through the streets of Soweto and ploughing into a crowd of schoolchildren , killing four of them . ""
The judge in that case said that he should have foreseen the possibility of the deaths and returned a verdict of murder . ""
In the Pistorius case , she said , the likelihood of death resulting from opening fire in such a confined space was far greater .
Dr David Klatzow , a leading South African forensic scientist , also believed the judge had not got it right .
"" It was irrelevant whether it was Reeva or anybody else behind that door , "" he explained .
"" There is a provision in South African law that [ self - defence ] force must be proportional to the threat and reasonable . ""
If I shot someone who is punching my wife that would be unreasonable .
Your life and that of anyone else has to be in immediate , mortal danger .
I 'm not sure that it was ever shown [ that he was ] in immediate mortal danger .
[ Such a claim ] could be measured against his veracity in the witness box , which did him no favours .
"" Everyone here owns a firearm and they have to undergo a written examination in which this is one of the issues .
Anybody who fires a 9 mm pistol will know about the lethal nature of those bullets .
I 'm surprised the judge found him not guilty of murder . """
2014-09-12,"Last Valentineâ€ ™ s Day , Oscar Pistorius killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp after firing four times through a locked bathroom door in the middle of the night .
He thought Steenkamp was still in bed next to him .
He thought she was an intruder , he said , offering up the flimsiest of defences for the indefensible .
It was as if Pistorius knew he didnâ€ ™ t need to come up with a plausible explanation
and so he did not even try .
Since the trial began in March , weâ€ ™ ve watched and waited and hoped for justice .
It has been a bit surreal , given the facts of the case , to imagine an outcome where justice would not be served .
Or it has been a bit surreal to accept that we live in a world where a man can justify shooting an unarmed woman through a locked door .
Then again , this is also a world where an armed police officer can shoot an unarmed young black man .
Whether in South Africa or Ferguson , Missouri , the rules most of us live by hardly seem to apply to white men .
Today , we have a clearer understanding of what justice means for certain groups of people , which is to say that justice can mean far too little .
Judge Thokozile Matilda Masipa has found Pistorius guilty of culpable homicide rather than premeditated murder .
Hers is a verdict that raises the question â€ “ what does a man have to do to be found guilty of murdering a woman ?
Among her comments , Judge Masipa , who has acquitted herself well throughout the trial , noted that Pistoriusâ€ ™ s defence of his crime can â€œreasonably possibly be trueâ€ � .
The evidence against Pistorius for premeditated murder was â€œpurely circumstantialâ€ � .
He did , however , act negligently because â€œa reasonable person with a similar disability would have foreseen that the person behind the door would be killed , and the accused failed to take action to avoid thisâ€ � .
Those words are hollow because a reasonable person never would have been in such a situation in the first place .
We might be able to say that this is a failure of prosecution , that the prosecutors did not do enough to prove that Pistorius committed premeditated murder .
Those words feel flimsy right now .
A woman is dead at the hands of her intimate partner .
She is dead under the most implausible of circumstances because what would an intruder be doing , locked in a bathroom in the middle of the night ?
We know , because of details that emerged after she was killed , that Steenkamp and Pistorius had volatile moments in their relationship .
We know Pistorius had a penchant for modern weaponry .
We know a woman is dead , and still what we know is not enough .
Among the other counts Judge Masipa adjudicated , Pistorius was convicted of the negligent handling of a firearm after he misfired a gun in a restaurant last year .
One can not help but feel that interrupting a meal and interrupting a womanâ€ ™ s life are offences held in somewhat equal regard in this world .
Now we will have to wait until 13 October for sentencing to find out what the judge sees as a fitting punishment for this lesser crime .
That punishment , too , will not be enough .
What makes this all the more offensive is how Pistorius has , essentially , framed his defence as a fear of blackness .
By evoking an unseen intruder he has exploited the complex and fraught racial history of South Africa to help justify his crime .
As Margie Orford wrote , in these pages , â€œThis imaginary body of the paranoid imaginings of suburban South Africa has lurked like a bogeyman at the periphery of this story for the past year .
It is the threatening body , nameless and faceless , of an armed and dangerous black intruder.â€
�
Pistorius would have us believe that he thought his girlfriend was safely in bed next to him .
He would have us believe this mythical black intruder was locked in his bathroom .
He would have us believe this mythical black intruder was whom he was killing when he fired through a closed door four times , as if somehow that would be justifiable .
Though early this morning I may not understand this world we live in , Oscar Pistorius understands it and what he can get away with , perfectly .

Masipa found Pistorius not guilty of two further firearms charges : that he fired a gun through a car sunroof , and that he was in possession of illegal ammunition .
But he was found guilty of negligently discharging a loaded gun in a crowded restaurant just weeks before he shot Steenkamp .
In a statement made in court after the verdicts , Arnold Pistorius , the athleteâ€ ™ s uncle , said the judgment had lifted â€œa big burdenâ€ � from the family , but insisted there were â€œno victors â€ ¦ in this devastating tragedyâ€ � .
Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents , June and Barry , left the court after the verdicts were handed down and have so far made no public comment .
A conviction for culpable homicide carries a maximum jail term of 15 years .
But any sentence is at the discretion of the judge and possible options also include non - custodial punishments .
The firearms offence can attract a sentence of up to five years in prison .
The International Paralympic Committee has said Pistorius would be allowed to compete in future sporting events : Oscarâ€ ™ s done a great deal for the Paralympic movement , heâ€ ™ s been an inspiration to millions , but obviously his priority now is to see [ what ] the judge decides .
And then if he wishes to resume his athletics career then we wouldnâ€ ™ t step in his way , we would allow him to compete again in the future .
The National Prosecuting Authority has said it is â€œdisappointedâ€
� by the verdicts
â€ “
it is still possible that the state could appeal : We respect the court decision to convict the accused on culpable homicide , which is in fact a serious crime .
We are , however , disappointed that we were not successful in securing a conviction on the original charge of premeditated murder .
NPA will await until the matter is concluded and will then comment on any further legal steps that might be envisaged .
Over the next few weeks , both sides will prepare pre - sentencing reports .
It is possible that the Steenkamp family might be asked to make submissions to the court .
Until 13 October , Pistorius remains free on bail .
Thatâ€ ™ s it for the live blog today .
Thank you for reading .
Chaotic scenes outside the court as Oscar Pistorius left the building .
He will return to the home of his uncle and aunt , Arnold and Lois Pistorius , ahead of sentencing on 13 October , when he will find out if he is to receive a custodial sentence .
Arnold and Lois Pistorius , uncle and aunt of the athlete , plus his media spokeswoman Anneliese Burgess are in the courtroom .
Arnold Pistorius reads the statement .
He says they are grateful to the judge for clearing Pistorius of murder , which lifts a burden for them .
He says the family has always believed his version .
There are no victors in this .
We as a family remain deeply affected by the devastating tragedy
â€
¦
It wonâ€
™ t bring Reeva back but our hearts still go out for her family and friends .
He says they will not make a further statement or take questions from reporters due to ongoing legal proceedings â€ “ the sentencing .
Nathi Mncube , spokesperson for the National Prosecuting Authority , has put out this statement on Twitter , defending the actions of the state in pursuing the murder charge : The National Prosecuting Authority of South Africa respects the findings of the court today .
However , from the beginning the prosecutors held the view that there was sufficient evidence to secure a successful prosecution on the charges that were preferred against the accused .
We respect the court decision to convict the accused on culpable homicide , which is in fact a serious crime .
We are , however , disappointed that we were not successful in securing a conviction on the original charge of premeditated murder .
NPA will await until the matter is concluded and will then comment on any further legal steps that might be envisaged .
Further , NPA is satisfied with the manner in which the prosecution team prosecuted the case .
They displayed the highest degree of professionalism and their ethical conduct could not be faulted throughout the trial .
They have served as good ambassadors for the National Prosecuting Authority of South Africa and the fight for justice .
Oscar Pistorius has now left the courtroom .
His uncle Arnold Pistorius will make a statement on behalf of the family in about 20 minutesâ€ ™ time .
Iâ€ ™ ll cover it here .
My colleague David Smith , who is in Pretoria , sends this reaction from the Steenkamp family : Asked if the family was disappointed by the outcome , their lawyer Dup de Bruyn said : â€œThereâ€ ™ s no comment at the moment.â€ � The Steenkamps would give interviews to media organisations after Fridayâ€ ™ s hearing according to their present contractual arrangements , he added .
Reporters in court in Pretoria say the Pistorius family is expected to make a statement in around half an hour .
Masipa asks Roux to talk to Arnold Pistorius ( â€œthe person looking after himâ€ � ) to make sure there are â€œno further complicationsâ€
� when the court resumes for sentencing on 13 October .
The court rises .
Proceedings today are finished .
We move on to sentencing dates .
Barry Roux asks for it to take place between 13 and 16 October .
Gerrie Nel says he is available then .
Masipa agrees to adjourn until 13 October .
Masipa says she has not been persuaded by the stateâ€ ™ s argument .
She will extend bail .
Masipa says the onus is on the state to persuade her it is not in the interests of justice to extend bail .
She says she accepts the defence claim that he sold his home to pay his legal costs .
Masipa begins by summarising the objections of the state to the bail application : Pistorius has now been convicted of â€œa very serious offenceâ€ � .
He has , during the course of the trial , sold three properties and now owns no property in South Africa .
During the course of the trial , Pistorius was involved in an â€œincidentâ€ � in a nightclub .
His family made a statement to the press admitting he was â€œself - harmingâ€ � .
The mental health evaluation deemed him a potential suicide risk .
The judge is back to give her ruling on the bail application .
South Africaâ€ ™ s
National Prosecuting Authority has said it is â€œdisappointedâ€
� by the failure to convict Pistorius of the more serious charge of murder .
Speaking outside the court , Nathi Mncube , spokesperson for the NPA , said : We respect the judgment that has been delivered .
We believed in this instance there was enough evidence to secure a conviction under pre - meditated murder .
Of course we are disappointed .
We are disappointed we did not secure a conviction under premeditated murder and also there was acquittal on the other two [ firearms ] charges .
The matter has not been concluded yet , we are still waiting for a sentence to be imposed .
He said it was too early to decide whether prosecutors would launch an appeal .
The judge is running late again .
Pistorius is back in the courtroom , having spent some time in the holding cells .
Reporters in court say that lawyers for both sides have been called to the judgeâ€ ™ s chambers .
June Steenkamp , Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s mother , has not returned to court .
Pistorius would be allowed to compete in future sporting events , the International Paralympic Committee has said .
The Press Association files this report : The International Paralympic Committee will allow Oscar Pistorius to compete in the future after the movementâ€ ™ s most famous athlete was found guilty of the culpable homicide of his girlfriend .
Pistorius will be sentenced at a later date but the IPC said they would allow him to return to the sport .
Craig Spence , the IPCâ€ ™ s director of media and communications , told BBC Radio 5 Live : â€œOscarâ€ ™ s done a great deal for the Paralympic movement , heâ€ ™ s been an inspiration to millions , but obviously his priority now is to see [ what ] the judge decides .
And then if he wishes to resume his athletics career then we wouldnâ€ ™ t step in his way , we would allow him to compete again in the future.â€ �
The IPCâ€ ™ s chief executive Xavier Gonzalez said Pistorius had been a â€œfundamental ambassadorâ€ � for the movement in the run - up to the London 2012 Olympics but that the trial had not had a negative impact on the Paralympic sport .
Gonzalez said : â€œSince it started more than two years ago , this trial has not had any impact on our activities .
We have been very clear in differentiating our work from what was happening in the life of one individual .
â€œThat will not change with the verdict today .
The trial has not had any negative impact on the Paralympic movement .
Since London with Sochi in 2014 we have seen an incredible growth in all aspects of our activities and we look forward very positively to Rio and Pyeong Chang .
â€œOscar was a fundamental ambassador of the Paralympic movement in the period between 2008 and 2012 .
Since then the Paralympic movement has many other ambassadors and many other athletes that have been recognised globally
and we believe that will continue growing as we lead up to 2016.â€ � Pistorius is back in the courtroom , having spent part of this adjournment in the holding cells : The court has paused for the judge to consider whether to allow Pistorius to stay on bail .
He has been on bail , living at the home of his uncle , Arnold Pistorius , for 18 months .
The defence says he has complied with all bail conditions so far and there is no reason to revoke the bail now he has been convicted of culpable homicide and a separate firearms charge .
The state opposes bail .
It says Pistorius poses a greater flight risk because he has now been convicted of a serious offence .
He has sold his property ( the defence says this was to pay legal fees ) and so does not have financial ties to South Africa .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said an incident in which Pistorius was thrown out of a nightclub in July and a mental health report that concluded he was at risk of suicide are both indications that bail should be revoked .
Judge Masipa should be giving her ruling at 12.30pm South African time ( 11.30BST ) .
The Guardian video team has put together this short film of the judge handing down her verdicts :
And David Smith has also written more about Reeva Steenkamp .
For much of the trial , she has been referred to as â€œPistoriusâ€ ™ girlfriendâ€ � or â€œthe deceasedâ€ � .
Reeva Steenkamp was born in Cape Town on 19 August 1983 , and moved to the city of Port Elizabeth as a child .
She graduated with a law degree from the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University but was spotted by a talent scout and launched a career in modelling .
She publicly denounced violence against women , and on the day she died she was due to give an inspirational talk at a school in Johannesburg .
Kerry Smith knew Reeva for four years at university when they were law students and , after drifting apart , they renewed their friendship via Facebook .
She still becomes emotional when she hears their favourite songs â€ “ BeyoncÃ
© â€ ™ s Me , Myself and I and OutKastâ€ ™ s
Hey Ya !
â€ “ on the radio .
â€œWe loved BeyoncÃ © .
We used to call her Bouncy .
When I hear the songs , itâ€ ™ s not a sullen emotion that comes over me .
Itâ€ ™ s sad but itâ€ ™ s happy - sad .
I remember the good things.â€

My colleague David Smith has filed this report on the effects of the long and often trial on the Steenkamp family â€ “ in particular , her parents , June and Barry : June , 67 , attended almost every day of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s trial , while her husband Barry , 71 , who recently suffered a stroke , followed it on TV and joined her for the first time for closing arguments last month .
The rest of the world has been watching , debating and tweeting the case , but for the Steenkamps it has meant constantly reliving the night of their 29-year - old daughterâ€ ™ s death .
â€œIt doesnâ€ ™ t go away , â€ � said Barryâ€ ™ s brother Mike Steenkamp .
â€œThe experience is a daily occurrence .
Itâ€ ™ s not something you sweep under the carpet and itâ€ ™ s gone .
Itâ€ ™ s up in your face all the time .
As it goes on , flashes of Reeva keep coming back.â€ �
The International Paralympic Committee ( IPC ) has put out a statement following the conviction of Pistorius : Following todayâ€ ™ s verdict , our thoughts remain with all those who have been affected by this terrible tragedy , in particular the family and friends of Reeva Steenkamp , who sadly lost her life in this incident .
Throughout this case , the IPC has stressed the importance of differentiating between Oscarâ€ ™ s contribution to the Paralympic Movement and his private life .
As a sports organisation , it would be unwise for the IPC to comment on the conclusion of a court case that is not related to sport .
The athleteâ€ ™ s bail has been revoked until the judge returns with her decision .
He is taken down to the cells at the courtroom by a group of five police officers .
He is not handcuffed .
Lawyer Brian Webber says it is just for the duration of the break .
There is likely to be some disquiet about the reading out in court â€ “ and to the worldwide television audience â€ “ of Arnold Pistoriusâ€ ™ full address , where Oscar Pistorius is currently living :
Masipa adjourns the court to consider the bail decision .
The judge asks Nel whether there is dispute over why Pistorius sold his home .
Nel says he doesnâ€ ™ t have any evidence but he can draw an inference that he sold it so he did not have to stay in South Africa .
Roux is on his feet again .
He says the original bail granted was for a more serious allegation
â€ “ premeditated murder â€ “ than the eventual conviction .
He complied with all bail conditions .
He says Pistorius accepts he can not go to public places such as the nightclub .
That was a mistake .
He adds that Pistorius sold his property out of need â€ “ he had to pay for his legal costs .
He is not planning to flee the country .
Roux says there is no basis to think Pistorius would kill himself ahead of sentencing .
Nel says it is not in the interests of justice to allow someone convicted of negligent killing to be released on bail .
Nel says that since bail was initially granted , Pistorius has sold his house .
He does not have a property now , and lives with family .
While on bail , he was involved in an incident at a nightclub , in which he was thrown out of the club .
( You can read details of that incident here . )
Nel refers to the press release put out by Pistoriusâ€ ™ family after that , which refers to his â€œself - harming behaviourâ€ � .
Nel says the report from the mental health evaluation that said Pistorius was a suicide risk .
Gerrie Nel , lead prosecutor , speaks now .
He wants to put â€œcertain factorsâ€ � before the court .
He says this is a serious conviction , â€œhe caused the death of an innocent womanâ€ � .
â€œLengthy imprisonmentâ€ � is probable , he says .
Pistorius knows for a fact he has been convicted .
Before , on bail , he thought he might be acquitted .
Roux says Pistorius has complied with all his bail conditions and there is no reason to revoke it .
He says detaining Pistorius would make it very difficult for the defence team to prepare its submissions for sentencing .
Roux says it is â€œprematureâ€ � to consider a likely sentence .
He says the onus is on the state to argue why Pistorius should not get bail .
The judge has returned after a lengthier break than anticipated .
Barry Roux , lead counsel for the defence , speaks .
He says Pistoriusâ€ ™ bail should be valid until sentence is imposed , despite the conviction .
The Pistorius family has indicated to reporters in the courtroom that they will make a statement at some point .
It is likely to be made by Arnold Pistorius , who has spoken for his nephew before .
The five - minute break has gone on rather longer â€ “ Gerrie Nel and Barry Roux have been called to the judgeâ€ ™ s chambers .
It is possible that decisions are being made about dates for sentencing .
We could also hear a fresh application for bail today .
Some more information on sentencing â€ “ which might not come for a few more weeks : Reporters in the courtroom say that Barry Steenkamp , Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s father , has left .
June Steenkamp , her mother , is talking with members of the ANC Womenâ€ ™ s League , who have supported her throughout the trial .
Oscar Pistorius is talking quietly with his uncle , Arnold Pistorius , and his lawyers .
Henke Pistorius , his father , from whom â€ “ he told the court â€ “
he is estranged , is present but has not approached his son .
My colleague David Smith , who is in court in Pretoria , has filed this report : The Olympic and Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius has been found guilty of culpable homicide for the fatal shooting of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp .
The guilty verdict on the manslaughter charge , a day after the judge Thokozile Masipa cleared him of murder , means Pistorius could receive anything from 15 years in prison to a suspended sentence , which would potentially allow the double amputee a chance to resurrect his sporting career .
The court will resume for sentencing at a later date .
Masipa said on the first day of delivering her verdict that it was clear Pistorius acted unlawfully in opening fire at his home , but she cleared him of the murder charges , for which she said the evidence was â€œpurely circumstantialâ€ � .
Masipa said a â€œreasonable personâ€ � would not have fired four shots into the toilet cubicle , and that Pistorius acted â€œtoo hastily and used excessive force .
In the circumstances , it is clear his conduct was
negligent.â€ � Pistorius has said he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder when he shot four times through a locked bathroom door , killing her almost instantly .
He was cleared of firing a firearm through a sunroof and of illegal possession of ammunition , but found guilty of illegally discharging a firearm in a crowded restaurant in January 2013 , weeks before Steenkampâ€ ™ s death .
The maximum prison sentence for culpable homicide is 15 years , but there is no minimum term and the sentence is at the discretion of the judge .
The second count on which he has been found guilty â€ “ discharging a firearm in a public place â€ “ carries a maximum jail term of five years .
Both state and defence would be expected to make submissions to the judge ahead of her decision on sentencing , which will not be today .
A reminder â€ “ we will probably not see sentencing today .
Given the two convictions , it is likely that Pistorius will have to reapply for bail ( which could happen today ) , since he will potentially be more of a flight risk .
There will then be an adjournment , probably for a few weeks , before further arguments and sentencing .
Pistorius also has the option to appeal the convictions , so could potentially remain at liberty for months while that process takes place .
The implications of the verdict are sinking in for those in the courtroom : Judge Masipa takes a five - minute break to see counsel in chambers .
On the issue of indemnity for Fresco for the restaurant incident , Masipa allows him indemnity from prosecution .
In closing arguments , Barry Roux , lead counsel for the defence , said the starting point for this trial should have been a charge of culpable homicide , rather than murder .
Masipa made it clear that , although the state did not have to prove a motive for murder , there was no evidence in front of the court to say that Pistorius wanted to kill Steenkamp .
But her interpretation that a reasonable person would have foreseen that shooting four times through the door would kill the person behind it â€ “ but to clear Pistorius because he did not foresee this â€ “ is likely to spark much debate and criticism .
Some observations from reporters in court in Pretoria as Pistorius was found not guilty of murder , but guilty of the culpable homicide â€ “ manslaughter â€ “ of Reeva Steenkamp : The court moves straight on to address the question of whether witness Darren Fresco should receive indemnity from prosecution for the evidence he gave .
Masipa earlier called him â€œdishonestâ€ � .
Count 2 : the sunroof incident â€ “ not guilty .
Count 3 : the restaurant shooting â€ “ guilty .
Count 4 : illegal possession of ammunition â€ “ not guilty .
Judge asks Pistorius to stand .
Not guilty of murder of Reeva Steenkamp .
Guilty of culpable homicide .
The judge now goes on to summarise what weâ€ ™ ve just heard from her about the other three counts .
It looks as if we will get formal verdicts very soon .
She is likely to ask Pistorius to stand to hear them .
Moving on to culpable homicide , Masipa says Pistorius acted negligently .
A reasonable person , with a similar disability , would have foreseen that the person behind the door would be killed , and the accused failed to take action to avoid this .
The judge is now giving detailed legal explanations for why she has decided to acquit Pistorius of these murder charges .
She will be aware of the criticism following yesterdayâ€ ™ s proceedings , of course .
She says Pistorius can not be found guilty of murder by dolus directus ( premeditated ) or dolus eventualis ( that he foresaw that the shooting would lead to death ) .
It can not be said that he foresaw that the deceased or anyone else would be killed when he fired shots at the toilet door .
Masipa now recaps the four counts against Pistorius and her findings .
She says Pistoriusâ€ ™ account of what happened on the night he shot Reeva Steenkamp can â€œreasonably possibly be trueâ€ � .
She said there was no basis for the court to rule that Pistorius wanted to kill Steenkamp â€ “ no proof of motive .
The judge says the accusedâ€ ™ s case was that he was looking after the ammunition for his father , and did not intend to possess it .
This version â€œremains uncontrovertedâ€
� despite the lack of evidence to corroborate it .
He therefore can not be found guilty on this count .
Masipa says there would need to be intention to possess ammunition illegally in the legal sense .
It is possible to possess a firearm innocently â€ “ for example , picking up a gun to return it to its owner .
Masipa moves on to the final count against Pistorius .
Illegal possession of ammunition : Pistorius is charged with being in possession of .38 ammunition ; he does not have a licence for a gun that takes that ammunition , a permit to be in possession of it or a dealerâ€ ™ s licence .
Pistorius told the court the bullets belonged to his father and he had them for safe - keeping .
His estranged father declined to sign an affidavit confirming this .
The judge says Pistoriusâ€ ™ version was that he was angry with Fresco for having handed him a loaded firearm and reprimanded him .
But she questions why this version of events was not put to Fresco and another witness in the restaurant , boxer Kevin Lerena .
Masipa says Lerena was a good witness and she accepts his evidence .
She says Pistorius should be convicted of this charge .
Masipa :
He may not have intentionally pulled the trigger â€ ¦
That does not absolve him from the crime of negligence .
The incident in Tashas restaurant took place in January 2013 , only weeks before the shooting of Reeva Steenkamp .
Masipa moves on to another charge .
Count 3 is a charge of discharging firearms in public .
The prosecution says he discharged a firearm at a restaurant in January 2013 .
Pistorius said Fresco had passed him the loaded gun and denies he pulled the trigger .
In closing arguments , defence counsel Barry Roux said Pistorius had made a mistake and should be found guilty of a lesser charge of negligently discharging the firearm .
Masipa says the evidence â€œfalls shortâ€ � of the standard required : The state has failed to establish that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt on this count and has to be acquitted .
Masipa moves on to the evidence of Samantha Taylor .
Taylor was a former girlfriend of the accused .
It is common cause that the relationship did not end amicably .
It was clear â€ ¦ that she had been hurt by the manner in which the relationship had terminated .
But Masipa says this does not mean it would have affected the evidence she gave , or encouraged her to give false testimony .
She says Taylorâ€ ™ s version â€œhas a ring of truthâ€ � .
But she says the question is whether the state has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt .
Masipa says both Fresco and Taylor accused Pistorius of firing the gun , â€œbut there the similarities
endedâ€ � .
She says it was as if â€œthey were talking about different incidentsâ€ � .
She says Fresco was â€œnot an impressive witness at allâ€ � .
He was â€œdishonestâ€
� .
She repeats what she said yesterday in relation to Pistoriusâ€ ™ â€œuntruthfulnessâ€ � on the witness stand : that mendacity in one part of testimony
doesnâ€ ™ t mean it should all be disregarded .
However , she says caution is warranted in Frescoâ€ ™ s case due to the gaps and errors in his evidence .
Masipa points out that , in relation to the firing through the sunroof incident , the versions given by Pistorius , his former girlfriend Samantha Taylor , and his friend Darren Fresco , all differed .
Pistorius denied firing a shot through the open sunroof of the car .
The state said he did , and that it was an indication of his recklessness with firearms .
The fact that Masipa has moved on from count 1 â€ “ the shooting of Reeva Steenkamp â€
“ suggests she has nothing further to say about her reasoning on that verdict .
It looks as if we will hear verdicts on all four counts together , once she has explained her thinking on all four .
This strongly suggests that she will deliver a guilty verdict on the culpable homicide charge , given her acknowledgement that Pistorius acted â€œunlawfullyâ€ � , â€œtoo hastilyâ€ � and was â€œnegligentâ€ � .
Masipa apologises : she will deal with count 2 first .
This is another charge of discharging firearms in public .
Pistorius is accused of firing a gun through a car sunroof while he was with Fresco and Pistoriusâ€ ™ then girlfriend Samantha Taylor in November 2012 .
The athlete says he became angry after a police officer inspected his gun when the car was stopped for speeding ; the gun was apparently lying on a car seat .
But he denies firing a gun .
Both Taylor and Fresco say he did .
Masipa moves on to further counts â€
“
it looks as if she will return to the culpable homicide verdict later .
Count 3 is a charge of discharging firearms in public .
The prosecution says he discharged a firearm at a restaurant in January 2013 .
Pistorius said his friend Darren Fresco had passed him the loaded gun and denies he pulled the trigger .
In closing arguments , defence counsel Barry Roux said Pistorius had made a mistake and should be found guilty of a lesser charge of negligently discharging the firearm .
Judge Masipa is in the courtroom and will continue to read her verdict .
Even if the judge convicts Pistorius of a crime today â€ “ be it culpable homicide for the death of Reeva Steenkamp , and/or any of the other firearms offences â€
“
we will not see sentencing today .
If he is convicted , it is likely that he will have to reapply for bail ( which could happen today ) , since he will potentially be more of a flight risk .
There will then be an adjournment , probably for a few weeks , before further arguments and sentencing .
Pistorius would also have the option to appeal so could potentially remain at liberty for months or even years .
Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s family and friends are in court to hear the conclusion of the verdict .
June and Barry Steenkamp , Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents , were in court yesterday to hear the judge say there was not sufficient evidence to convict Pistorius of the murder of their daughter .
Newspapers in South Africa this morning are â€ “
unsurprisingly â€ “ dominated by yesterdayâ€ ™ s indication by Judge Masipa that Pistorius is not guilty of murder : But there are continuing questions over Masipaâ€ ™ s conclusion that this was not murder by dolus eventualis
â€ “ that he foresaw the consequences of shooting through the door could lead to death but went ahead anyway .
Some commentators believe she has wrongly interpreted the law .
And there are suggestions the decision to clear him of murder could face challenge : Pistorius has arrived at the high court : There could still be a manslaughter , or culpable homicide , conviction , if the judge believes Pistoriusâ€ ™ claim that he did not mean to kill Steenkamp , but decides he acted recklessly or negligently in firing into the locked door .
In the part of her ruling delivered on Thursday , the judge said she did believe the athlete had acted â€œtoo hastily and used excessive force â€ ¦
It is clear his conduct was negligent.â€
�
She will reveal her decision on Pistoriusâ€ ™ guilt or innocence on this charge this morning .
There is no minimum sentence in South African law for culpable homicide : it would be at the discretion of the judge .
Otherwise , given that murder charges have been dismissed , Pistorius could be acquitted if the judge accepts his account that he genuinely feared for his life .
But she has already disputed his claim that he was acting in self - defence in fear of a perceived intruder , adding that there was â€œno
reasonâ€ � why he could not have called for help instead of arming himself with a gun and approaching the bathroom .
Alongside the charge of murder , Pistorius is accused of two counts of discharging firearms in public , and another of illegal possession of ammunition .
Discharging firearms in public , first count : The prosecution says he discharged a firearm at a restaurant in January 2013 .
Pistorius said his friend Darren Fresco had passed him the loaded gun and denies he pulled the trigger .
In closing arguments , defence counsel Barry Roux said Pistorius had made a mistake and should be found guilty of a lesser charge of negligently discharging the firearm .
Discharging firearms in public , second count : Pistorius is accused of firing a gun through a car sunroof while he was with Fresco and Pistoriusâ€ ™ then girlfriend Samantha Taylor in November 2012 .
The athlete says he became angry after a police officer inspected his gun when the car was stopped for speeding ; the gun was apparently lying on a car seat .
But he denies firing a gun .
Both Taylor and Fresco say he did .
Illegal possession of ammunition : Pistorius is charged with being in possession of .38 ammunition ; he does not have a licence for a gun that takes that ammunition , a permit to be in possession of it or a dealerâ€ ™ s licence .
Pistorius told the court the bullets belonged to his father and he had them for safe - keeping .
If found guilty , Pistorius could face five years in prison on each of the first two counts , and 15 years for the illegal possession of ammunition .
Welcome to live coverage as the high court in Pretoria is set to reconvene to hear Judge Thokozile Masipa continue her ruling on the death of Reeva Steenkamp .
The judge did not give her formal verdict on Thursday .
But she has ruled out the possibility that Oscar Pistorius will be found guilty of the murder of his girlfriend on 14 February last year .
This morning she will move on to consider whether the athlete is guilty of culpable homicide ( manslaughter ) for shooting Steenkamp four times through a locked toilet door .
Pistorius has maintained he thought it was an intruder and did not mean to kill .
In the judgment she has delivered so far , Masipa has said : The state had failed to prove premeditated murder and the evidence was â€œpurely circumstantialâ€ � .
Pistorius will also not be found guilty of murder without premeditation ( dolus eventualis ) , as there was not sufficient evidence to suggest that he had foreseen that his actions could result in the death of the person behind the toilet door .
Nonetheless , it was clear that Pistorius had acted unlawfully in shooting the person behind the door .
A reasonable person would not have fired four shots into the toilet cubicle , because he would have foreseen the consequences : that somebody could be killed .
Pistorius acted â€œtoo hastily and used excessive force â€ ¦
It is clear his conduct was negligent.â€
�
You can read more details of Masipaâ€ ™ s ruling so far in this summary .
My colleague David Smith is in court in Pretoria ; his report on Thursdayâ€ ™ s proceedings is here .
Yesterdayâ€ ™ s live blog is here .
And you can follow us both on Twitter for updates and breaking news : @SmithInAfrica and@Claire_Phipps ."
2014-09-12,"Whether or not you think Oscar Pistorius got off lightly depends largely on where you stood on the case in the first place .
But the verdict is certainly controversial in South African legal circles .
There are many questions about whether the judge applied the law correctly , and suggestions that the State Prosecutor , Gerrie Nel , is already preparing his appeal .
It 's certainly hard for me to reconcile the letter of the law with the way the judgment played out .
The South African legal system allows for different kinds of murder convictions , and the one that 's relevant here is what is known as common - law murder with indirect intentions â€ “ or "" dolus eventualis "" .
According to the law , someone is guilty of murder if they know that their actions could lead to the killing of a person and reconcile themselves to that fact , and act anyway .
In delivering her ruling , judge Thokozile Masipa said that "" a reasonable person would have foreseen if he fired shots at the door , the person inside the toilet might be struck and might die as a result "" , which suggests a classic case of dolus eventualis .
But the judge seems to have cleared him of this charge because she felt that , to be guilty of common - law murder , Pistorius needed to have foreseen that his actions would kill a specific person â€ “ Reeva Steenkamp .
The state tried to prove that Pistorius was aware that it was Steenkamp behind the toilet door but the judge accepted the defence 's claims that he thought it was an intruder .
She put a lot of weight on the genuine remorse he showed after the fact , saying there 's no way he could have faked that .
This may be debatable ; and many people have suggested that if he had killed her in a fit of rage he would still be remorseful afterwards .
But what 's perhaps more interesting is the question of whether , even if he did think it was an intruder , he should be guilty of common - law murder in these circumstances
â€ “ and many people believe he should .
I would say that the law is clear â€ “ it does n't have to be a specific person whose death can be foreseen , it can be anyone .
If the rumours that the state is already preparing its appeal are true , this appeal can only take place after sentencing in October â€ “ and only on the grounds that the law was misinterpreted .
Nel would have to argue that a higher court would come to a different conclusion after hearing the same evidence .
What 's perhaps most likely is that the state will wait until the sentence is delivered , and base their decision on its severity .
If Pistorius is given what they consider a suitable term of , say , 10 years in jail , they may decide there is no need .
But a long jail term raises another possibility : that the defence will appeal in the hope of reducing it .
To my mind this would be very foolish .
There 's a possibility that another court may impose a harsher sentence or may reconsider the verdict of culpable homicide and convict him of murder .
So I think a defence appeal would not be wise in the circumstances .
Pistorius was charged with a schedule six premeditated - murder offence with a penalty of 25 years in jail .
Compared to that , the defence should be over the moon with the outcome .

2014-09-12,"Oscar Pistorius gunned down Reeva Steenkamp in the most intimate of private spaces , the bathroom .
The killing was as horribly violent as it was domestic .
An apparently textbook femicide in a country where hundreds of women are murdered by husbands or lovers each year .
Pistorius , charged with premeditated murder , claimed that he fired those four neatly clustered and lethal shots through the locked bathroom door because he thought there was an intruder in his house .
He seemed convinced that the idea of this imaginary intruder , this mythic danger , would excuse his violent and irrational behaviour .
And though he was acquitted on the murder charges , he ’s been convicted of culpable homicide because of the excessive force he used .
Yes , there is crime in South Africa .
Yes , it is often violent , but it is rare that it happens on the kind of secure estate on which Pistorius lived .
He was tapping into the old South African fear of an armed and dangerous black man that has its origins in the paranoid thinking of the apartheid era .
The discourse of racial fear was , in the democratic South Africa , quickly elided into an equally dangerous and paranoid discourse about crime .
Perhaps this was the only defensive straw to clutch , but the unflinching judicial light cast on this fear during the trial revealed a great deal more .
This pathological fear of crime is not uncommon in South Africa , which has been plagued by violence – political and criminal – for decades .
But in Pistorius ’s case , this fear seems to have had no rational basis .
There was no threat .
There had been no crime on the secure estate where Pistorius lived until he shot Steenkamp .
What was this state of terror that legitimised , in his mind , the use of lethal force in a place designed like a fortress ?
The trial shone a revealing light into this bland , brightly lit security estate that resembles a set from Desperate Housewives .
These estates – a vast gulag of fear window - dressed with the anodyne landscaping of an imagined suburban utopia – sprawl across South Africa .
Modern - day retreats that arm and defend against enemies who might not always be visible but are always there .
These estates , which their residents say are necessary for their families’ survival , are a blight on the face of South Africa ’s tarnished rainbow nation : privileged enclaves that represent a fantasy of safety , ringed by discreetly obscured barbed wire and electric fences set at almost lethal frequency , guarded by armed men – almost always black – who live in poor communities many kilometres away where the most basic policing rarely exists .
Steenkamp ’s killing showed once more – as if we needed reminding – that home is almost always the most dangerous place for a woman .
Femicide is a common crime in South Africa ; hundreds of women are killed by their partners each year .
Almost none of them makes it to the front page .
Pistorius ’s success and his fall , his celebrity , turned the spotlight away from Steenkamp ’s corpse , the gruesome detritus that was evidence of an uncontained male rage ( or fear ) , and on to her killer sitting in the dock .
Pistorius was not guilty of femicide , the terminal point of domestic violence .
But what we saw in the Pistorius trial is how this heedless , hidden violence manifests itself .
South African women and their children are all too often the collateral damage in a seemingly endless cycle of male violence that did not end with apartheid .
South Africa was defined by casual everyday social violence that was not a byproduct of apartheid , but its defining feature – and it has endured and thrived in the two decades since .
This is not to blame apartheid for Pistorius ’s actions .
It is a way of pointing out that the bullying , the brutality , the heedlessness , remains with us , alive and present and deadly .
This violence ranges from the vicious gang warfare that plagues many poor townships , to the shocking levels of drink - driving fatalities , to the negligent use of firearms .
Pistorius was unpleasant to watch on the stand .
He failed to accept any responsibility for his actions .
The whimpering , vomiting spectacle he presented sat uneasily with the stature he had reached as an Olympic champion who had succeeded against all odds .
The additional gun conviction against him showed the reckless and macho behaviour that is chillingly familiar to all of us who live here .
It was not difficult for the prosecution to build a picture of Pistorius – once
the iconic “ Blade Runner ” – as a narcissistic , controlling and selfish man whose love of guns , fast cars and risk overrode any consideration for the safety of others .
This aggressively swaggering masculinity is one that colours our social and political landscape .
It is – as Steenkamp learned by making that fatal female error of being in the wrong place at the wrong time – pervasive , toxic and lethal ."
2014-09-12,"It was the most shocking moment of the trial : when the state prosecutor confronted Oscar Pistorius with a close - up photo of Reeva Steenkamp , her hair matted dark with blood , the athlete recoiled in horror and his defence counsel jumped to his feet to object : ""
That is uncalled for .
"" There was no complaint , however , from the woman sitting stoically on the front row of the public gallery .
June Steenkamp , mother of the late model and law graduate , had been warned in advance that the image would be used .
Her lawyer advised her when to drop her gaze so she would not see it .
On Friday , Pistorius was found guilty of culpable homicide for shooting Reeva through a toilet door on Valentine 's Day last year .
He maintained that he had mistaken her for a burglar .
When the court adjourned , June could be seen shaking her head and hugging and comforting another family member .
Steenkamp 's close friend Gina Myers broke down and wept .
"" This verdict is not justice for Reeva , "" June Steenkamp later told NBC news .
"" I just want the truth . ""
Reeva died a "" horrible , painful , terrible "" death , she added , saying : "" He shot through the door and I ca n't believe that they believe it was an accident . ""
June , 67 , attended almost every day of Pistorius 's trial , while her husband Barry , 71 , who recently suffered a stroke , followed it on TV and joined her for the first time for closing arguments last month .
The rest of the world has been watching , debating and tweeting the case , which for the Steenkamps has meant constantly reliving the night of their 29-year - old daughter 's death . ""
It does n't go away , "" said Barry 's brother Mike Steenkamp .
"" The experience is a daily occurrence .
It 's not something you sweep under the carpet and it 's gone .
It 's up in your face all the time .
As it goes on , flashes of Reeva keep coming back . ""
Speaking before the trial , Mike said he would travel from Cape Town to be in court to support his brother for the verdict . ""
He does n't know how he will handle any situation .
He asked me to come up .
We 'll just have to see the results at the end of the day .
We 're leaving it in the Lord 's hands . ""
Reeva Steenkamp was born in Cape Town on 19 August 1983 , and moved to the city of Port Elizabeth as a child .
She graduated with a law degree from the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University but was spotted by a talent scout and launched a career in modelling .
She publicly denounced violence against women , and on the day she died she was due to give an inspirational talk at a school in Johannesburg .
Hagen Engler , a former editor of the South African edition of FHM magazine , for which Reeva was a cover star , said he had known her since around the age of 15 in Port Elizabeth , where they both grew up .
"" She was an amazing girl , a really intelligent person , "" he said .
"" She went into the modelling industry and had a mature understanding of it .
She had a funny sense of humour , like a guy 's sense of humour .
She was talented and was starting to succeed .
The girl was really going places . ""
Since her death , the Steenkamps have withdrawn to running a pub in a hamlet outside Port Elizabeth , but have been bombarded by media attention and interview requests .
Recently , June told Hello !
magazine that she still felt the presence of her daughter and talked to her all the time .
"" She 'll only rest in peace when this is over .
I trust that God will prevail and justice will be done .
All we want is the truth . ""
She said she had forgiven Pistorius .
The community in Port Elizabeth , in Eastern Cape province , founded by British settlers nearly two centuries ago , has been watching the trial closely .
Pete Pelser , a local businessman , said : "" I would guess about 40 % of the people watched it on a daily basis .
They were talking about it all the time . ""
Another local resident , Kerry Smith , said : "" Everyone 's now a lawyer and forensic pathologist .
Very few people have n't been talking about it .
A whole bunch called in sick when the trial started .
"" I think Pistorius 's cross - examination was the most watched television ever .
When he went in for a month of mental health observation , people were saying : ' What am I going to do during the day now ? '
"" Some in Port Elizabeth have turned against the couple for demanding fees for interviews .
But Smith , a friend of Reeva who met both her parents , said : "" There 's a lot of sympathy for Mr and Mrs Steenkamp .
It 's their only child together .
Reeva and her mum were totally inseparable and she idolised her dad –
she was a real daddy 's girl .
"" Smith knew Reeva for four years at university when they were law students and , after drifting apart , they renewed their friendship via Facebook .
She still becomes emotional when she hears their favourite songs –
Beyoncé 's Me , Myself and I and OutKast 's Hey Ya !
– on the radio .
"" We loved Beyoncé .
We used to call her Bouncy .
When I hear the songs , it 's not a sullen emotion that comes over me .
It 's sad but it 's happy - sad .
I remember the good things . ""
The part - time tutor , now 37 , has found the trial difficult viewing at times .
"" It 's been very emotional , especially when the photo was shown of her head shot .
I thought her hair 's black again , but then your brain processes it and you realise it 's blood .
It 's a shock for everyone to see it
but it 's a murder case .
"" The teenage Reeva participated in the Miss Port Elizabeth pageant and talent contests run by the local Herald newspaper .
Barbara Robertson , former fashion and beauty editor , who helped organise the events , said she was unmoved by Pistorius 's emotional breakdowns in court .
"" Every time I heard him vomit and every I time I heard him cry , I actually wanted to vomit myself , "" she said .
"" It was horrendous .
I thought : be a man .
I know others felt the same .
People here are very harsh on Oscar Pistorius .
Nobody gives him the benefit of the doubt . ""
She said the community was ready to move on .
"" We just want to say enough now .
Everybody in Port Elizabeth wants closure .
Most people 's attitude is : for God 's sake , let Reeva rest in peace now .
On Facebook we remember Reeva on birthdays and anniversaries .
People have n't forgotten her but let 's get on with our lives . ""
Robertson described her feelings during the trial : "" So sad .
So amazing but terribly sad .
She was the sweetest girl , kind to the underdog .
It filled me with sadness .
Especially for those of us who are parents . """
2014-09-13,"Oscar Pistorius plans to write a book giving his account of what happened when he shot dead his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , and his ordeal in standing trial for her murder , his manager said on Saturday .
The memoir could prove hugely lucrative for the Paralympian but also prompt accusations that he is cashing in on the killing of the 29-year - old model and law graduate .
Pistorius was acquitted of murder at the high court in Pretoria , South Africa , last week but convicted of culpable homicide after shooting Steenkamp through a locked toilet door at his home .
He was released on bail and will be sentenced at a hearing that starts on 13 October .
As Steenkamp 's parents expressed dismay at the verdict and headed home to Port Elizabeth , Pistorius 's manager and agent , Peet van Zyl , revealed that the double amputee athlete intends to put his side of the story on paper . ""
He will write his own book , "" he told the Observer .
"" We 've discussed it .
We 've talked about ideas and concepts .
I 'm not going to go into details now . ""
If Pistorius receives a suspended sentence , as some experts predict , he could also return to competition , possibly even in time for the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics in Rio .
He is known to be regularly working out to stay in good physical condition .
The International Paralympic Committee has said it will allow its most famous athlete to return to the sport .
Van Zyl said : "" I will sit down with him once everything is done and decide what we are going to do .
We have to wait until 13 October before we can think about anything .
After that we will tell the world what we are going to do . ""
Pistorius published an autobiography , Blade Runner – a reference to his nickname due to his prosthetic limbs – five years ago .
But after that he reached the pinnacle of the London Olympics only to be author of his own downfall when he killed Steenkamp at his home in Pretoria on St Valentine 's day last year .
A book about the shocking episode could be a bestseller , enabling Pistorius to restore personal finances that have been exhausted by legal fees , but also risk charges of exploiting the situation .
OJ Simpson , the American actor and sportsman cleared of murder after another blockbuster trial in 1995 , was criticised for publishing a book entitled If I Did It , in which he hypothetically described how he would have killed his ex - wife and her friend .
Pistorius has always maintained that he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder when he shot her four times .
But speaking to ITV News after the verdict , her parents , June and Barry Steenkamp , said they did not "" fully "" believe his account of that night .
June said of the judge 's ruling : "" We were shocked .
Shocked .
Disappointed .
You know your heart drops because you just want the truth .
It 's going in the wrong direction ,
that 's how you feel . ""
Ben Williams , books editor of South Africa 's Sunday Times , said a book by Pistorius "" could go either way .
If you do it right , you could have the sports biography of the century .
On the other hand , he 's not the most popular person in some circles so you could have a tremendous backlash that sinks the book .
Look what happened to Julian Assange 's autobiography . ""
As Pistorius contemplates the project , other authors are racing to put out books about a case that has captivated millions of people in South Africa and around the world .
Williams said he is aware of half a dozen titles from mainstream publishers plus "" innumerable "" self - published ebooks .
Few would be surprised if the nascent Pistorius publishing industry leads to a film or TV dramatisation .
"" It 's because Oscar was the person who defined South Africa , "" Williams added .
"" I thought he was going to be the next iconic figure after Nelson Mandela .
It 's all gone horribly wrong and the amount of interest is spectacular .
I 've no doubt there will be a made - for - TV movie – that 's definitely going to happen . ""
Last week saw the publication of Oscar : An Accident Waiting to Happen , co - written by Patricia Taylor whose daughter , Samantha , was a girlfriend of the sprinter and testified during his trial .
It is billed as "" the all - exclusive inside story of ex - girlfriend Samantha Taylor 's tumultuous romantic relationship with the gold - medal athlete which turned into every mother 's nightmare "" .
South African journalist Barry Bateman 's coverage of the trial gained him 139,000 new Twitter followers in a week ; he now stands at 227,000 .
He is the co - writer , with Mandy Wiener , of Behind the Door :
The Oscar and Reeva Steenkamp Story , due out next month in countries including the UK .
Bateman said there has already been interest in the book from producers looking for a screenplay .
He described the making of a movie about the case as "" inevitable "" .
Another contender is Chase Your Shadow : the Trials of Oscar Pistorius , published internationally in December .
Its writer , British journalist John Carlin , said : "" I 've had contracts since a year ago , which tells you there 's a universality about this story .
It fits into a recognisable narrative pattern going back to Homer .
It is a classic tragic hero 's fall . ""
Carlin , author of a biography of tennis player Rafael Nadal , and of the book Playing the Enemy about Nelson Mandela and the 1995 rugby world cup , which became the film Invictus , said he would be very surprised if Pistorius returns to the track .
"" I do n't think it 's in his thoughts in a serious way at all , "" he said .
"" I find it extremely unlikely that he 's going to go back to what he was .
Whatever the outcome of the trial , the controversy will linger on , as it did with OJ Simpson .
There are loads of people who will think he killed Reeva deliberately .
If he turns up on athletics track in Manchester or Dusseldorf or wherever , there will be protesters with placards . """
2014-09-13,"Throughout the Oscar Pistorius trial , Judge Thokozile Masipa stood as a figure of pride for many black South Africans .
There she was , a black woman presiding over a globally televised spectacle .
In front of her were two armies of mainly white lawyers .
The accused was a white Afrikaner .
Except for the interpreters and a few witnesses , most of those who were called to the stand were white .
The witnesses included Pistorius 's white neighbours , his white friends and associates as well as other white people he had come across in his personal and professional life .
In a country where race is still a major fact of life , the significance of all these whites daily showing deference to a black woman was not lost on the millions avidly following the trial .
She was their pride as she imperiously but unobtrusively directed proceedings .
This pride was matched last week by disappointment when Masipa acquitted the Paralympian of murder and instead found him guilty of culpable homicide .
When her legal reasoning was questioned and ridiculed , it was as if she had let the entire side down .
The source of pride had become a target of derision , and this hurt badly .
The disappointment was accompanied by a deflation from the millions - strong armchair jury who had long found him guilty .
They drew racial comparisons between the treatment of Pistorius and that of musician Molemo "" Jub Jub "" Maarohanye , who was jailed for killing schoolchildren while drag - racing under the influence of drugs and alcohol .
The murder verdict and 20-year sentence in that case has been contrasted with the failure to reach a similar conclusion in a case that was believed to be much more clear - cut .
Despite the fact that the Masipa is black , this verdict was seen as proof justice still has a racial tint .
The simple perception was that white wealth equals access to superior justice .
The desire to see Pistorius go to jail for a long time is a far cry from the awe in which he was once held by black South Africa .
In his heyday he was the genuine crossover hero , loved in equal measure by black and white .
He crossed that divide in which football stars are worshipped by blacks and rugby and cricket stars are worshipped by whites .
He was one of the few unifying figures in a nation still trying to achieve cohesion .
Following the February 2013 killing of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp , he continues to bridge racial divides – but this time he unites blacks and whites in disgust and condemnation rather than celebration .
With his fall from grace , South Africa lost a common hero .
In a way , then , Pistorius 's demise has removed a small but significant brick in the country 's nation - building project .
What the six - month trial exposed – besides the common global voyeurism – was how close to the surface race bubbles in South Africa .
It is the quick and easy resort for suspicions , blame , and answers .
The Pistorius matter reminded the country just how elusive the rainbow still remains .
Mondli Makhanya is an editor at large for City Press , based in Johannesburg"
2014-09-15,"Sir Philip Craven , the International Paralympic Committee president , has claimed its stance on whether Oscar Pistorius , 27 , would be free to compete again has been â€œmisinterpretedâ€ � .
Craven , the Bolton - born president of the IPC , said he had been watching the Pistorius trial unfold over the past 18 months but insisted no decision had been taken on when the athlete , found guilty of South Africaâ€ ™ s equivalent of manslaughter for shooting his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , would be allowed to compete in the Paralympics .
â€œThis is coming to some form of conclusion and weâ€ ™ re awaiting the sentencing , â€ � Craven said .
â€œMaybe the answer was misinterpreted .
We were talking about the theoretical possibility if it fell into place .
Itâ€ ™ s not appropriate to comment on whether he could be back competing in the future before we get more information .
â€œThere has not been any word of us welcoming his return or opening the door etc etc .
Weâ€ ™ ve got so much on our plate that weâ€ ™ re concentrating on that.â€ �
Craven is to host an IPC meeting in Berlin in October to celebrate 25 years of the organisation and said it would focus on three main priorities : â€œMaintaining momentum of Paralympic Games , supporting the development of many more Paralympic athletes all over the world and continuing to develop world championships , regional games and national championships.â€
�
Some of the athletes who came to prominence at the London 2012 Paralympics have complained that there has not been enough done to maintain elite level competition in the four years until the next Games , in Rio .
Craven said he could understand the frustrations but that the IPC was committed to improving the number of high profile events between Games .
â€œWhen you get a taste for something great you want more of it , â€ � he said .
â€œThat is what weâ€ ™ ve put into motion in athletics and swimming - the quantity of the events has to improve and the quality .
â€œWe are here for the long haul .
This movement is going to be developing over the next 25 , 50 , 100 years .
I hope weâ€ ™ ve laid the foundations.â€ �
Craven said he was also heartened by the fact that more countries , including the US , were planning to broadcast live coverage of the Rio Paralympics .
â€œIâ€ ™ m confident that will happen , â€ � he said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s one of our main objectives with Rio 2016 .
What we wish to do is inspire and excite the entire world .
â€œA big piece of that puzzle is that NBC will be showing live coverage .
Progress is being made but when youâ€ ™ re an athelte you want everyone to happen all at once.â€ �"
2014-10-12,"It was the trial that had everything : a love story , a sporting hero who overcame disability to star at the Olympics , a photogenic model girlfriend and a shocking Valentineâ€ ™ s Day killing .
Millions of South Africans will tune in on Monday to see whether Oscar Pistorius will be jailed after his conviction for culpable homicide .
The athlete faces a sentence of up to 15 years , although as a first - time offender who the court accepted showed genuine remorse after shooting Reeva Steenkamp , he could be treated leniently by Judge Thokozile Masipa .
Masipa caused an outcry last month when she found the athlete not guilty of murder for shooting his girlfriend four times through a locked bathroom door , and an impact statement from her parents , expected to be read out at the four - day hearing , is likely to inflame emotions .
The â€œtrial of the centuryâ€ � , which began in March , dominated the media , with Pistorius , prosecutor Gerrie Nel and defence counsel Barry Roux knocking President Jacob Zuma and even a general election off the front pages .
It was obsession that cut across class , gender and race .
â€œIâ€
™ m amazed itâ€ ™ s become a cultural reference point , â€ � said Justice Malala , a political broadcaster and columnist .
â€œYou donâ€
™ t need an explainer when you talk about Oscar .
You say , â€˜I put it to youâ€ ™ and people know you mean Barry Roux .
They know who Gerrie Nel
is.â€
�
The flames were fanned when a judge ruled that , for the first time , the trial could be broadcast live on television , although witnesses could choose to remain off camera so only their voices were heard .
Tiny cameras in unobtrusive white cases were installed in the wood - panelled court in Pretoria at great expense .
One South African broadcaster launched a 24-hour TV channel offering gavel - to - gavel coverage , replays and studio analysis .
It was the brainchild of producer George Mazarakis .
â€œIt was just such momentous story and a story on so many levels , â€ � he explained .
â€œHereâ€ ™ s this titan of a human being , part man , part machine , almost a mythical being , and then he has this fall from grace .
She was this gorgeous creature .
It came across to me this is a Greek tragedy playing out with two lives indelibly damaged .
It was irresistible.â€ �
Mazarakis said the channel was hugely popular , although he was unwilling to disclose viewing figures , and lack of advertising meant it did not make money .
â€œAdvertisers didnâ€ ™ t want to be part of something negative like a murder trial but they missed the point of the social glue this was creating .
It appealed to all South Africans : it hasnâ€ ™ t been a particular sector at all .
Everyone had an opinion and found it fascinating across the board .
He represented us as a country and we mustnâ€ ™
t forget that .
We felt this was a tragedy that affected us as a nation.â€ �
For many the trial became irresistible viewing at home or in the office .
Roger Dixon , a defence witness , recalled : â€œSome people were glued morning , noon and night .
It came close to the lure of a soap opera or Big Brother or MasterChef
â€ “ whatâ€ ™ s going to happen next ?
Itâ€ ™ s people living vicariously .
They donâ€ ™ t have much going on in their own lives so they watch others.â€
�
Dixon said the cameras were intrusive and led to him being publicly ridiculed .
At the end of his case , Roux said a number of witnesses simply refused to testify because â€œthey didnâ€ ™ t want their voices all over the world , â€ �
â€ “ paving the way for a possible appeal .
A source close to Pistorius complained that it had been a media trial : â€œYouâ€ ™ ve got to be a halfwit to think itâ€ ™ s a fair trial.â€ �
But defenders of the TV coverage argue that it opened South Africaâ€ ™ s courts to the public as never before .
Millions who had never before experienced a criminal trial learned about the workings of the judicial system and what it takes to be a witness .
Young people may have been inspired to study law .
It was perhaps the ultimate exercise in transparent justice .
Education or entertainment , or both ?
Mazarakis insisted :
â€œI donâ€ ™ t think it was voyeuristic at all .
Most South Africans didnâ€
™ t know how the legal system worked and hadnâ€ ™ t been in a court .
They learned all of that .
In fact universities have had to up the pass rate for admissions to law school because there has been such an upsurge of applications.â€ � Johan Burger , a former police officer , now a senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies in Pretoria , said : â€œOn the one hand , thereâ€ ™ s always a danger of a trial such as this becoming a circus in that everybody performs for the media .
Itâ€ ™ s less about the case than how I as a person am seen .
After what happened with the O J Simpson trial in the US , I was worried we would see a repeat .
â€œBut at the same time itâ€ ™ s educational .
There are legal terms that ordinary people are completely unfamiliar with .
There are the ways a court functions .
People are now a lot more aware of the difficulties of prosecuting someone , and in future if they witness a crime they may be aware of what theyâ€ ™ re observing , bearing in mind what questions the witnesses were asked.â€ �
Many comparisons have been made to the 1995 Simpson trial , but there was one crucial difference : social media .
From the moment Pistorius walked into court to apply for bail in February last year , Twitter went wild .
Journalist Barry Bateman gained 139,000 followers in a week and is co - authoring a book about the case .
Emma Sadleir , a media law consultant , had a slot on the 24-hour trial channel answering viewerâ€ ™ questions via social media .
She reflected : â€œPeople asked the most rudimentary questions : whereâ€ ™ s the jury ?
Who is that sitting next to the judge ?
For me it was incredible to see peopleâ€
™ s reactions to what was going on , to see justice being done .
Before this theyâ€ ™ d only see it in Hollywood movies.â€ �
Juries were abolished in South Africa in the 1960s and so there was no risk of jurors being swayed by the cacophony of voices .
Instead it was a free - for - all for journalists , pundits and anyone with an opinion and internet connection .
There was plenty of humour , with spoof Twitter accounts and rap songs featuring Nel and Roux .
There were also the â€œPistoriansâ€ � , an international , mainly female group who fiercely champion the athlete and often lash out at his critics .
Sadleir , co - author of Donâ€ ™ t Film Yourself
Having Sex and Other Legal Advice For the Age of Social Media , was among those who felt their wrath .
â€œThe trial has been an illustration of everything good about social media and an illustration of everything bad about social media , â€ �
she said .
â€œIt was one of the most seminal moments in our legal history .
As an educational thing it has been absolutely brilliant .
It is a natural extension of open justice and will set a precedent.â€ � Twenty years after apartheid , South Africa remains a notoriously racialised society , not least on the sports field : football is still dominated by black people , whereas rugby is primarily white .
The Pistorius case , however , appears to transcend demographics , as compelling as the sensational murder trials that thrilled Victorian newspaper readers .
Cassandra Fani , 24 , a black former athlete who trained with Pistorius and supported him in court , said : â€œEveryone was talking about it .
My friends , most of whom are black , were talking about it .
Heâ€ ™ s
a public figure who did well at the Olympics , so everyone is involved .
It wasnâ€ ™ t just the white part of South Africa but South Africa as a whole.â€ �
Most perpetrators and victims of crime in South Africa are black .
The Pistorius trial inverted this , which might be one reason for its morbid fascination , according to Eusebius McKaiser , an author and radio talkshow host .
â€œThe unlikely victim and unlikely accused is an element , â€ �
he said .
â€œMany black South Africans were probably bemused that here you have a white boy who went to Pretoria boys high school , came from a middle - class family , was a goody two - shoes and he killed his girlfriend , something we usually associate with a black thug in a township .
Itâ€ ™ s very unexpected and so thereâ€
™ s a voyeurism there.â€

2014-10-13,"At the end of the first day of Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ s sentencing hearing , hereâ€ ™ s where we are : Pistoriusâ€ ™ s defence team has called three out of four witnesses to testify in mitigation of sentencing : a psychologist , a Correctional Services social worker , and the athleteâ€ ™ s manager .
Social worker Joel Maringa told the court that he recommended Pistorius undergo house arrest for three years , with 16 hours of community service per month .
The stateâ€ ™ s Gerrie Nel , who will be pushing for the most punitive possible jail term , called this suggestion â€œshockingly inappropriateâ€ � .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s psychologist and manager , respectively , have painted the picture of a broken man who is nonetheless humble and charitable , and who poses no danger to society .
Tomorrow morning , when we resume , Gerrie Nel will have the opportunity to cross - examine Pistoriusâ€ ™ s manager Peet van Zyl .
After that , the defence is expected to call their final witness , whereafter the state will begin to lead their own witnesses in evidence .
Judge Thokozile Masipa indicated at the beginning of todayâ€ ™ s proceedings that she did not expect the hearing to last longer than one week .
Thank you for following todayâ€ ™ s coverage .
Weâ€ ™ ll be back tomorrow .
The first day of the sentencing hearing for Oscar Pistorius has come to an early close , with the prosecutionâ€ ™ s Gerrie Nel requesting to stand the matter down so that he has time to study the thick report which manager Peet van Zyl has compiled on Pistoriusâ€ ™ s charity work .
Judge Masipa assents , and court is adjourned until 9.30am
( South Africa time ) on Tuesday .
If I can use the word â€˜brightâ€ ™ , it would be an understatement .
â€ “ Pistoriusâ€ ™ s agent Peet van Zyl , describing the athleteâ€ ™ s future prior to the shooting .
Van Zyl said that since the verdict was handed down , Pistorius has lost every contract with sponsors .
He claims that he and Pistorius have not discussed Pistoriusâ€ ™ s future career beyond the trial .
Among the high - profile sporting figures who requested Pistoriusâ€ ™ s involvement in various charity endeavours were tennis player Novak Djokovic , former footballer Bobby Charlton and British Olympic chief Sebastian Coe .
We may be here for a while :
In the last session of the day , Pistoriusâ€ ™ s manager Peet van Zyl has taken his place on the stand once again to continue testifying as to Pistoriusâ€ ™ s charity work .
From South Africa , AFP is reporting that if Oscar Pistorius is given a sentence of house arrest , it may cause resentment : A non - custodial sentence would be likely to spark public anger , fuelling a perception among black South Africans that , 20 years after the end of apartheid , wealthy whites can still secure preferential justice .
â€œAt the end of the day a young lady was killed and someone should pay for it
, â€ � said 57-year - old Mildred Lekalakala , a member of the Womenâ€ ™ s League of the ruling African National Congress .
Itâ€ ™ s the first day of Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ s sentencing hearing , and three defence witnesses have appeared on the stand thus far to testify in mitigation of sentencing .
Dr Lore Hartzenberg , who gave Pistorius grief counselling after the shooting of Reeva Steenkamp , testified that the athlete was a â€œbroken manâ€ � who was â€œunlikely to fully recoverâ€ � .
Dr Hartzenberg said that Pistorius never expressed any desire to pursue his athletics career post - trial , saying he hoped to work at a school in Mozambique instead .
Joel Maringa , a state social worker , read from a report concluding that Pistorius would be a good candidate for house arrest rather than a prison sentence â€ “ though he should be declared unfit to own a gun .
Maringa said he would advise that a sentence of house arrest not exceed three years , with Pistorius made to carry out 16 hours of community service per month
â€ “ in the form of cleaning â€ “ at local museums and hospitals .
Maringa appeared to contradict Dr Hartzenbergâ€ ™ s testimony when he said that Pistorius had told him he wished to return to professional athletics .
When we adjourned for lunch , Pistoriusâ€ ™ s manager Peet van Zyl was listing all the charity work Pistorius has undertaken over the past few years .

Lunch break at the North Gauteng High Court .
After the hourâ€ ™ s recess , weâ€ ™ ll resume with Pistoriusâ€ ™ s manager Peet van Zyl still on the stand .
Peet van Zyl mentions the occasion in December 2012 when Pistorius raced against a horse in Qatar and won .
Watch it here
: Van Zyl admits that this was not a charity project : â€œMy job was to make money for Mr Pistoriusâ€ � .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s manager testifies that the athlete was due to launch his own charitable foundation in July 2013 , after working closely with the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow .
The university awarded Pistorius an honorary doctorate in November 2012 .
At the time , Pistorius said : The people of Scotland are always so warm and welcoming towards me , and I think of it as my second home .
Peet van Zyl lists a number of charity initiatives that Oscar Pistorius participated in free of charge : among others , for Unicef and Cheshire Homes , as well as charitable programmes for his sponsors .
( After the shooting of Steenkamp , Nike had to withdraw an ad featuring Pistorius with a more unfortunate slogan . )
The next witness on the stand is Pistoriusâ€ ™ s long - time manager Peet van Zyl , who also testified during the trial .
The defenceâ€ ™ s Barry Roux tells the court that van Zyl will be giving evidence on Pistoriusâ€ ™ s charity work , and the status of his athletic career .
With no further questions from the defence or the prosecution , Judge Masipa wants some more details on the community service that Maringa envisages Pistorius undertaking .
In contradiction to the testimony of previous witness Dr Lore Hartzenberg , social worker Joel Maringa testifies that Oscar Pistorius told him that he wanted to return to athletics .
Maringa suggested one reason why house arrest might be suitable would be because it would enable Pistorius to continue to train .
When Nel asked Maringa how long he would recommend that Pistorius undergo house arrest , he replied that three years would be suitable .
â€œThat is shockingly inappropriate , â€ �
Nel retorts .
While Nel and Maringa duke it out over whether or not Maringa is sufficiently au fait with
Judge Masipaâ€ ™ s findings in this matter , hereâ€ ™ s a Department of Correctional Services fact - sheet on what house arrest constitutes in South Africa :
House arrest refers to that portion of the day / night when the probationer does not work and is compelled to be at home .
The period of house arrest of individual probationers may differ .
The possible risk posed to the community is taken into account when determining the probationerâ€ ™ s placement under house arrest .
When the condition of house arrest is being set , the offenderâ€ ™ s working hours are taken into account in order to avoid conflict between such hours and the period of house arrest .
Flexibility is also built into the condition of house arrest to allow probationers to participate in organized sport activities , to attend church services , to do the necessary shopping , etc .
Nel and Maringa are quibbling over the details of the crimes of which Pistorius was convicted .
Nel asks how Maringa can make a recommendation on appropriate penalties if he is unfamiliar with the findings of the court in this case .
The stateâ€ ™ s Gerrie Nel will now cross - examine defence witness Joel Maringa .
State social worker Maringa suggests that Pistorius could undertake community service at the nearby Transvaal Museum ( currently known as the Ditsong Museum of Natural History ) , or
Pretoriaâ€ ™ s Little Company of Mary Hospital .
State social worker Joel Maringa notes that while Pistoriusâ€ ™ s behaviour in general can be considered â€œsocially acceptableâ€ � , this is tarnished by his track record with guns .
The athlete should not be allowed to own further guns , Maringa recommends .
Correctional Services social worker Joel Maringa says that Pistorius would be a good candidate for house arrest , subject to strict conditions .
Maringa reads out a potted CV of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s sporting career , including his Paralympic successes .
Maringa has prepared a report on the suitability of Oscar Pistorius undergoing house arrest , rather than a prison sentence .
He is about to start reading his findings .
The next witness has taken the stand .
His name is Joel Maringa , and he is a social worker in the Department of Correctional Services .
Roux says he hasnâ€ ™ t consulted with Maringa before now .
Maringa has no option but to allow his testimony to be broadcast on TV , because he is a public servant .
No further questions from Gerrie Nel to Dr Lore Hartzenberg .
The defenceâ€ ™ s Barry Roux now has his chance to re - examine his witness , but after being shut down for a â€œleading questionâ€ � in attempting to counter the reports of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s new girlfriend , he says he has no further questions either .
Hartzenberg concedes under questioning from Nel that she cried during the trial while witnessing Pistorius take his prosthetic legs off .
Nel asks Hartzenberg if she has heard reports that Pistorius already has a â€œnew lady friendâ€ � , as alleged by UK tabloids at the trialâ€ ™ s outset .
Hartzenberg says she did read about it , but Pistorius never discussed it with her .
The reports claimed that Pistorius had embarked on a relationship with a family friend after the two holidayed together in Mozambique .
Hereâ€ ™ s South Africaâ€ ™ s City Press :
A holiday maker in Inhambane at the time told City Pressâ€ ™ sister newspaper , Rapport , that Pistorius and [ the alleged girlfriend ] kept things discreet while they were together .
â€œThey werenâ€ ™ t kissing or holding hands or anything .
Their most intimate exchange was when they shared a bottle of water , â€ � the holiday maker said , adding the two were never alone and always part of a group .
After a longer than expected break , court is back in session in Pretoria , with Dr Lore Hartzenberg still on the stand .
The claim by Pistoriusâ€ ™ s psychologist that the athlete hopes to devote his future to working at a school in Mozambique may raise some eyebrows , but Pistorius has spoken before about his affection for the country which borders South Africa .
Speaking to the Guardian in 2011 , Pistorius said : I must admit I quite like Mozambique , itâ€ ™ s pretty unspoiled , pretty rural .
Itâ€ ™ s a beautiful place , really low - key and down - to - earth and the people are friendly .
I really enjoy it there , apart from the fact that thereâ€ ™ s no cell phone signal , although I guess that might be a perk .
There are a couple of places that have captured my heart for different reasons , and thatâ€ ™ s one of them .
Hereâ€ ™ s a video of Oscar Pistorius arriving at the North Gauteng High Court this morning :
While the Pretoria court is in adjournment , hereâ€ ™ s a summary of the most significant aspects of this morningâ€ ™ s proceedings in Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ s sentencing hearing up till now .
The defence is likely to call four witnesses , and the prosecution at least two .
It is anticipated that matters will conclude within a week .
The defenceâ€ ™ s first witness is Pistoriusâ€ ™ s personal psychologist Dr Lore Hartzenberg , who began counselling the athlete after the shooting of Steenkamp and has testified as to his stress , PTSD and depression , as well as his remorse and regret .
Hartzenberg said that during their sessions , Pistorius had not expressed any interest in resuming his career in professional athletics .
Instead , he wanted to go and work at a school in Mozambique .
Pistorius carried photographs of Steenkamp after the shooting , Hartzenberg said .
Court is adjourned for Gerrie Nel to consult with a state psychologist on the report delivered by Dr Hartzenberg .
Weâ€ ™ ll be back at 11.15am South Africa time â€ “ in just over half an hour .
Hartzenberg says that Pistorius told her that Reeva Steenkamp was a model and â€œinvolved in some projectsâ€ � .
Hartzenberg concedes that she learnt most biographical information on Steenkamp from media reports rather than Pistorius , who only discussed his relationship with her .
She says Pistorius carried photos of Steenkamp with him .
Nel wants to discuss a visit Pistorius took to a Johannesburg nightclub during his murder trial .
If Pistorius was so traumatised by the global media scrutiny of him , why would he risk such an outing ?
Hartzenberg suggests that such behaviour might reflect a desire to escape from trauma .
â€œIn his heart and mind
, Miss Steenkamp was the one ,
â€ �
Hartzenberg says Pistorius told her .
She concedes that he had serious relationships prior to Steenkamp : â€œHe always had someone in his lifeâ€ � .
Nel has brought up Pistoriusâ€ ™ s ex - girlfriend Samantha Taylor , whose mother Patricia has recently released a tell - all account of her relationship with the athlete .
Itâ€ ™ s early days in the sentencing hearing , but Gerrie Nel is already adopting a decidedly combative approach to the defenceâ€ ™ s first witness .
Dr Hartzenberg says she isnâ€ ™ t â€œawareâ€ � of Pistorius ever receiving psychological help from a professional prior to the shooting .
Nel asks if Hartzenberg had a session with Pistorius after the judgment .
She says they did , but they didnâ€ ™ t discuss Pistoriusâ€ ™ s intentions in firing the gun .
Gerrie Nel asks if Hartzenberg has ever counselled families who lost a child .
He clearly wants to press the point that the trauma and pain of Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s family should be taken into account alongside Pistoriusâ€ ™ s psychological suffering .
Is it correct to say that Pistorius will not pursue a future as a professional athlete , Nel persists .
Under cross - examination from Nel , Dr Hartzenberg has claimed that Pistorius never expressed any desire to pursue an athletic career after the trial .
â€œWe took one day at a time , â€ � she says .
The International Paralympic Committee has said that they would have no objections to Pistorius continuing to compete .
Hartzenberg says the only thing Pistorius mentioned about future plans was that it might bring him pleasure to work at a school that his uncle is affiliated with in Mozambique .
With no further questions from Pistoriusâ€ ™ s lawyer Barry Roux , it is the turn of the prosecutionâ€ ™ s Gerrie Nel to cross - examine Dr Lore Hartzenberg .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s personal psychologist Dr Lore Hartzenberg has painted a picture of a man who will suffer persistent trauma as a result of the shooting and its legal aftermath .
A major theme of Hartzenbergâ€ ™ s testimony so far has been a criticism of the effects of negative media coverage on Pistorius .
The athlete feels that these reports were premised on â€œinaccurate factsâ€ � about the shooting .
â€œI have never found [ Pistorius ] to be anything other than a respectful , caring and well - mannered person ,
â€ � Dr Hartzenberg says .
She has never seen him lose his temper , but can testify to his anxiety .
Mr Pistorius is essentially a lonely person â€ “ Psychologist Dr Lore Hartzenberg Pistoriusâ€ ™ s concern for Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents was an â€œunremitting themeâ€ � of his therapy sessions .
Hartzenberg stresses the athleteâ€ ™ s remorse , regret and feelings of being â€œbereftâ€ � without Steenkamp , with whom he was planning a future .
â€œInitially Mr Pistorius presented with acute stress reaction , â€ � Hartzenberg reads from her report .
Subsequently he showed signs of PTSD and depression .
Pistorius manifested overwhelming â€œguilt and remorseâ€ � , and sometimes had to excuse himself from sessions due to retching while describing the shooting .
â€œInitially it was very difficult , â€ � says Hartzenberg of her first sessions with Pistorius .
â€œHe was very emotionalâ€
� .
Her own voice seems to be wavering with emotion too .
When Dr Hartzenberg was approached to be a witness , her attitude was that as Pistoriusâ€ ™ s therapist , she was reluctant to become involved in the case .
After being requested to write a report on her observations of the athlete during psychotherapy , however , she decided to share her insights with the court .
Hartzenberg has been seeing Pistorius for around 18 months , starting sessions with him as a grief counsellor after the shooting of Steenkamp .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s lawyer Barry Roux has indicated that the defence will be calling three witnesses , with a potential fourth from the Department of Correctional Services .
The prosecutionâ€ ™ s Gerrie Nel has said that they will be calling â€œat leastâ€ � two witnesses .
When Judge Masipa asked Nel if he thought they would be able to wrap things up within a week , he replied : â€œI hope soâ€
� .
The first witness for the defence will be Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ s personal psychologist , Dr Lore Hartzenberg , who will not be shown on TV .
Dr Hartzenberg has been present at various points in the trial to comfort Pistorius .
Judge Thokozile Masipa has entered the courtroom and taken her seat .
The hearing will resemble a mini - trial , in the sense that both the prosecution and defence will call witnesses and present evidence in mitigation and aggravation of sentencing .
The defence will lead witnesses first .
These are expected to include medical experts and psychologists , to testify as to the extent of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s disability and his concomitant vulnerability .
They may also argue that Pistoriusâ€ ™ s high profile would make him a target in prison .
The prosecutionâ€ ™ s witnesses will follow , and they may include firearms experts
â€ “ to testify as to Pistoriusâ€
™ s negligence in firing blindly through a door â€ “ and representatives from Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s inner circle .
It is common in South African cases like this for the family of the victim to give evidence .
But the lawyer for Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents , Dup de Bruyn , has told South African news channel eNCA that Barry and June Steenkamp will not take the stand .
When asked if the Steenkamps would be called as witnesses by the State , De Bruyn replied , â€œNoâ€ � adding , â€œI donâ€
™ t think they are healthy enough to go through the trauma of being on the standâ€ � .
He said : â€œAnyone who has lost a child will be able to understand their trauma.â€ �
There are three days set aside for the hearing this week .
Itâ€ ™ s possible that Judge Masipa may be ready to hand down sentence by Wednesday , but she may also adjourn the court again to consider the evidence and set another date for sentencing thereafter .
A new addition to the Pretoria courtroom today : a security scanner .
In South Africa opinion among legal experts has been divided as to the sentence the judge is likely to hand down .
The majority of those surveyed by local newspaper the Times predicted that Pistorius would not see the inside of a jail cell .
Others disagree , saying the athlete is looking at a potential 10-year jail sentence , though possibly part suspended .
Factors likely to be considered by the judge in mitigation of sentencing include : that Pistorius is a first - time offender ; that he has made a contribution to South African society through his sporting achievements ; that he is disabled and has medical needs which may not easily be met in prison ; and that he has displayed remorse for the shooting of Steenkamp .
The judge may also take into account South Africaâ€ ™ s massively overcrowded prison system .
In 2013 the country was reported to have the highest prison population in Africa .
The purpose of imprisonment is defined by South Africaâ€ ™ s Correctional Services Act as having the objective of â€œenabling [ the offender ] to lead a socially responsible and crime - free life in the futureâ€ � .
Pistorius has made his entrance at the Pretoria court .
Judge Masipa has an enormous amount of discretion over what Pistoriusâ€ ™ s fate will be .
Oscar Pistorius could receive a prison sentence .
In South Africa there is neither a minimum nor a maximum prison sentence for culpable homicide , despite the widely - reported notion that the prescribed maximum is 15 years .
Sentences for culpable homicide do not tend to exceed 10 years : South African music star Molemo â€œJub Jubâ€ �
Maarohanye has just received a 10-year sentence after being found guilty of culpable homicide for killing four schoolchildren while drag racing .
Pistorius could receive a suspended sentence .
If it is wholly suspended , this would see the athlete walk free , and stay free bar any misdemeanours .
If it is part suspended , he would still go to prison for a period .
Pistorius could receive a non - custodial sentence .
In this scenario he would not do any jail time , but might be placed under a form of house arrest , made to report regularly to a police station , and/or undertake community service .
Pistorius could receive a fine .
In 2013 , a former footballer for South Africaâ€ ™ s national team , Bryce Moon , was fined R60 000 ( around Â£3356 ) following his conviction for culpable homicide for having knocked down and killed Zimbabwean domestic worker Mavis Ncube in his car .
Viasen Soobramoneyâ€ ™ s report gives more detail as to what these scenarios might entail here .
Welcome to the Guardianâ€ ™ s live coverage of the sentencing of athlete Oscar Pistorius , who was found guilty of culpable homicide in South Africa last month .
The North Gauteng high court in Pretoria will shortly reconvene to begin hearing arguments from the defence and the prosecution to determine the penalty Pistorius will receive for the shooting of his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , on 14 February 2013
In September , Judge Thokozile Masipa cleared Pistorius of murder but convicted him on the lesser charge of culpable homicide , akin to manslaughter in British law .
She also found him guilty on one charge of having negligently discharged a firearm in a crowded restaurant in Johannesburg in January 2013 .
In finding Pistorius guilty of culpable homicide , Judge Masipa said that by firing four shots through a locked toilet door , Pistorius had acted â€œtoo hastily and used excessive force .
In the circumstances , it is clear his conduct was negligent.â€ �
She added that his actions had not been those of a â€œreasonable manâ€ � .
However , she found that Pistoriusâ€ ™ s version of events â€ “ that he had mistaken Steenkamp for an intruder â€ “ could â€œreasonably , possiblyâ€ � be true .
There has been just over a monthâ€ ™ s break between the delivery of the verdict and the beginning of the sentencing hearing today .
During this time Pistorius has been keeping out of the spotlight at his uncle Arnold Pistoriusâ€ ™ s house in Pretoria , after the prosecutionâ€ ™ s attempt to have his bail revoked failed .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s David Smith is in court in Pretoria .
Follow him on Twitter for updates and breaking news - @SmithInAfrica â€ “ and read his report on the â€œtrial that had everythingâ€ � here ."
2014-10-14,"Oscar Pistorius is a â€œbroken manâ€ � who should be spared prison and allowed to resume his sporting career , a court heard on Monday , as the Paralympianâ€ ™ s epic trial entered its final chapter .
Pistorius , who was last month cleared of murder but convicted of the culpable homicide of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp , is a suitable candidate for three years of house arrest and community service , a state social worker testified at his sentencing hearing .
The recommendation , which could enable the double amputee athlete to compete in the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics in Rio , was derided by state prosecutor Gerrie Nel as â€œshockingly inappropriateâ€ � and triggered an avalanche of criticism on social media .
Pistorius , 27 , has always maintained that he mistook Steenkamp , a 29-year - old law graduate and model , for an intruder when he shot four times through a locked toilet door at his home on Valentineâ€ ™ s day last year .
Judge Thokozile Masipa last month accepted his version of events but found his actions negligent .
She was widely criticised for the verdict and on Monday was protected by heightened security at the high court in Pretoria , where she began hearing arguments from the prosecution , the defence and psychological and probation experts before pronouncing sentence .
Joel Maringa , a social worker for the correctional services department , told the court that convictions for culpable homicide often do not result in a jail term .
Pistorius , sitting in the dock , looked down at his notes and appeared emotional as the expert witness continued .
â€œThe accused is a first offender , â€ � Maringa said .
â€œThe traumatic encounter being responsible for the negligent loss of the life of his companion has already subjected him to punishment .
His offending behaviour could be successfully modified within the community context .
His potential in sports could best be unleashed within the community context for his ultimate financial upkeep.â€
�
He said Pistorius was a cooperative person who should be sentenced to three years of correctional supervision , meaning that he would have to spend part of the day at home .
This would give him an opportunity to restructure and modify his behaviour , Maringa added .
â€œWe are basically not saying that he should be destroyed because he will still be coming back into the community.â€ �
Maringa said Pistorius should carry out 16 hours of community service a month â€ “ two days of eight hours each , which would involve cleaning a local hospital and museum .
This would allow him to train and compete in athletics meetings again .
But Nel , urging a lengthy prison sentence , said Maringaâ€ ™ s suggestions would amount to â€œno sentenceâ€ � .
In the public gallery Steenkampâ€ ™ s father , Barry , held his head in his hands as Maringa testified , while her friends shook their heads in consternation .
A murder conviction would have carried a jail sentence .
Culpable homicide , South Africaâ€ ™ s equivalent of manslaughter , can be punished by anything from 15 years in jail to a suspended sentence or community service .
The state could decide to appeal against the culpable homicide verdict in pursuit of a murder conviction .
Earlier , the court heard from Pistoriusâ€ ™ s
psychologist , Dr Lore Hartzenberg , who said she began counselling him soon after the killing and found him in â€œan unresolved spiral of griefâ€ � .
Hartzenberg said the sprinter had sometimes cried , retched , perspired and paced up and down during sessions in which she tried to assist him .
â€œSome of the sessions were just him weeping and crying and me holding him , â€ �
she said .
â€œHis opportunity for healing was destroyed by the malevolent media reports and public comments â€ ¦
Mr Pistorius experienced himself as utterly worthless.â€ � Hartzenberg described the athlete as a caring , remorseful person who was suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder .
â€œWe are left with a broken man who has lost everything , â€ �
she said .
â€œHe has lost his love relationship with Miss Steenkamp .
He has lost his moral and professional reputation .
He has lost friends .
He has lost his career and therefore his earning potential and also his financial independence .
On an emotional level , his self - perception , his self - worth and identity have been damaged to the extent that he is unlikely to fully recover from the consequences of the shooting incident that occurred on 14 February 2013.â€
�
Hartzenburg told the court that Pistorius would never escape images from the night of the incident .
â€œThe flashbacks and the re - experiencing of the shooting will be mental images that he will carry with him , â€ �
she said .
â€œ[They ] will be part of his life until such time that healing has taken place.â€ � Nel criticised her findings , saying Pistorius would still have the chance to fall in love again and rebuild his life and possibly continue his career .
â€œWe are now dealing with a broken man , but he is still alive , â€ � the prosecutor said .
He asked the psychologist if she had read media reports that Pistorius already had a new girlfriend and questioned what she knew about Steenkamp and the impact on her family .
â€œDo
you know anything about her dreams , what she wanted to do in
life?â€ �
ater Pistoriusâ€ ™ s agent and manager , Peet van Zyl , told the court about the sprinterâ€ ™ s charity work that earned thanks from Lord Coe and invitations from former footballer Sir Bobby Charlton , tennis player Novak Djokovic and a charity for British war veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq .
Pistorius was due to launch his own charitable foundation in July 2013 after working with the University of Strathclyde in Glasgowto develop prosthetic limbs for children in Africa .
He was also poised to sign new sponsorship deals and acquire shares in a company at the time of the tragedy .
â€œI can categorically state at this point in time all contracts have been officially terminated , â€ � van Zyl said .

2014-10-15,"David Smith has filed this report from court in Pretoria today .
That 's it for today 's coverage ; the live blog will be back on Thursday morning when the court resumes .
Thank you for reading .
The Guardian video team has put together this clip of Kim Martinâ€ ™ s powerful testimony today : A day that began with wrangles over money and prison conditions ended on a highly emotional note as Kim Martin , a cousin of Reeva Steenkamp , took to the stand to be â€œReevaâ€ ™ s voiceâ€
� in describing how the loss has affected her family , after the victimâ€ ™ s parents , June and Barry Steenkamp , decided they could not give testimony themselves .
The court adjourned early today before Martin tomorrow faces what will surely be a gentle cross - examination by Barry Roux for the defence .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel has assured the judge that he intends to wrap up his questions for his â€œthree or fourâ€ � witnesses by Thursday afternoon , which â€ “ given the judgeâ€ ™ s other commitments in coming weeks
â€ “ would strongly indicate that we will hear the sentence on Friday .
Hereâ€ ™ s a recap of todayâ€ ™ s key developments : Kim Martin , the first cousin of Reeva Steenkamp , broke down as she told the court she had heard the news of the shooting on the radio while driving to work on 14 February 2013 : Then [ the radio DJ ] said : â€˜Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ â€ ¦ and the minute he said his name
I jumped in the front seat
and I froze .
And the next words were : â€˜allegedly shot his girlfriendâ€ ™ .
And I said to my husband , â€˜I hope
to god heâ€ ™ s cheating on Reeva.â€ ™
In moving testimony , Martin told the court about the life of Reeva Steenkamp , who she said was a hard worker , a fun - loving and nurturing person , who supported her parents financially .
She said the loss of her cousin had â€˜ruined our whole familyâ€ ™ .
After breaking her back in a horse - riding accident after studying for a law degree , Steenkamp had pursued a modelling career because â€˜life can be over so quicklyâ€ ™ .
Lawyers for June and Barry Steenkamp , parents of Reeva Steenkamp , have clarified details of the payments made to them by Oscar Pistorius since their daughter was killed last year .
They say the R6000 monthly payments will be repaid and the Steenkamps will not pursue a civil claim against the athlete .
Barry Roux , for Pistorius , told the court that his client did not want the money back and had given it â€œwithout conditionsâ€ � .
Nel has vigorously sought to undermine the picture painted by defence witnesses of a violent , overcrowded prison system in which Pistoriusâ€ ™ s disabilities would not be catered for .
There was not â€œthe slightest possibilityâ€ � that Pistoriusâ€ ™ s prostheses would be confiscated , he told the court .
The Department of Correctional Services has issued a statement calling the defence claims â€œinaccurateâ€ � .
In cross - examination of the final defence witness , state prosecutor Gerrie Nel savaged claims by probation officer Annette Vergeer that South African jails would not be a suitable place for Pistorius .
The facilities in prison would be the same if Pistorius had been convicted of murder , Nel said : would Vergeer even then have recommended he should not go to jail ?
Nel warned that if the sentence imposed was too light , the public could be encouraged to take matters into their own hands .
There was an awkward exchange as Nel and Vergeer discussed the merits of the availability of condoms in prison , with Nel accusing the witness of discriminating against consensual sex between male inmates , and both avoiding mention of rape .
South Africaâ€ ™ s two high - profile court cases collided , as Nel citedthe ongoing murder trial of Shrien Dewani , who was extradited from the UK to South Africa after the court in London agreed that jail conditions would be acceptable , as proof that Pistoriusâ€ ™ s vulnerabilities should not spare him a prison sentence .
June Steenkamp has left court .
Her niece Kim Martin told the judge today that her uncle and aunt â€ “ Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents â€ “ could not testify in person because they feared they would â€œlose itâ€
� on the stand .
The Department of Correctional Services in South Africa has issued this statement to the media following exchanges in court about conditions in its jails : The Department of Correctional Services has noted with concern inaccurate serious allegations that sought to cast doubt on the state of our correctional centres .
The allegations from media reports emanate from the Oscar Pistorius trial that is underway at the North Gauteng high court .
The reports seek to create an impression that our centres are fraught with , amongst other things , unhygienic conditions , gang violence and sodomy or rape .
In as much as our department respects the sub judice rule that applies to court proceedings that have not yet been finalised , the image of our correctional centres , our department and the government in general is at stake .
We , therefore , deem it appropriate that we register our concern in this regard .
Out of respect for the sub judice rule , we will not comment further on the evidence as reported in the media ; save to say that such allegations about the conditions in our centres are inaccurate .
We are prepared to make our expert officials available to the court on issues relating to the conditions in our correctional centres as and when required to do so .
It is likely that Gerrie Nel will call on someone to testify to conditions in jails following claims by defence witnesses about the potentially injurious effects on Pistorius of a custodial sentence .
AFP has filed this report on the testimony of Kim Martin this afternoon : Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s cousin tearfully remembered an idyllic childhood spent with the law graduate and model , painfully recalling â€˜the end of the worldâ€ ™ when Oscar Pistorius shot her dead .
Kim Martin told the South African judge â€ “ now weighing Pistoriusâ€ ™ s punishment for unlawfully killing Steenkamp â€ “ of a caring and â€˜fun - loving childâ€ ™ .
Martin recalled how Reeva was the first baby she ever held , and of a joyful childhood filled with horse - riding and caring for injured animals .
Martin said the young Steenkamp once cared for a paralysed poodle named Jade , who she carried around , serving as its â€˜legsâ€ ™ .
As Martin recounted her cherished memories , Steenkampâ€ ™ s father Barry broke down in court , his shoulders shaking .
Pistorius sat in the dock , also wiping away tears .
Through her good marks at school Steenkamp got a bursary , Martin said , in testimony designed to underscore the severity of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s crime .
â€˜Aunty June was very strict , Reeva wasnâ€ ™ t allowed boyfriends , â€ ™ said Martin , adding that Steenkamp later became involved in an emotionally abusive relationship before she met Pistorius .
Martin said Steenkamp gave her very first pay cheque from modelling to her parents â€ “ who always struggled financially â€ “ to pay for her schooling .
Martin recalled driving to work and listening to the radio on Valentineâ€ ™ s day 2013 , the day Steenkamp died .
When the announcer said that Oscar Pistorius shot his girlfriend , Martin remembered thinking : â€˜I hope to God he is cheating on Reeva.â€ ™
When Martin saw her distraught mother she knew it was Reeva .
â€˜For me it was the end of the world.â€ ™ Asked why she was testifying , Martin fought through the tears : â€˜I must be Reevaâ€ ™ s voice .
I had to do this for Reeva
, I owe it to her.â€ ™ Nel asks for the court to stop for today and resume in the morning .
He says the witness is too emotional to be cross - examined today .
Roux says he doesnâ€ ™ t intend to cross - examine Martin .
He wants to ask her two short questions .
He thinks Nel should finish so that Martin doesnâ€ ™ t need to come back tomorrow .
Nel says he wants the extra time to consult with Martin first .
The judge says she will allow the break now , but reminds the court she is only available this week , and not for the following several weeks .
Nel says he is sure he will be finished with evidence by Thursday afternoon .
Court proceedings end for today .
I will post a summary of todayâ€ ™ s developments shortly .
Martin says they drove to the beach , which was very crowded , and found a table at a restaurant but â€œeverything went wrongâ€ � with their order .
Pistorius was agitated , she says ; â€œhe was obviously not used to Cape Town service!â€ �
But she says she remembers thinking he was a very nice person .
She did not notice much affection between the couple .
Pistorius left the table to take a call and Martin asked her cousin if she was happy .
Steenkamp replied : â€œYes , but we need to talk.â€ �
But Pistorius came back and Martin says she never had a chance to quiz Steenkamp further .
That has bothered me for ever since then â€ ¦
What did she mean ?
Martin is back to her meeting with Pistorius .
She says she was excited and â€œa bit nervous to meet this famous personâ€ � .
I remember thinking , heâ€
™ s just standing there â€ ¦
He came across quite shy .
Nel asks about a period Steenkamp spent living with the Myers family ( some of whom are in court today ) after she broke up with a previous boyfriend : Martin says she met Pistorius once , with Steenkamp , on 2 January 2013 ( a month before she was killed ) .
Steenkamp invited her cousin for coffee in Cape Town ; she and Pistorius were flying down for a couple of days .
The previous Christmas had been the first she did not spend with her parents , Martin says , â€œdue to workâ€ � .
Nel points out that she did not spend it with Pistorius either .
Nel turns to Steenkampâ€ ™ s work for abused women .
Martin talks about the work she did for womenâ€ ™ s rights : Her thing was she wanted to stop girls allowing themselves to be in those [ abusive ] situations .
Her modelling career was also going from strength to strength , Martin says , and she was chosen to be the â€œface of Avonâ€ � and was on the cover of FHM .
She was â€œextremely excitedâ€
� when she was cast for the TV reality show Tropica .
Martin says she did not want to be here today
but she had to be , to be Reevaâ€ ™ s voice .
She felt she owed it to her cousin .
She is missing her daughterâ€ ™ s exam today , but her daughter understands why she needed to be in court .
Martin says she spoke to her uncle and aunt last night about giving evidence today .
She wanted to know that they would be comfortable with her talking about them .
She did not want to disappoint them .
They told her she had their blessing , and that she should be Reevaâ€ ™ s voice .
Barry Steenkamp told her he would love to take the stand but that he could not .
â€œHe would just lose it.â€
�
Martin says she herself is on medication for depression and anxiety .
Her children are receiving therapy .
Her daughter has spent two weeks in an institution to help her cope ; she and Reeva were very close .
Pistorius is bent over in the dock , his head in his hand , as Martin tells the court how her uncleâ€ ™ s health has suffered since Steenkamp was killed : he has had a couple of strokes .
June Steenkamp has suffered a lot of stress .
Martin says June and Barry Steenkamp are strong and dignified people .
No one wanted to arrange the funeral , Martin says .
Nel asks how June and Barry Steenkamp reacted .
Martin says her aunt was hysterical , she was medicated .
Her uncle sat in the corner , â€œcrying , crying , cryingâ€ � .
Itâ€ ™ s terrible .
Itâ€ ™ s ruined our whole family
â€ ¦
Reeva was everything to them .
She looked after them so well
â€
¦
I didnâ€
™ t think theyâ€ ™ d be able to cope knowing that Reeva wasnâ€ ™ t there .
It was the worst experience I have ever , ever been through , Martin tells the court .
She says she did not know how to face her uncle and aunt ( Barry Steenkamp , in the court room , has covered his face ) .
Kim Martin is still on the stand .
Nel is asking her about hearing the news on the radio that Pistorius had shot his girlfriend .
It was not confirmed at that point that it was Reeva Steenkamp , she says .
Martin says she tried over and over to ring Steenkamp , but she wasnâ€ ™ t answering .
She started to scream .
She got to her motherâ€ ™ s house ; the door was open and her mother was hysterical .
And then I knew it was true .
It was for me the end of the world .
Martin is crying .
Nel asks Martin about the day Reeva Steenkamp was shot .
She and her husband were driving to work and the radio came on with breaking news .
Then he said :
Oscar Pistorius â€ ¦ and the minute
he said his name
I jumped in the front seat
and I froze .
And the next words were : has shot his girlfriend .
And I said to my husband , I hope to god heâ€
™ s cheating on Reeva .
Kim Martin is very upset at this point .
Judge Masipa tells her the court will take a break from what must be intensely upsetting testimony for her .
Martin is now talking about her uncle and aunt , Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents : The cat later escaped from Martinâ€ ™ s care : When she eventually told Steenkamp , Martin recalls , her cousin told her she thought she was being punished for her break - up with Warren and that her life was out of control .
The cat came back about six weeks later .
Steenkamp found the break - up â€ “ combined with problems with her fatherâ€ ™ s health ; he had diabetes â€ “ very traumatic , Martin tells the court .
She told her cousin it was like a divorce .
Martin mentions a relationship Steenkamp had with a man called Warren : â€œShe couldnâ€ ™ t have found a nicer guy.â€
�
But he was a workaholic and Steenkamp was ready to have children , Martin adds .
The relationship came to an end .
Martin says Steenkamp sent money to her parents and covered their medical insurance .
Steenkamp came to live with Martin and her family in Cape Town for a while .
Martin says her daughters â€œadoredâ€ � Reeva , who ended up staying for around six months .
Martin is talking through Steenkampâ€ ™ s early career as a model .
She says her cousin was extremely happy , having fun , working hard and earning money .
Family was very important to Steenkamp , Martin says .
She loved family gatherings .
Reeva Steenkamp had a horse - riding accident as a young woman in which she broke her back and was in traction .
That made her take stock of her life , Nel asks .
Martin agrees : Steenkamp decided she would finish her law degree but she would also pursue modelling because â€œlife can be over so quicklyâ€ � .
Steenkamp also wanted to support her parents financially , Martin says ; she gave them her first pay cheque .
Martin says Steenkamp was , like her parents , a hard worker , who was always keen to get to school , an all - girls convent school in Port Elizabeth .
She earned a bursary to study law and gained her LLB .
She says June Steenkamp was strict about relationships and Reeva only later began to have boyfriends .
Her first relationship was with a jockey , who was â€œvery emotionally abusiveâ€ � .
Martin is giving very moving testimony about Reeva Steenkamp and how she is missed by her family : Martin says the Steenkamp family had to work very hard to keep their farm going , and struggled financially .
Martin :
Reeva was the first baby I had ever held â€
¦
I was 12 years old at the time
â€
¦ I was so nervous and scared that I would drop her .
Aunty June gave her to me and I held her in my arms and she didnâ€ ™ t even cry â€
¦
There was a very strong bond from a very young age .
Reeva was a very fun - loving child
â€
¦
She was always like the little Pied Piper : we would follow her around â€
¦
She would always look after everybody , even the adults .
Reeva from a young age stood out .
There was just something about her .
Martin says the two families â€œspent all our time togetherâ€ � .
She refers to Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents as Uncle Barry and Aunty June .
Kim Martin says she is the first and oldest cousin of Reeva Steenkamp , 12 years Reevaâ€ ™ s senior .
Their fathers are brothers .
Nel runs through the family connections , mentioning other siblings and cousins .
Martin reveals that June Steenkampâ€ ™ s oldest daughter , Simone , has moved back from the UK after Reeva was killed .
Gerrie Nel calls his first witness : Kim Martin , Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s cousin .
He asks that she not be televised , although we will hear her voice .
The Guardian video team has put together this clip from this morningâ€ ™ s proceedings , in which Gerrie Nel rebuts Annette Vergeerâ€ ™ s opinion that prison may be inappropriate for the athlete because of his disability , accusing her of providing misinformation : There are several people present in court today who â€ “ reporters in Pretoria are suggesting â€ “ could potentially be called as witnesses for the state .
Businessman Jared Mortimer was the man with whom Pistorius was involved in an altercation at a nightclub over the summer .
Mortimer has claimed Pistorius was drunk .
Patricia Taylor , mother of Samantha Taylor , an ex - girlfriend of Pistorius , recently published a book â€ “ Oscar :
An Accident Waiting To Happen â€
“ in which she claimed the athlete was a deeply troubled and volatile young man who had to be coaxed out of anxious tears to collect a medal at the 2012 Paralympic Games .
The court has taken an early lunch break while Gerrie Nel prepares to call the stateâ€ ™ s witnesses .
Heâ€
™ s told the judge he intends to call three or four witnesses , with one certain to be a representative of the correctional services
â€ “ Nel has vigorously sought to undermine the picture painted by defence witnesses of a violent , overcrowded prison system in which Pistoriusâ€ ™ s disabilities would not be catered for .
Hereâ€ ™ s a rundown of
this morningâ€ ™ s key developments : Lawyers for June and Barry Steenkamp , parents of Reeva Steenkamp , have clarified details of the payments made to them by Oscar Pistorius since their daughter was killed last year .
They say the R6000 monthly payments will be repaid and the Steenkamps will not pursue a civil claim against the athlete .
Barry Roux , for Pistorius , told the court that his client did not want the money back and had given it â€œwithout conditionsâ€ � .
In cross - examination of the final defence witness , state prosecutor Gerrie Nel savaged claims by probation officer Annette Vergeer that South African jails would not be a suitable place for Pistorius .
The facilities in prison would be the same if Pistorius had been convicted of murder , Nel said : would Vergeer even then have recommended he should not go to jail ?
Vergeer conceded she had not seen the cells in her prison visit , but only the visiting areas .
Nel warned that if the sentence imposed was too light , the public could be encouraged to take matters into their own hands .
There was an awkward exchange as Nel and Vergeer discussed the merits of the availability of condoms in prison , with Nel accusing the witness of discriminating against consensual sex between male inmates , and both avoiding mention of rape .
South Africaâ€ ™ s two high - profile court cases collided , as Nel cited the ongoing murder trial of Shrien Dewani , who was extradited from the UK to South Africa after the court in London agreed that jail conditions would be acceptable , as proof that Pistoriusâ€ ™ s vulnerabilities should not spare him a prison sentence .
And some key quotes from Nel : The court can do him a favour by sentencing him to prison â€ ¦ because
itâ€ ™ s free .
He would not have to pay for psychological treatment in the prison .
Should people be deterred from firing four shots through a locked door in the middle of the night ?
â€
¦
Thatâ€ ™ s
what weâ€ ™ re dealing with .
You say heâ€ ™ s a broken person .
Heâ€ ™ s a broken person because of what he did .
We have to weigh that up against a broken family .
The court hearing will resume at 1.30pm South Africa time ( 12.30pm BST ) .
Nel says he needs some time to consult with his first witness .
He says he will call â€œat most three or fourâ€ � witnesses .
He says he wonâ€ ™ t be long with his witnesses â€ “
I wonâ€
™ t take you at your word for that , says Judge Masipa , laughing .
Nel asks for a one - and - a - half - hour adjournment to prepare .
The court will be back at 1.30pm South Africa time ( 12.30pm BST ) .
I will post a summary of the morningâ€ ™ s proceedings shortly .
When Pistorius sold his car , the defence team offered to pay the money into a trust account in case the Steenkamps later decided to accept the payment , Roux says .
But the Steenkamps declined .
Roux reads the statement to the court .
He breaks off to add that Pistorius made the monthly payments of R6000 ( approximately Â£340/US$540 ) without conditions and he does not want it back , though he says it is up to the Steenkamps if they wish to repay it .
Roux has called all his witnesses but wants to deal with the statement of June and Barry Steenkamp , released this morning , about the payments made to them by Pistorius .
You can read it here .
Roux wants it to be read into the court record .
Nel moves on : has the witness followed the Dewani case ?
( Shrien Dewani is currently on trial for the murder of his wife Anni on their South African honeymoon ; you can read about it here . )
Nel points out that in extraditing Dewani , the UK court agreed that South African prison conditions were acceptable .
With that , Nelâ€ ™ s cross - examination is over .
Barry Roux , for the defence , asks Vergeer if she knows whether Dewani is being held in a South African prison .
She says she doesnâ€ ™ t know .
( Dewani is being held in Valkenberg psychiatric hospital , a high - security psychiatric hospital in the Western Cape . )
Why is it a negative thing that condoms are available in prison , Nel asks Vergeer : are you discriminating against consensual sex ?
She denies this , but asks : why would it be a positive factor ?
It is an all - male prison .
Nel says the witness is biased against prisons .
You donâ€
™ t want to send Pistorius to prison , based on â€œsweeping statementsâ€ � about facilities in jail , Nel puts to Vergeer .
She disagrees : she isnâ€ ™ t responsible for sending or not sending anyone to prison ; sheâ€ ™ s just here to give an opinion .
Vergeer agrees Pistorius is not a victim , but says he is not made of stone : he has emotions .
Nel :
You say heâ€ ™ s a broken person .
Heâ€ ™ s a broken person because of what he did .
We have to weigh that up against a broken family .
Pistorius is not a victim , Nel tells the court .
This witness has not had an easy morning : Nel has comprehensively taken apart her report to the court recommending that Pistorius should be sentenced to house arrest and community service :
Day 46 of the hearing â€ “ and the third day of sentencing â€ “ resumes .
Probation officer Annette Vergeer is still on the stand for her cross - examination .
( The delay was apparently caused by a problem with the court recording machine , now resolved . )
Gerrie Nel indicated before the break that he expected his cross - examination of the final defence witness to be finished swiftly .
This means we would then move on to the stateâ€ ™ s own witnesses .
It is likely there will be three , one of which looks certain to be a representative of the prison service , who will presumably vouch for the safety of Pistorius should he be jailed .
It looks less likely that June or Barry Steenkamp will take the stand , though some commentators in South Africa have suggested a friend of Reeva Steenkamp â€ “ perhaps Gina Myers â€ “ might do so .
We are still waiting for the court to resume ;
itâ€ ™ s past the 15 minutes allotted for the tea break but itâ€ ™ s usual for these breaks to run late .
Reporters in court in Pretoria say that Pistoriusâ€ ™ s uncle Arnold was seen talking with Barry Steenkamp , father of Reeva , and the Steenkampsâ€ ™ lawyer , Dup de Bruyn , during the break .
Arnold Pistorius and Barry Steenkamp are reported to have hugged .
Nel asks for a tea break .
He says he wonâ€ ™ t be too much longer with this witness afterwards .
Court adjourns for 15 minutes .
So because he will have to walk on concrete floors and there are no shower rails , Pistorius should not be sent to prison , Nel asks Vergeer .
If he has his prosthetic legs , he can walk : why should he be treated differently from other accused ?
Vergeer says Pistorius could be pushed over , especially if floors are slippery .
Nel says he is concerned : is she saying that â€ “ whatever he does â€ “
he should never be sent to prison , because of the facilities ?
Even if he had been convicted of murder ?
The facilities would have been the same .
Nel :
For community service to be effective , a person must be taken out of his comfort zone and not just do what heâ€
™ s been doing all along ?
The suggestion that Pistorius should work with disabled children would hardly be out of his comfort zone , Nel suggests .
Vergeer says he could perhaps do voluntary work at a police station or museum instead .
Nel wants to know if Vergeer thinks society would be happy for Pistorius to get three years of house arrest , doing community service for a handful of days a month .
Vergeer says it is not about the opinion of society ; the punishment should be about justice and serving a purpose .
Nel says that if society is not satisfied that justice has been done , that is when people take matters into their own hands .
Sixteen hours a month of community service is â€œshockingly inappropriateâ€ � , he tells the court .
Nel wants to know if Pistorius would be able to train and pursue an athletics career under correctional supervision ; Vergeer confirms he would .
Nel brings up the case of Molemo â€œJub
Jubâ€ � Maarohanye , originally convicted of murder for causing the deaths of four children while drag - racing ; his conviction was recently altered to culpable homicide â€ “ the same charge on which Pistorius has been found guilty â€ “ and given a sentence of 10 years in prison .
People do go to prison for culpable homicide , Nel points out , citing another case in which a school bus driver crashed into a train .
Donâ€ ™ t you think society would want a heavy punishment for the â€œhorribleâ€ � death of Reeva Steenkamp , Nel asks .
Vergeer says it is not for society , but the court , to decide punishment .
Nel :
Society demands that if you kill someone , there should be a harsh punishment .
Vergeer :
I canâ€ ™ t dispute
that â€
¦
But we have to look at circumstances .
Vergeer continues to insist that Pistorius would not be able to carry on with his current psychological treatment if he is jailed .
So anyone who is receiving treatment before he is convicted canâ€ ™ t be sent to prison , Nel asks her .
Another accused could pay for continuing treatment , Vergeer says : Pistorius might not have the funds .
What if another accused did not have the funds , Nel asks her .
Nel :
Then the court can do him a favour by sentencing him to prison â€ ¦ because itâ€ ™ s free .
He would not have to pay for psychological treatment in the prison .
Nel concedes that not all South African prisons are â€œthe best places in the worldâ€ � .
But he is taking issue with Vergeerâ€ ™ s characterisation of them .
Prisoners are looked after , he says .
Nel finds more quibbles with Vergeerâ€ ™ s assessment of the prison system : doesnâ€ ™ t she know that psychological services must be available to all inmates , he asks .
The witness is biting back on this one : you have to be realistic , she says â€ “
the quality of the service might not be enough for someone with Pistoriusâ€ ™ s issues .
There arenâ€ ™ t sufficient psychologists available .
Weâ€ ™ ve moved back to the issue of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s disability and the vulnerabilities Vergeer says would be exacerbated by a prison sentence .
Do you have any statistics about disabled prisoners , Nel asks .
She does not .
Nel tells her there are , on average , 128 disabled people yearly entering prisons in South Africa .
Prisons have been catering for disabled prisoners for 10 years .
Vergeer says she â€œwill have to take note of thatâ€ � .
Nel swerves to a separate case in which Vergeer was an expert witness : the so - called Sunday rapist .
( Johannes Jacobus Steyn was sentenced to five life terms in prison in 2012 for charges including murder , rape and kidnap . )
Vergeer was the probation officer for Steyn when he was convicted of indecent assault .
He was receiving therapy and expressed remorse , she says , and she recommended correctional supervision â€ “ that is , not a prison term .
Nel :
You had the view that he would not reoffend â€ ¦
he offended immediately thereafter .
Judge Masipa intervenes :
it is the likelihood of reoffending that the court has to deal with , she says .
It is not a certainty .
Nel says he is not accusing the witness of anything .
Nel :
You say the accused accepts he was negligent .
What negligence does he accept ?
Vergeer :
That he fired the shots and a person was killed .
Nel :
How do you know he accepts he was negligent ?
Vergeer :
He said to me he fired the shots that killed the deceased .
Nel is pushing Vergeer on the circumstances of Steenkampâ€ ™ s death : did Pistorius tell her he intended to shoot through the door ?
Was it an accident , did the gun discharge by itself ?
He was in shock , Vergeer tells the court ; she canâ€
™ t remember whether he told her he intended to shoot .
The witness says the court has already heard Pistoriusâ€ ™ s own version .
But Nel tells her he wants to know what Pistorius told her .
Vergeer sticks resolutely to the judgment of the court .
Nel :
Should people be deterred from firing four shots through a locked door in the middle of the night ?
â€
¦
Thatâ€ ™ s
what weâ€ ™ re dealing with .
You are using a pro forma , Nel tells Vergeer : your report is a copy - and - paste number .
Vergeer says all reports must conform to a certain standard : Nel seems to be done on this point .
He moves on to a new argument : the deterrence element of a sentence .
What should other potential offenders be deterred from by this case , he asks .
Vergeer says she would start with the firearm offence .
No , says Nel :
letâ€ ™ s start with the culpable homicide .
The witness says she would want others to think before committing an offence .
Nel now wants to know from Vergeer what Pistorius could do if , when imprisoned , his prostheses were taken and he wanted to complain .
The witness says she knows there are avenues for complaint , but she doesnâ€ ™ t know what they are .
Vergeer says she will make note of that .
Nel is incredulous at what he is increasingly effectively painting as her paucity of knowledge of current conditions in South Africaâ€ ™ s jails .
She also did not know that judges and magistrates can visit prisons to check on them .
Nel is still prodding Vergeer on the issue of the baths .
Who told her there were none , he wants to know ?
The witness
canâ€ ™ t say , but admits her report states there are no baths .
This is based on one example , she concedes : Nel : In a specific section in a specific facility , and you have elevated that to all prisons in South Africa ?
Vergeer confirms she has not actually been inside the Pretoria prison , but only the visiting areas .
There are single cells and baths for disabled prisoners , Nel tells her : yesterday , she told the court that Pistorius should not be jailed because there were no baths and he would be vulnerable without prostheses in the showers .
Vergeer says she saw no baths in a visit she made to a different prison two years ago .
Nel says he finds Vergeer â€œso , so irresponsibleâ€ � to come to court to testify without being fully informed about the prison system she is talking about .
There are people in wheelchairs in prisons , he says .
And he intends to call a witness who will vouch that there is not â€œthe slightest possibilityâ€ � that Pistoriusâ€ ™ s prostheses will be confiscated .
Vergeer is facing intense pressure from Nel , and admits she can not verify the position of the person she spoke to on the phone from Pretoria prison : Nel establishes that Vergeer is not familiar with the Correctional Services Act .
He is surprised that she would come to testify without being aware of its details : Isnâ€ ™ t she aware that no medical devices can be removed from a prisoner without permission of a doctor , Nel asks ?
( Yesterday , Vergeer said Pistoriusâ€ ™ s prosthetic legs would likely be taken from him in prison . )
Nel :
You should know everything about prisons because youâ€ ™ ve been commenting on prisons â€ ¦ and you donâ€ ™ t .
You donâ€
™ t know the Department of Correctional Services have a policy on disability ?
You never thought of just asking them ?
Nel is probing Vergeerâ€ ™ s research on the conditions in South African prisons â€ “ which yesterday she said were violent and overcrowded , with drugs , gangs , sodomy and Aids an everyday reality .
The prosecutor queries whether any of her facts date from more recently than 2008 .
His implication is that conditions have improved since that time .
This is the website Vergeer cited yesterday , about the management of South African jail .
Nel points out this site is a speech made by the general secretary of a union nine years ago .
Nel asks Vergeer if she is employed as a state official ; she confirms she is , but has permission to work privately for the defence team .
As a state official , she could have requested additional information from other state departments , Nel says .
Vergeer agrees , adding that she did so : a welfare officer at Pretoria prison .
Probation officer Annette Vergeer is still on the stand and prosecutor Gerrie Nel is straight back into his cross - examination .
Oscar Pistorius is already in the court room , along with his brother and sister , Carl and Aimee .
Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents , June and Barry , are also there .
The judge is expected to arrive very shortly .
There was surprise in court on Tuesday as Vergeer disclosed that Pistorius has been making monthly payments to Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents , June and Barry Steenkamp .
Nel said : â€œThose monies will be paid back to the accused in full , every cent.â€ �
My colleague David Smith reports : After the hearing , the Steenkampsâ€ ™ lawyer , Dup de Bruyn , explained that the payments had begun in March 2013 , a month after the law graduate and modelâ€ ™ s death .
â€˜When Reeva passed away , they [ the Steenkamp family ] were in financial straits , â€ ™ he said .
â€˜I conveyed this to Mr Pistoriusâ€ ™ s lawyer .
He came back with an offer of 6,000 [ rand ; approximately Â£340/US$540 ] a month for 18 months .
When he started paying , we only thought it fair to make that public , but the request was from Oscar through his lawyers to keep it confidential .
We honoured that request.â€ ™ Asked why they had accepted the payments , De Bruyn replied : â€˜They needed it.â€ ™
But the payments have now stopped and will be repaid , he added , and they turned down the one - off sum [ of R375,000 ] .
â€˜The offer has been made and rejected .
The Steenkamps donâ€ ™ t want any money and there will be no civil case .
They want closure.â€ ™
It looks likely , however , that the issue will rear its head in court again today : And the Steenkampsâ€ ™ legal team has this morning issued a fresh statement : Certain disclosures in court yesterday have made it necessary to issue this statement â€
¦
We have advised the parents to remain neutral in regard to sentence in the sense that they should not be seen to attempt to influence the sentence in any way .
After Miss Steenkamp ( the deceased ) was killed on 13 February 2013 , the parents were in financial difficulties .
This was mentioned to Mr Pistoriusâ€ ™ s lawyers
â€
¦
We were contacted soon afterwards by Mr Pistoriusâ€
™ s
lawyers with an offer that Mr Pistorius would contribute an amount of R6000 per month towards the parentsâ€ ™ rental and living expenses .
Payments took place from March 2013 until September 2014 â€ ¦
The request of Mr Pistorius , conveyed through his lawyers was that the matter be kept confidential .
We have honoured this request .
We were therefore quite surprised yesterday when this fact was disclosed in court without any prior warning to us .
The fact that the matter had been kept confidential at the request of Mr Pistoriusâ€ ™ s legal advisers , has also not been placed on record .
It was always the intention of the parents that the amounts of R6000 would be setâ€“off against any civil claim that they were going to institute .
However once they had decided not to proceed with the civil claim , which decision was only taken during the past few weeks , it follows that the money will be repaid .
The Steenkamp lawyers also say that they approached the Pistorius team to discuss a possible financial settlement , but insist June and Barry Steenkamp were not aware of this : When the parents were made aware of this offer , they considered it carefully but decided , for various reasons , that they did not want any payment from Mr Pistorius .
This is also why we were instructed to advise that no civil claim would be instituted .
We place this on record to make it clear that a request for an offer emanated from our side , and not from Mr Pistoriusâ€ ™ s side .
He was responding to our request as to whether the civil claim could not be settled .
We agreed with Mr Pistoriusâ€ ™ legal advisors that this issue could be raised by them , but then in the context that it had been rejected .
The high court in Pretoria is due to resume shortly to begin the third day of hearings to determine the sentence Oscar Pistorius will receive for the culpable homicide of Reeva Steenkamp .
So far this week , the court has heard testimony from four defence witnesses :
Annette Vergeer , a probation officer and social worker , who said prison would â€œnot assist him but break him as a personâ€ � .
A custodial sentence , she insisted , would â€œbe an excessive punishment with no benefits to him , society and the deceasedâ€ ™ s familyâ€ � .
But her depiction of South Africaâ€ ™ s jails as violent and overcrowded , and ill - equipped to treat someone with Pistoriusâ€ ™ disabilities , was dismissed by the prosecuting team as out - of - date .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s psychologist , Dr Lore Hartzenberg , who described him as â€œa broken man who has lost everythingâ€ � .
( â€œWe are now dealing with a broken man , but he is still alive , â€ � prosecutor Gerrie Nel pointed out . )
Joel Maringa , a social worker for the correctional services department , told the court that convictions for culpable homicide often do not result in a jail term , and recommended that the athlete should serve a three - year period of house arrest and community service â€ “ a suggestion seconded by Vergeer , but lambasted by Nel as â€œshockingly inappropriateâ€ � .
Peet van Zyl , Pistoriusâ€ ™ s manager , gave evidence about the athleteâ€ ™ s charity work ( his contribution to society is one of the factors that the judge may take into account when deciding his sentence ) , but agreed with Nel that such work was not uncommon for high - profile sports stars .
This morning , Nel is expected to continue his cross - examination of Vergeer , before moving on to call the stateâ€ ™
s own witnesses .
We know from comments made by Nel on Tuesday that one is a representative of South Africaâ€ ™ s prison system who will attempt to counter Vergeerâ€
™ s testimony that Pistoriusâ€ ™ s safety can not be guaranteed in the countryâ€ ™ s jails .

2014-10-15,"After 45 days and 40 witnesses , just when it seemed there were no surprises left , the trial of Oscar Pistorius was stunned into silence on Wednesday by the one voice it had not yet heard : Reeva Steenkamp ’s heartbroken family .
The victim ’s cousin , Kim Martin , broke down as she recalled hearing on a car radio that Pistorius had killed his girlfriend and desperately hoping it was someone else .
She said the news felt like “ the end of the world ” and gave a harrowing account of its impact .
There were tears on the courtroom benches and from the Paralympian in the dock on what was the third day of a hearing to determine his sentence on a conviction of culpable homicide .
Pistorius killed the 29-year - old model and law graduate on Valentine ’s day last year after mistaking her for an intruder and firing four bullets through a locked toilet door .
Martin told the hushed court that she and her husband were driving to work that morning and caught in rush hour traffic .
“
The radio DJ came on and he said , ‘ Breaking news , not confirmed’ , ” she said .
“
He said it three or four times
and I remember thinking , this must be big , please get on with it .
“
He said , ‘ Oscar Pistorius’ and the moment he said his name , I jumped up in the front seat and I froze .
And the next words were , ‘ has allegedly shot his girlfriend’ .
And I said to my husband , ‘ I hope to god he ’s cheating on Reeva’ .
”
Martin ’s voice cracked and she sobbed on the witness stand , forcing a brief adjournment .
Steenkamp ’s
mother June , a stoical figure for months , and father Barry succumbed to tears .
It was a charged moment and one of the most visceral in a trial that began seven months ago and absorbed millions around the world .
Resuming her testimony and struggling to regain her composure , Martin said : “ They had n’t confirmed the name , they said his girlfriend .
I was trying to phone her [ Reeva ] and she was n’t answering and I was screaming at my husband .
”
Martin said she went immediately to her mother ’s house .
“
The doors opened and my mother was hysterical and that ’s when I knew it was true .
That was for me the end of the world .
Everything was just a blur from then onwards …
We were all like , ‘ why , why , why Reeva?’ It was the worst , worst experience I have ever , ever been through .
” Prosecutor Gerrie Nel asked what effect the killing had on Steenkamp ’s mother and father .
“
She was hysterical , she ’d been looked after by someone , they were helping her to cope with it .
She was very medicated , and she just walked around shrugging her shoulders the whole time .
My uncle sat in the corner : he was crying , crying , crying .
”
Sitting in the dock , an emotional Pistorius , 27 , bent double , his head buried in his hands .
In the public gallery behind , his sister Aimee wiped a tear from her eye and uncle Arnold was visibly moved .
The tragedy had a “ terrible ” effect , Martin continued .
“
I ’d say it ’s ruined our whole family .
It ’s ruined uncle Barry and auntie June .
Reeva was everything to them .
She was their only child in PE [ Port Elizabeth ] for a long time and they absolutely adored her .
“
They were so proud of her , what she ’d accomplished .
She looked after them so well , not just financially .
That ’s why I was so worried about facing them because I did n’t know how they were going to cope .
I did n’t think they ’d be able to cope with knowing Reeva was n’t there .
”
She said Barry ’s health had deteriorated since the killing and he suffered two strokes , while in June “ the signs of stress and trauma are obvious ” .
Martin went on :
“
I spoke to my uncle and my aunt last night .
I just wanted to make sure they were going to be OK with me talking about them .
I was worried that I ’d disappoint them .
”
She struggled to retain her composure while June , listening intently , pressed her hands to her face .
“
They said to me no , I had their blessing and I must be Reeva ’s voice .
My uncle said he ’s very proud of me and no matter what I do
I ’ll never make a mistake .
He said he would love to take the stand but he ca n’t .
He said he would just lose it .
”
Asked why she was testifying , Martin , whose own children have received counselling , said : “ I must be Reeva ’s voice .
I had to do this for Reeva
, I owe it to her .
”
Earlier Martin , who was 12 years older than her cousin , began by saying Steenkamp was the first baby she had ever held .
“
There was a very strong bond from a very young age .
”
She painted a picture of a “ fun - loving child ” who was also hard working and meticulous at school and helped her parents financially .
“ Family was everything to her .
”
She also recalled how Barry wanted the young model to concentrate on her university studies and become a lawyer .
“
Her dad told her she must work hard because her life can end in a split second .
”
Martin told the court she had met Pistorius once , in January 2013 , and did not notice much affection between him and Steenkamp .
When the athlete stepped away to take a phone call , she asked her cousin if she was happy .
“
Yes , but we need to talk ,
” came the reply .
Martin said : “ That has bothered me for ever since then …
What did she mean ?
”
For three days Pistorius ’s defence team have argued for a correctional supervision sentence with periods of house arrest , potentially allowing him to resume his athletics career .
The defence called social workers who recommended he not be sent to prison , but Nel denounced this as “ shockingly inappropriate ” .
Martin will continue her testimony on Thursday ."
2014-10-16,"The last witnesses to speak in aggravation of sentence have finished their testimony today , as prosecutor Gerrie Nel brought this part of the proceedings to an unexpectedly early close .
Friday will see both state and defence present their final arguments to Judge Masipa , who will then take a few days before handing down sentence , probably next Tuesday .
But the dayâ€ ™ s headline news happened outside the official hearing , with Aimee Pistorius , sister of the athlete , allegedly threatened in the court room by Mikey Schultz , a self - confessed killer .
He denied swearing at her , calling the Pistorius family â€œa bunch of liarsâ€ � .
But the man Schultz had come to support , Jared Mortimer , who had been expected to give evidence for the state about a nightclub run - in with Pistorius , was ultimately not called by Nel after the disturbance .
Hereâ€ ™ s a rundown of Thursdayâ€ ™ s key developments : Defence counsel Barry Roux won a concession from Zac Modise , acting national head of corrections services , that it would not be suitable to house Pistorius in a general prison wing and he should be guaranteed a placement on a hospital wing .
But the defence raised concerns that there is only one resident doctor for the 7,000 inmates at Kgosi Mampuru prison , where Pistorius would be likely to serve any custodial sentence .
Threats have been made against Pistorius by gang leaders inside prison , the defence argued .
Modise argued that South African jails are the best on the continent of Africa .
Prisons are capable of dealing with disabilities , the court heard , and Pistoriusâ€ ™ s prosthetic legs could not be taken from him .
Earlier , Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s cousin Kim Martin concluded her moving testimony on the effect of the killing on her family , saying Pistorius â€œneeds to pay for what heâ€ ™ s doneâ€ � .
She told the judge : Iâ€ ™ m very fearful of the accused .
I have tried very hard to put him out of my mind .
Weâ€ ™ ve even made a point of not mentioning his name in my house , because I didnâ€ ™ t want to spend any energy thinking about him .
I really believe Mr Pistorius needs to pay for what he has done .
My family are not people who are seeking revenge .
We just feel that to take someoneâ€ ™ s life â€ ¦ needs sufficient punishment .
Court resumes on Friday morning at 9.30am South Africa time ( 8.30am BST ) for closing arguments in aggravation and mitigation of sentence .
We will again have live coverage throughout .
Oscar Pistorius has left court surrounded by significantly more police officers than usual : The court will reconvene tomorrow to hear final arguments from both state and defence , but it looks unlikely that we will see Judge Masipa hand down her sentence ( indeed , she expressed doubt earlier that Roux and Nel would be able to wrap up their arguments by close of play on Friday ) .
Sentencing , then , will be delayed â€ “ but perhaps only until next week :
After two hours of consulting with potential witnesses â€ “ and having stated earlier this week that he would be calling three or four â€ “ Gerrie Nel decided not to call anyone else to the stand , having questioned only two witnesses .
Why might that be ?
Here is snap analysis from a reporter and legal observer in Pretoria : Nel says he hasnâ€ ™ t yet seen the defenceâ€ ™ s heads of argument as itâ€ ™ s not been finalised ; once he sees it , he will finish the state heads and submit it to the court .
Judge Masipa agrees .
Court adjourns to tomorrow morning , 9.30am South Africa time ( 8.30am BST ) .
Nel says he has finished .
He suggests adjourning the hearing for today and reconvening in the morning for final arguments from both sides .
Nel says he and Roux have agreed they will conclude their arguments in one day .
Masipa begins with a reference to the remarks made by Roux to Nel ( that he should have been sworn in as a witness for leading questions ) .
She apologises for not dealing with it .
Roux apologises and withdraws the comment .
Judge Masipa is back and the hearing begins again .
Is it possible that we have seen the end of the prosecutionâ€ ™ s case ?
There were suggestions that Jared Mortimer would be called today â€ “ itâ€
™ s possible that the events at lunchtime have put paid to that .
Marc Batchelor and Jared Mortimer , say reporters in court in Pretoria , are now sitting in the front row of the public gallery on the Steenkamp â€œsideâ€ � .
There are also several more police officers in the room , along with justice department marshals .
Mikey Schultz has been talking to reporters outside the court .
He says he is here only to support his friend Jared Mortimer : We were in the same row as the Pistoriuses â€
¦
They started telling me and my friend Marc , like we were dogs , we have to move .
Now thereâ€ ™ s allegations that we threatened them â€ ¦
There were no threats at any time .
I didnâ€
™ t say anything to [ Aimee Pistorius ] .
Sheâ€ ™ s a liar just like her brother .
Some background on Schultz , a self - confessed killer , here .
Jared Mortimer â€ “ who could yet give evidence today
â€ “ and Marc Batchelor are reportedly back in the court room , but sitting at the back now , away from the Pistorius family .
Mikey Schultz is still outside court ; heâ€ ™ s told reporters that he hasnâ€ ™ t been asked to leave and might return tomorrow .
Aimee Pistorius is also back in court , where the hearing is due to resume imminently .
Kim Martin , the cousin of Reeva Steenkamp , who finished her testimony earlier today , has tweeted the following message : The apparent threats made to Aimee Pistorius in court today have cracked open the tensions between the two families : The men are not at the heart of the Steenkamp camp , but are friends with the Myers family , close friends of Reeva Steenkamp .
Marc Batchelor was on the state witness list but did not actually give evidence earlier in the trial against Pistorius ; Jared Mortimer is expected to give testimony later today about his run - in with the athlete in a nightclub .
Mikey Schultz admitted killing mining magnate Brett Kebble in 2005 but was given indemnity from prosecution in exchange for testimony against another criminal .
The three men have been talking to reporters outside court , calling the Pistorius family â€œa bunch of liarsâ€ � : The Guardian video team has put together this clip of Kim Martin , Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s cousin , telling the court she feels â€œfearfulâ€ � of Pistorius : Extramural dramas excepted , this morning has been dominated by discussion of the merits and failings of the South African prison system , as the defence continues to push its case that a custodial sentence would not be appropriate for the disabled athlete .
Hereâ€ ™ s a quick recap of the key developments : Prosecutor Gerrie Nel has said testimony and arguments will be finalised by tomorrow , increasing the chances that sentence will not be handed down until November .
Defence counsel Barry Roux won a concession from Zac Modise , acting national head of corrections services , that it would not be suitable to house Pistorius in a general prison wing and he should be guaranteed a placement on a hospital wing .
But the defence raised concerns that there is only one resident doctor for the 7,000 inmates at Kgosi Mampuru prison , where Pistorius would be likely to serve any custodial sentence .
Threats have been made against Pistorius by gang leaders inside prison , the defence argued .
Modise argued that South African jails are the best on the continent of Africa .
Prisons are capable of dealing with disabilities , the court heard , and Pistoriusâ€ ™ s prosthetic legs could not be taken from him .
Earlier , Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s cousin Kim Martin concluded her moving testimony on the effect of the killing on her family , saying Pistorius â€œneeds to pay for what heâ€ ™ s doneâ€ � .
She told the judge : Iâ€ ™ m very fearful of the accused .
I have tried very hard to put him out of my mind .
Weâ€ ™ ve even made a point of not mentioning his name in my house , because I didnâ€ ™ t want to spend any energy thinking about him .
I really believe Mr Pistorius needs to pay for what he has done .
My family are not people who are seeking revenge .
We just feel that to take someoneâ€ ™ s life â€ ¦ needs sufficient punishment .
The court is due to resume at 2 pm South Africa time ( 1 pm BST ) .
The DSTV Oscar Trial TV channel reports that the Mikey Schultz drama has spilled out from the courtroom into the street : Schultz apparently left court with Marc Batchelor ( who has claimed Pistorius previously threatened to break his legs ) and Jared Mortimer , who recently clashed with Pistorius in a Johannesburg nightclub .
DSTV reports that the three men narrowly missed Pistorius himself â€ “ who , unusually , has left the court building for the lunch break â€ “ but stopped to take pictures with members of the Myers family , friends of Reeva Steenkamp .
My colleague David Smith reports from the high court in Pretoria that the Pistorius family has asked that Roux and Nel be consulted on an application to have Schultz barred from the hearing , so
itâ€ ™ s likely this issue could escalate when proceedings resume this afternoon .
Thereâ€ ™ s a disturbance in court as the Pistorius family try to have two men â€ “ one of whom is Mikey Schultz , a self - confessed killer â€ “ moved from the benches reserved for the defendantâ€ ™ s family and supporters :
Aimee Pistorius , sister of the athlete , is now said to have left court in tears .
Nel wants a long lunch break now to prepare a witness , but promises the judge : â€œWe will finalise arguments tomorrow whatever happens.â€ �
This seems to make it more likely that we will not see sentence handed down this week ; given the judgeâ€ ™ s other commitments , it could now be November before the judge delivers her decision .
This is by no means certain : the state has insisted it will be this week .
But this trial has been beset by pauses and delays .
Court adjourns till 2 pm South Africa time ( 1 pm BST ) .
I will post a summary of the morningâ€ ™ s proceedings shortly .
Nel is skimming over what are by now quite familiar issues : a prisonerâ€ ™ s right to a private medical practitioner ; the ability to take a complaint to the high court if itâ€ ™ s not dealt with properly by prison authorities .
Then heâ€ ™ s finished .
The witness is excused , after a quick question from Judge Masipa about training courses : she wants to know if they are mandatory .
Roux is finished with this witness .
Gerrie Nel is back on his feet for re - examination .
Nel :
Like any department or organisation you have people who donâ€ ™ t follow the rules â€ ¦
but you deal with that ?
Modise :
That is correct .
Nel :
But there are many more people who are dedicated , who follow rules ?
Roux objects : shouldnâ€ ™ t Nel be sworn in if he is going to give evidence himself ?
Laughter in the court ( but not from Nel :
â€œThis isnâ€ ™ t the time for jokesâ€ � ) .
Now Roux turns to the risks of the hospital section :
Modise reiterates that Pistorius would be assessed if sentenced to prison .
Roux pounces : the witness earlier said only a hospital wing would be suitable for the defendant .
Now heâ€
™ s saying he must go through this assessment before it is decided where he will be placed ?
Modise :
Thereâ€ ™ s nothing that is taken for granted on admission .
Judge Masipa intervenes :
isnâ€
™ t it true that the health assessment is done within six hours of admission to prison ?
Modise agrees this is so .
But what if the assessment doesnâ€ ™ t recommend Pistorius goes to the hospital wing , Roux asks : where does he go ?
He will go where he is supposed to go , Modise replies .
The assessment will say he needs to go to the hospital unit .
Pistorius is disabled â€ “ â€œeveryone knows thatâ€ � .
Roux worries away at him : so there is no need for an assessment , he asks Modise .
The witness says there has to be an assessment but he is
â€œabsolutelyâ€ �
sure Pistorius will be assigned to the hospital wing .
Roux turns to the question of inmates paying for their own private doctors .
Such a doctor would have to drive from his or her consulting rooms to the prison , and get through the security measures , Roux says ; this would take time and be expensive .
Roux asks about food in the hospital unit .
Those well enough get it from the serving area , Modise explains ; less fit patients have food brought to their beds .
Modise says he doesnâ€ ™ t know how many patients are in the hospital section .
Seven of the individual rooms are occupied but he doesnâ€ ™ t know about the wards .
Roux is concerned about whether any are suffering from tuberculosis .
He refers to data from the National Health Laboratory Services , which suggests thousands of prisoners across South Africa may have tuberculosis .
Modise talks through disease screening measures in the prison .
How do you get in and out of the hospital wing , Roux asks .
There are entrances , Modise deadpans .
Modise says he learned from Makgoba that the hospital has five communal wards , each with a bath and shower .
There are 22 single cells , of which seven are currently occupied .
There are seven nurses during the day , and two at night .
But only one resident doctor and five psychologists for 7,000 inmates , Roux presses him .
Modisa confirms this but says there are other visiting doctors .
Not all offenders need psychological services , he adds .
Zac Modise , acting national head of the department of correctional services , is still on the stand , facing cross - examination by Barry Roux for the defence .
Modise confirms that during the break he was able to speak to Joe Makgoba , deputy area commissioner of Kgosi Mampuru prison , and others who are in court .
Reuters has filed this recap of this morningâ€ ™ s proceedings : Olympic and Paralympic track star Oscar Pistorius needs to go to jail for the killing of his 29-year - old girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , on Valentineâ€ ™ s day last year , her cousin told a South African court on Thursday .
â€˜I feel we need to send a message to society that you canâ€ ™ t get away with this , â€ ™ Kim Martin said in her second day of testimony at Pistoriusâ€ ™ s sentencing hearing .
Judge Thokozile Masipa cut short the previous dayâ€ ™ s proceedings after Martin broke down on the stand , overwhelmed with emotion as she described the Steenkampsâ€ ™ â€˜ruinedâ€ ™ family life after Reevaâ€ ™ s death .
â€˜My family is not seeking revenge , but he shot someone behind a door , unarmed , harmless , â€ ™ Martin said .
â€˜It needs sufficient punishment.â€ ™ Pistoriusâ€ ™ s defence has been fighting to keep the 27-year - old double - amputee out of jail , citing his disability as one reason why he should be allowed to serve any punishment outside South Africaâ€ ™ s notoriously violent and overcrowded prisons .
Earlier in the sentencing hearing , a defence witness recommended Pistorius serve three years of house arrest combined with community service .
Pistorius , one of the biggest names in world athletics , was last month convicted of culpable homicide â€ “ South Africaâ€ ™ s equivalent of manslaughter â€ “ for killing Steenkamp by firing four shots through a locked toilet door .
Pistorius said it was a tragic mistake , and that he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder .
Culpable homicide in South Africa is punishable by up to 15 years in prison in the most serious cases , or by a suspended sentence , house arrest and community service in lighter ones .
Giving evidence , Modise suggested Pistorius could serve any custodial sentence in Kgosi Mampuru II prison , formerly Pretoria Central .
The jail was renamed last year as â€œpart of a process â€ ¦ aimed at turning correctional centres into places of hope and changeâ€ � .
Modise told the court there is a gym at the prison , as well as a hospital unit .
Modise is now talking the court through the priorities for assigning single cells .
Roux steers him : letâ€ ™ s only talk about the hospital wing , he says , as we agree that this is the only place suitable for Pistorius .
Roux suggests an adjournment to allow Modise to gather some extra information before questioning him on how many single cells and other facilities are available in the hospital wing .
Masipa allows the half - hour break .
She also thanks the courtroom for its applause at the mention of her birthday at the start of proceedings â€ “ which earns her another burst of clapping .
Court adjourns for a tea break .
Roux : Are you aware of cases in court where inmates complain they do not get medical care , medical facilities ?
Modise :
Yes â€
¦
I donâ€
™ t think itâ€ ™ s a great number .
If there are not shower doors , there are plastic curtains , Modise tells the court .
Roux sighs .
The general section is not suitable for Pistorius , he says ; only the hospital section .
Is that a fair assessment , he asks .
Thatâ€ ™ s a fair summary , Modise admits .
Modise confirms that vulnerable prisoners should go to the hospital section of the prison rather than the main part of the jail .
Thereâ€ ™ s a bath there , Roux checks with him .
In the â€œnormalâ€ � section , there are only showers .
Roux says heâ€ ™ s had many calls from prison warders telling him there are no baths in the regular prison section , and there are no shower doors or they are broken .
Modise concedes on the baths point but is defensive on the question of the doors ; perhaps we should go and see for ourselves , Roux suggests .
The prison system has improved but is â€œstill not where we want it to beâ€ � , Modise tells Roux .
The defence lawyer turns to correctional supervision and community service â€ “ the sentence the Pistorius team are recommending to the judge .
He quotes a policy paper saying such non - custodial sentences should be considered for disabled people .
Roux reads from newspaper reports about the alleged threats to Pistorius : This thug , calling himself â€˜The Generalâ€ ™ , has been in prison for the past 33 years and is the leader of the feared 26s prison gang .
Using a prison call box , this jailbird promised Pistorius hell , saying his wealth would not buy him a lavish prison lifestyle
â€ “ instead he would â€˜be taken outâ€ ™ .
â€˜Anyone who thinks they can come here and live like a king , will have a hit on their head .
If he thinks he is going to come here and buy his way to get computers and cellphones and a lavish lifestyle , he must know that will never happen for as long as I am around.â€ ™ Roux asks Modise if he knows of any threats made against Pistorius .
He doesnâ€ ™ t .
Roux is surprised : these have been widely reported , he tells the witness .
Modise reiterates : he is not aware of any threats .
Roux quotes statistics showing a rise in cases of torture in prison , from 71 to 109 last year .
â€œThere may be acts of torture , â€ � Modise concedes .
There was an increase in assaults by prison staff as well , Roux says .
Modise says this is down to the need to take control of gang culture in certain institutions , St Albans and Manguang .
Roux reads from yesterdayâ€ ™ s Star newspaper saying that Modise had come under fire in parliament for an increase in jail rape and torture cases .
Modise says the Wits project is run by two journalists being fed unverified information by certain prison officials : Their objective is to write anything that is negative , sourced by themselves .
Adamantly , Modise is telling the court there should be â€œno doubt in the mind of South Africansâ€ � that Pistoriusâ€ ™ s disabilities could be catered for in prison .
Nel is finished with this witness .
Defence counsel Barry Roux is on his feet now for cross - examination .
Modise says he has visited prisons all over the world and there are three things that are common in all : gangsterism , drugs and sharpened objects .
Overcrowding in South African jails is down from 63 % to 31 % .
Modise adds that a full inspection of South African prisons was carried out before the extradition of Shrien Dewani from the UK , and they passed .
Dewani is currently on trial in Cape Town for the murder of his wife Anni on their honeymoon .
Nel moves on to how prisons cater for disabled inmates .
Modise says the testimony of defence witness Annette Vergeer that jails lack facilities such as shower rails is â€œincorrectâ€ � .
He agrees with Nel that pictures taken in a prison yesterday clearly show shower rails and baths available to inmates .
Modise says South African jails deal with 128 disabled prisoners on a daily basis , ranging from blindness to paraplegia .
Suitable accommodation is provided , he says .
Nel asks if Pistoriusâ€ ™ s needs could be catered for .
Modise :
should it be the decision of this court to send him to Kgosi Mampuru
, I assure you we will be able to accommodate him .
Nel : And treat him humanely during his period of incarceration ?
Modise :
Absolutely â€
¦
He shall be treated properly .
Kgosi Mampuru is a Pretoria jail .
Modise :
In the continent of Africa , there are no better facilities than those that we have in our country .
He says South African jails compare favourably with those in the UK and New York .
Modise is certainly painting a very positive picture of South Africaâ€ ™ s jails .
We can probably expect the defence to take issue with this when Roux gets his opportunity to cross - examine : Modise :
I can assure this court the Department of Correctional Services are dealing with the issue of gangsterism .
He says gangs are not created in prison â€ “ some inmates come in as gang leaders .
He confirms that single cells or a place in a hospital unit are ways to mitigate the risk of gang violence .
Modise says he asked a prisons official to visit a local facility , and confirms that official is in court today .
He then runs through the various psychological services available in prison .
Again , prisoners are able to use their own private therapists , at their own cost .
Nel continues his questioning of Modise , designed to show that â€ “ as the prosecutor put it yesterday
â€ “ the court would be doing Pistorius a favour by sending him to prison :
Modise talks through the health assessment that takes place within six hours of admission to prison .
It includes assessment of social , psychological and spiritual needs , and caters for different vulnerabilities , he explains .
That assessment determines where the prisoner is placed .
The witness confirms that Pistoriusâ€ ™ s prosthetic legs could not be taken from him without written instruction .
He then runs through the prison complaints system : officials have to deal with inmatesâ€ ™ complaints every day , and there are also independent assessors .
Modise is running through the various assessments that take place when an individual is sentenced to prison .
A health assessment is carried out within six hours of admission to jail , he says .
He confirms that if an inmate wanted his own private medical practitioner , that would be possible , at the prisonerâ€ ™ s own cost .
Nel is slowly picking his way through the objections raised by the defence to imprisoning Pistorius : Modise tells the court that the corrections department offered to send someone to Pretoria to give a response to the criticisms of prisons raised by the Pistorius defence .
Modise says he was involved in the Jali commission , charged with remedying â€œinhumane conditionsâ€ � and â€œrampant corruptionâ€ � in prisons .
Nel is running through Modiseâ€ ™ s career and experience in correctional services .
As a public servant , Modise is shown on television ; most witnesses are heard but not shown on screen .
The next witness is Moleko Zac Modise , from the department of correctional services , where he is the acting national commissioner .
Nel confirms with Modise that only yesterday he presented a report in parliament , and told parliament that prisons are â€œready to admit and detain people with disabilities in our facilitiesâ€ � .
Roux tells the court that Pistorius â€œdesperatelyâ€ � wants to apologise privately to the Steenkamp family .
Kim Martin is excused .
Roux now tells Martin that Pistorius wrote many apologetic letters to June and Barry Steenkamp , parents of Reeva , after the shooting but was advised by lawyers not to send them .
He asks if she has spoken to Pistorius .
She has not .
Barry Roux is questioning Martin now .
He says Martin testified yesterday that Steenkamp spent Christmas alone .
In fact she had dinner with Pistorius , Roux tells her .
Martin accepts this could be true .
Kim Martin is standing in the witness box and continues her testimony , questioned by Nel .
He asks her about Pistoriusâ€ ™ public apology to the family of Reeva Steenkamp .
Martin says she did not feel it was genuine or sincere .
How does she feel about Pistorius now , Nel asks her .
Martin : Iâ€ ™ m very fearful of the accused .
I have tried very hard to put him out of my mind .
Weâ€ ™ ve even made a point of not mentioning his name in my house , because I didnâ€ ™ t want to spend any energy thinking about him .
This is not easy for me
â€
¦
I really believe Mr Pistorius needs to pay for what he has done .
My family are not people who are seeking revenge .
We just feel that to take someoneâ€ ™ s life â€ ¦ needs sufficient punishment .
I was very worried when I was under the belief that prison conditions would be bad for prison .
When I discovered that his rehabilitation process in the prison would be humane â€
¦
I feel Mr Pistorius needs to pay for what heâ€ ™
s done â€ ¦ to my family but also what heâ€ ™ s done to his family We need a message to society that you canâ€ ™ t do this .
With that , Nel is finished with this witness .
Judge Masipa has entered the court room and we are about to start .
( Today is the judgeâ€ ™ s 67th birthday , incidentally .
Gerrie Nel begins by wishing her a happy birthday , to applause from the court . )
Oscar Pistorius is in court and the hearing is due to start very shortly .
Yesterday , Judge Thokozile Masipa said she wanted this sentencing hearing to be concluded by tomorrow , as she has other judging commitments from next week .
This could mean she will hand down sentence on Pistorius on Friday .
However , some South African court observers think we could be in for a longer wait : Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s cousin Kim Martin is in court already , to resume her testimony from yesterday .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel indicated on Wednesday afternoon that he did not intend to question her much further ; defence counsel Barry Roux also stated he had only two questions for her in cross - examination .
So we could move on to the next state witness fairly promptly .
There is speculation that Patricia Taylor , mother of Pistoriusâ€ ™ ex - girlfriend Samantha Taylor and author of a recent book about the athlete , Oscar :
An Accident Waiting to Happen , could give evidence .
She is in court in Pretoria this morning and reporters say she has brought a friend with her â€œfor supportâ€ � .
Hereâ€ ™ s my colleague Rebecca Davis on what we know about Taylor : Trish Taylor , as she prefers to be known , is the mother of Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ s ex - girlfriend Samantha Taylor .
Pistorius and Sam Taylorâ€ ™ s tumultuous relationship began in 2011 â€ “ when Taylor was still a high school student â€“and lasted for about a year and a half , depending who you ask .
Sam Taylor testified against Pistorius during his murder trial , and claimed on the stand that the relationship ended because â€˜he cheated on me with Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ .
Trish Taylor has been a part of the Pistorius trial narrative since writing on Facebook on the day of Steenkampâ€ ™ s shooting : â€˜I am so glad that Sammy is safe and sound and out of the clutches of that manâ€ ™ â€ “ an opinion leapt upon by journalists desperately seeking to make sense of bewildering events at that stage .
In September 2014 Taylor released Oscar : An Accident Waiting To Happen , an account of her daughterâ€ ™ s relationship with Pistorius co - authored with a South African journalist .
The book â€ “ which was written before the trialâ€ ™ s outcome but which could not be released prior to the verdict for legal reasons
â€ “ paints a picture of Pistorius as moody , volatile , self - involved and philandering .
Welcome to live coverage of the fourth day of the hearing to determine what sentence Oscar Pistorius will receive for the two charges of which he was found guilty last month : the culpable homicide of Reeva Steenkamp and illegally discharging a firearm in a crowded restaurant .
Yesterdayâ€ ™ s proceedings ended on a highly emotional note as Kim Martin , the victimâ€ ™ s cousin , took to the stand to be â€œReevaâ€ ™ s voiceâ€
� in describing how the loss has affected her family .
She will return to the stand this morning for some final questions from prosecutor Gerrie Nel , before facing cross - examination from defence counsel Barry Roux , who will surely tread carefully with a witness who was openly distressed during her earlier testimony .
Hereâ€ ™ s a recap of Wednesdayâ€ ™ s key developments : Nel has assured the judge that he intends to wrap up his questions for his â€œthree or fourâ€ � witnesses by this afternoon , which â€ “ given the judgeâ€ ™ s other commitments in coming weeks
â€ “ suggests sentence will be handed down on Friday .
Kim Martin broke down as she told the court she had heard the news of the shooting on the radio while driving to work on 14 February 2013 : Then [ the radio DJ ] said : â€˜Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ â€ ¦ and the minute he said his name
I jumped in the front seat
and I froze .
And the next words were : â€˜allegedly shot his girlfriendâ€ ™ .
And I said to my husband , â€˜I hope
to god heâ€ ™ s cheating on Reeva.â€ ™
In moving testimony , Martin told the court about Reeva Steenkamp , who she said was a hard worker , a fun - loving and nurturing person , who supported her parents financially .
She said the loss of her cousin had â€˜ruined our whole familyâ€ ™ .
After breaking her back in a horse - riding accident after studying for a law degree , Steenkamp had pursued a modelling career because â€˜life can be over so quicklyâ€ ™ .
Lawyers for June and Barry Steenkamp , Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents , clarified details of the payments made to them by Oscar Pistorius since their daughter was killed .
They say the R6000 monthly payments will be repaid and the Steenkamps will not pursue a civil claim against the athlete .
Barry Roux , for Pistorius , told the court that his client did not want the money back and had given it â€œwithout conditionsâ€ � .
Nel vigorously sought to undermine the picture painted by defence witnesses of a violent , overcrowded prison system in which Pistoriusâ€ ™ s disabilities would not be catered for .
There was not â€œthe slightest possibilityâ€ � that Pistoriusâ€ ™ s prostheses would be confiscated , he told the court .
The Department of Correctional Services has issued a statement calling the defence claims â€œinaccurateâ€ � .
Nel is likely to call a witness today to testify to this .

Davidâ€ ™ s report on Wednesdayâ€ ™ s court hearing is here , and yesterdayâ€ ™ s live blog is here .
Todayâ€ ™ s court hearing is due to start at 9.30am South Africa time ( 8.30am BST ) ."
2014-10-16,"Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ s sister Aimee broke down in tears on Thursday after a self - confessed killer sat near the family in court and allegedly swore at her in a threatening manner .
The Pistorius family accused Mikey Schultz , a muscle - bound former hitman , of trying to intimidate them and complained to police during the trial in Pretoria , South Africa .
Schultz branded them â€œa bunch of liarsâ€ � .
The feud erupted just before the state rested its case at the sentencing hearing , where Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s cousin Kim Martin said Pistorius , convicted of culpable homicide after killing the model and law graduate , â€œneeds to pay for what he has doneâ€ � .
Schultz confessed to shooting dead businessman Brett Kebble in September 2005 but , with two accomplices , escaped prosecution in an immunity deal with the state effectively brokered by Gerrie Nel , now prosecutor in the Pistorius trial .
Killing Kebble , a book by South African journalist Mandy Wiener , devotes a two - page prologue to Schultzâ€ ™ s tattoos including a red flag with skull , Jesusâ€ ™
s face with red blood and â€œOutlawâ€
� written across his stomach .
As court was in session on Thursday , Schultz and fellow ex - boxer Marc Strydom sat in the front row of the public gallery , an area usually occupied by the Pistorius family .
Aimee spotted them and began making a hand gesture across her throat to police in the courtroom , indicating that the pair should be told to move , but the police took no action .
The court adjourned for lunch and Schultz and Strydom made for the exit while exchanging hostile stares with Aimee , who forced a bitter smile but then became tearful and distraught .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t want him anywhere near me , â€ � she told reporters , adding that his presence would hurt the familyâ€ ™ s reputation .
Later Pistoriusâ€ ™ s brother , Carl , said Schultz had mouthed â€œFuck youâ€ � to his sister and expressed his concern to lawyers and police .
Schultz denied the allegation , saying that he was in court to support his friend Jared Mortimer , a potential witness after a recent nightclub altercation with Pistorius , though he did not in fact testify .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re making up a fabricated story , same as Oscarâ€ ™ s , â€ � Schultz said .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re all a bunch of liars.â€ �
He told the Oscar Pistorius Trial TV channel : â€œWithin a matter of five minutesâ€œ we were in the same row as the Pistoriuses .
They started telling me and my friend Mark , like weâ€ ™ re dogs , that we must move off the seats .
I was like , what for ?
â€
¦ We then got up and walked outside and now thereâ€ ™ s allegations that we threatened them .
Please go and look at the footage in the court , we never threatened them at any time.â€ �
Of Aimee , he said : â€œI
didnâ€ ™ t say anything to her .
Sheâ€
™ s a liar just like her brother.â€ �
Later , on South Africaâ€ ™ s Talk Radio 702
, he said : â€œAs far as I know , court is a public place .
Iâ€ ™ ve been in court a few times â€
¦
The way they carry on in that court , they act as if theyâ€ ™ ve bought the court , they own the court.â€ �
Schultz is also believed to be a friend of Marc Batchelor , a former footballer who alleged Pistorius threatened to break his legs over an ex - girlfriend and who has been a regular in the public gallery .
Earlier the court heard claims that a prison gang leader has threatened to â€œtake outâ€ � Pistorius if he is given preferential treatment in jail .
Defence lawyer Barry Roux quoted newspaper reports that Khalil Subjee , known as â€œthe generalâ€ � , had said he would order â€œa hitâ€ � on the double amputee athlete during an interview from a prison phone box .
Witness Zach Modise , the acting national commissioner for correctional services , said he was unaware of such reports .
He acknowledged there is gang activity but said overcrowding has gone down and Pistorius would be safe in the countryâ€ ™ s prisons , which he said were the best in Africa and compared favourably with those he visited in the UK and US .
â€œWe will be able to accommodate him , â€ � Modise said .
If he is jailed , Pistorius , whom the court found mistook Steenkamp for a burglar when he shot four times through a toilet door , will most likely be sent to the hospital section of Kgosi Mumpuru prison in Pretoria .
Roux noted that the jail has only one resident doctor and five psychologists for 7,000 inmates .
But Kim Martin , Steenkampâ€ ™ s cousin , told the court that Pistorius should be jailed for his actions .
â€œI can say honestly to the court that Mr Pistorius needs to pay for what he has done , for taking Reevaâ€ ™ s life , for what heâ€ ™ s done to my uncle , to my aunt and the rest of my family , â€ �
she said .
â€œMy family are not people who are seeking revenge , we just feel that to take someoneâ€ ™ s life , to shoot somebody behind a door , that is unarmed , that is harmless , needs sufficient punishment
â€
¦ Everybody has suffered here , and I think we need send a message to society that you can not do this and get away with it .
I donâ€
™ t feel the suggested punishment would fit the crime.â€ � Martin , 42 , said she did not believe Pistoriusâ€ ™ s apology to the Steenkamp family from the witness stand was genuine .
â€œI remember crying and it brought back to reality
all we were hearing and it was because Reeva was dead ,
â€ � she said .
â€œUnfortunately it didnâ€ ™ t seem sincere.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ m very fearful of the accused .
I have tried very hard to put him out of my mind .
We have even made a point of not mentioning his name in our house because I didnâ€ ™ t want to spend any of my energy thinking about him.â€

The prosecution and defence will present closing arguments on Friday , with the sentencing expected on Tuesday ."
2014-10-17,"David Smith has filed this report from court in Pretoria on todayâ€ ™ s developments .
Plus here you can see video highlights of Fridayâ€ ™ s court proceedings : The defence and the state have now concluded their arguments in mitigation and aggravation of sentence .
Now everything rests in the hands of Judge Thokozile Masipa , who will return to court on Tuesday morning to hand down sentence on Oscar Pistorius .
The defence case Pistoriusâ€ ™ s legal team say he should not be sent to prison because he is also a victim of what happened on 14 February 2013 : There was an accused and a victim â€ ¦ and the accused became a victim .
We have a man who negligently , in an anxious and vulnerable state of mind , killed the woman that he loved .
Negative media coverage and lurid speculation on social media â€ “ which Judge Masipa said she would not take into account â€ “ as well as the prosecutionâ€ ™ s treatment of Pistorius in court ,
had left him a broken man : He was denigrated â€ ¦ a cold - blooded killer .
He has lost everything .
He doesnâ€ ™ t even have money to pay legal expenses .
He has nothing left .
Lead counsel Barry Roux said the judge should apply the principle of ubuntu , humane punishment , in allowing Pistorius to â€œmake goodâ€ � by doing something for society .
The money he paid to the parents of Reeva Steenkamp shows he wants to take responsibility .
A community service can be appropriate in cases such as this : Is this a person you must remove from society ?
â€
¦
We say no .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s true sentence has been the loss of the woman he loved : Itâ€ ™ s deep and itâ€ ™ s permanent and it wonâ€ ™ t go away â€ ¦
No punishment can be worse than the last 18 months .
Sending Pistorius to prison , where he might not get proper medical care , could increase his risk of suicide and compromise the care he needs for his disabilities .
Pistorius â€œabsolutelyâ€ � accepts the verdict of culpable homicide but his negligence in killing Reeva Steenkamp was born out of a genuine , if erroneous , belief that his life was at risk .
The state case Lead prosecutor Gerrie Nel said Pistorius must go to prison for at least 10 years : The only , but only , reasonable sentence would be a long - term incarceration .
In argument that veered close to implying Judge Masipa had made the wrong judgment in clearing Pistorius of murder , Nel said any sentence should acknowledge that the degree of negligence involved made the offence very close to murder .
A community sentence would be â€œshockingly disproportionateâ€ � to the crime : Society trusts the court to deal with criminals
â€
¦
To be harsh if it has to .
Pistorius has â€œshamelesslyâ€ � used his disability as an excuse and wants the court to think of him , not Steenkamp , as the victim in this case .
The state does not believe he has shown remorse : The fact that heâ€ ™ s sorry sheâ€ ™ s dead is not remorse for what he did â€
¦
It is not good enough .
The court has had months of hearing and thinking about Oscar Pistorius .
It now needs to think about Reeva Steenkamp and her family : What could be worse than hearing your child died a violent death ?
Iâ€ ™ ve thought about it : nothing .
The deceased did nothing to contribute to her death .
She did nothing .
She died a horrific death â€
¦
She had nowhere to go .
The state believes Pistoriusâ€ ™ s offer of a financial settlement to Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents was â€œan attempt to influence sentenceâ€ � .
It is not the business of the court to worry about conditions in prison : Pistorius can be catered for .
That is all for the live blog for today .
Live coverage will resume on Tuesday morning at 9.30am South Africa time ( 8.30am BST ) , when we expect sentence to be handed down .
Thank you for reading .
Reuters has filed this report on the dayâ€ ™ s hearing : Oscar Pistorius should serve at least 10 years in prison for killing his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , on Valentineâ€ ™ s day last year , the state prosecutor said at the close of the athleteâ€ ™ s sentencing hearing on Friday .
Judge Thokozile Masipa adjourned the session until Tuesday , when she is expected to sentence Pistorius .
The 27-year - old Paralympic and Olympic athlete , whose lower legs were amputated as a baby , was convicted of culpable homicide last month for the shooting of Steenkamp , a 29-year - old law graduate and model .
â€˜The minimum term that society will be happy with will be 10 years imprisonment , â€ ™ chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel told the hearing .
â€˜This is a serious matter .
The negligence borders on intent .
Ten years is the minimum.â€ ™
The defence and prosecution teams have spent much of the five - day sentencing hearing arguing over whether Pistorius should go to jail or be punished with house arrest and community service .
Legal experts are split on the likely outcome .
A non - custodial sentence would be likely to spark public anger , fuelling a perception among black South Africans that , 20 years after the end of white - minority apartheid rule , wealthy whites can still secure preferential justice .
â€˜We
shouldnâ€
™ t fail the parents .
We shouldnâ€ ™ t fail society .
Society may lose its trust in the court , â€ ™ Nel said .
Defence attorney Barry Roux earlier said the sprinter should be given community service because he had shown remorse and had been punished enough since he shot dead Steenkamp through a toilet door in his Pretoria apartment .
Pistorius said he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder .
â€˜He wants to make good as far as possible .
Serious regard should be given to a community - based sentence so something good can come out of this , â€ ™ Roux said .
For those readers who think this trial â€ “ which began in March â€ “ has taken a long time to get to this point :
Itâ€ ™ s worth remembering that Pistorius is also facing sentencing for his conviction for the negligent use of a firearm , when he fired a gun in a crowded restaurant a month before he shot Reeva Steenkamp .
Neither side dwelt on this issue during the sentencing hearing , understandably focusing on the far more serious charge of culpable homicide .
But Pistorius could face a maximum of five years in prison on the firearms charge â€ “ although a suspended sentence or a fine on this count seems more probable .
Judge Masipa thanks both sides .
She has been impressed by how both sides have conducted themselves throughout the trial .
The court will reconvene on Tuesday at 9.30am South Africa time ( 8.30am BST ) for sentence to be handed down .
Court adjourns for the day .
I will post a summary shortly .
Nel springs up again : if all Pistorius needs in the shower is a â€œlittle bench
â€
¦ we can take a little bench to any prisonâ€ � .
He is done now too .
Nel is finished .
Roux has some points he wants to counter .
He says that in the shower room of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s home , he has a bench to sit on rather than rails .
The money offered to the Steenkamps was done privately and not in expectation of a lesser sentence .
He refers to the video reconstruction of the killing made by the Pistorius team : that was never intended for public viewing and should not have been used by the media , he says .
Thatâ€ ™ s it from Roux .
Judge Masipa points out that Nel did not specify the length of prison term he would recommend .
Nel says the state would be happy with a minimum term of 10 years .
The prosecutor now wants to address
Rouxâ€ ™ s references to ubuntu ( for a definition , see here ) .
This case is too serious for such a principle , Nel says .
It is not relevant .
He dispenses with this very quickly .
Nel disputes claims that Pistoriusâ€ ™ s prosthetic legs could be taken from him in prison .
But , he adds , â€œwith respectâ€ � , it is not the courtâ€ ™ s role to decide on prison conditions , only on a suitable sentence .
If prisons canâ€ ™ t cater for him , weâ€ ™ ll come back to court , he says .
We donâ€
™ t know what Pistorius will do if he doesnâ€
™ t go to prison , Nel says .
He may or may not return to athletics , or work for his uncle Arnold Pistorius .
The suggestion from the defence is that he would work two days a month in community service .
Is that enough ?
Nel explains to the court why Pistorius must go to prison .
The accused did not fire just one warning shot , but fired four times .
He was competent with a firearm but created this dangerous situation .
Nel :
We argue that the only , but only , reasonable sentence would be a long - term incarceration .
Judge Masipa intervenes :
â€œYou can take it from me , â€ � she tells Nel , â€œall those paragraphs [ on negative media coverage ] will be disregarded.â€
�
The media reports on this case are irrelevant , Nel says .
Nobody forced Pistorius to read them .
They should have no bearing .
Once again , Nel references Shrien Dewaniâ€ ™ s extradition from the UK to South Africa as evidence of the suitability of prisons .
He pours scorn on the report from defence witness Annette Vergeer , accusing her of cribbing her research from the internet .
Prison conditions are dignified , he says .
Nel raises Pistoriusâ€ ™ s involvement in an altercation in a nightclub this summer .
Not much evidence of remorse there , he says .
On to the issue of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s disability , Nel notes that the athlete fought to race alongside able - bodied sprinters .
Itâ€ ™ s
â€œshamelessâ€ � that he now uses his disability as an excuse , he says .
He concedes he is on â€œdangerous groundâ€ � on this point but ploughs on .
The defence makes much of the lack of shower rails in prison , he says â€ “ there are no shower rails in Pistoriusâ€ ™ s own home .
Nel disputes Rouxâ€ ™ s claim that Pistorius has been open and honest about what happened on the night of 14 February 2013 .
He has given so many different versions , Nel says .
The prosecutor goes on : he is not convinced by Pistoriusâ€ ™ s apparent remorse .
The fact that heâ€ ™ s sorry
sheâ€ ™
s dead
is not remorse â€
¦
It is not good enough .
Pistorius should apologise for firing the shots through the door , Nel says : he needs to be remorseful for what heâ€ ™ s done .
This case is not a momentary lapse in concentration , Nel says :
itâ€ ™ s on the other end of the culpable homicide spectrum .
We , the state , say the accused deliberately fired the shots , Nel says , acknowledging the state failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he had foreseen that he could kill the person behind the door .
[ 13.03BST edit : This paragraph was tweaked to clarify that it was the foresight that the state failed to prove , not the deliberate firing of shots , which the judge did accept . ]
Nel is really on the attack here : Nel says he has heard many voices saying â€œplease donâ€
™ t break the accusedâ€ � with the trial , and the sentence .
He broke a family , Nel points out .
Sarcastically , he parodies the Pistorius account :
Iâ€ ™ m a victim , feel sorry for me , the media victimised me .
When I wanted the media to capture my brilliant athletic performance , I loved them ; when the media write about my trial itâ€
™ s unfair .
Pistorius brought this all on himself , Nel says .
Nel :
The accusedâ€ ™ s
actions were so grossly unreasonable , he acted so hastily , with such excessive force , that his actions bordered on dolus eventualis .
This wasnâ€ ™ t a road accident or assault , he says , or someone firing blindly .
Pistorius fired into a toilet door â€œwell knowing there was someone thereâ€ � .
Nel says the state is not questioning the judgeâ€ ™ s verdict of culpable homicide , but it does rather sound that way .
He says there are several elements of the case that do not make sense and will remain matters of speculation .
Not to send Pistorius to prison would be paying lip service to the seriousness of the offence , Nel says .
The worst thing you can do is take another personâ€ ™
s
life : there is nothing more serious .
The punishment should acknowledge the sanctity of human life
â€
¦
It demands heavy punishment .
Gerrie Nel continues his argument .
He turns to the shooting : Pistorius was â€œgrossly negligent â€ ¦ bordering on dolus eventualisâ€ � .
The sentence must reflect this .
Pistorius was cleared of murder by dolus eventualis ( that he must have known he was likely to kill the person by firing ) but Nel wants to suggest that the judgeâ€ ™ s sentence should acknowledge that the degree of negligence involved takes the offence very close to a murder conviction .
Barry Roux made repeated references to the principle of ubuntu and in particular a book called UBuntu and the Law .
As this excerpt from the book explains : Ubuntu expresses a conception of humanity and an ethic ( a set of moral and political principles ) which emphasise group solidarity , the interdependence of members of a society , and the interconnected value of human lives in community .
It derives from a Zulu phrase , umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu : a person is a person through other people .
Roux employed it to stress his argument that Pistorius ought to be given the chance to â€œmake goodâ€
�
his crime by giving something back to society .
Sending him to prison would not serve this aim , the defence argues .
Court takes a short break now â€ “ back in 15 minutes .
If the court does not come up with a sentence that satisfies society , society might take matters into its own hands , Nel warns .
Society would lose faith in the courts .
Iâ€ ™ m really trying my utmost not to become emotional in my argument
â€
¦
But every right - thinking person would agree with me that there could be nothing worse than hearing your child died a violent death .
What could be worse than that ?
Iâ€ ™ ve thought about it : nothing .
The deceased did nothing to contribute to her death .
She did nothing .
She died a horrific death â€
¦
She had nowhere to go .
A community sentence is simply not appropriate , Nel goes on .
Should the court sentence him to go home , stay in the â€œluxurious homeâ€ � of his uncle Arnold Pistorius , leaving only to train , play sport , go to a doctor ?
Thatâ€ ™ s what we all do .
And for a few hours a month he will go and do community work , Nel asks .
That is â€œshockingly disproportionateâ€ � to the crime he committed .
Nel turns to mercy .
He understands mercy , he says .
But is the court supposed to apply mercy because Pistorius could have made millions and now can not ?
That can not be an argument , Nel says : he caused it himself .
How much grief and trauma must a parent have endured to be unable to take the stand to talk about the loss of a daughter , Nel asks .
The family will never get over this , he adds .
On the issue of the money paid to Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents , Nel homes in on the word â€œofferâ€ � .
It was an â€œoffer for settlementâ€ � â€ “ not a gift or a token , he says .
Nel adds that he was â€œsaddenedâ€ � that the Steenkamps had needed to accept the R6000 a month from Pistorius because they were financially devastated on top of everything else they had been through .
He notes that the separate settlement offer had been made between judgment and sentencing .
Why not earlier ?
Why not later ?
â€
¦
It was an attempt to influence sentence .
Nel says the testimony of Kim Martin , cousin of Reeva Steenkamp , was the voice not just of her family but of society .
Every mother listening would have felt her pain , he says .
Nel runs through what happened to Reeva Steenkamp .
She was not shot with regular ammunition , but â€œdevastatingâ€ � black talon bullets .
He defends showing the picture of Steenkampâ€ ™ s body to Pistorius : it was important that he and the court saw what he did to her .
Nel :
Society trusts the court to deal with criminals
â€
¦
To be harsh if it has to .
Firing four shots through a locked door into a tiny cubicle , knowing someone is in there
â€ “ society will want to know what the court will do with that person , Nel says .
He wants the court to think about Reeva Steenkamp .
The court has been thinking about Pistorius for months , his disabilities and anxiety .
Barry Roux has come to the end of his argument .
Gerrie Nel is on his feet .
Sentencing is different to the main trial , he says .
Society is involved and must be taken into account .
Roux :
The accused so desperately needed to apologise .
We have pointed out the letters written â€ ¦
We understood the emotions of the parents .
The Steenkampsâ€ ™ lawyer thought it not appropriate to give the letters to the parents .
He can not make it right
but he wants to do something to assist in the healing process
â€ ¦
Itâ€ ™ s a genuine and positive effort .
Pistorius wants to do something good for the community , Roux says .
Serious consideration should be given to a community service as part of that healing process .
Jails are very overcrowded , Roux points out .
Community service helps ease the pressures on prisons .
There are threats against Pistorius should he go to prison , Roux says .
How would preferential treatment help him ?
It would make it worse .
Sending him to prison would smack of retribution .
Correctional supervision and community service is a real punishment , Roux says , but it is restorative : for the good of everyone .
It does not need to be restricted to 16 hours a month , as witnesses this week had proposed .
Roux now turns to evidence from yesterday given by Zac Modise , acting head of correctional services .
Modise conceded that a regular prison wing would not be suitable for Pistorius , Roux says .
But Modise could not give assurances about the hospital section : how would he be protected from diseases ?
Must he stay in hospital and not get involved in outside work ?
It can never be a suitable punishment by locking a person up in a hospital .
Roux says it would be appropriate if Pistorius had deliberately killed Steenkamp and needed to be removed from society .
But his negligence needs to be balanced against his disability and vulnerability .
There needs to be compassion .
Roux reads from mental health reports on Pistorius that concluded he was not aggressive nor a danger to society .
Should Pistorius not receive proper medical care , his condition is likely to worsen and increase the risk of suicide .
Witnesses on the scene of the immediate aftermath of the shooting saw his remorse and distress .
This remorse is genuine , Roux says .
Putting Pistorius in jail â€œwould not be conducive at allâ€ � to helping with his anxiety and depression .
He is suffering post - traumatic stress disorder .
The idea that a prison sentence would be the end to this tragedy is wrong , Roux tells the judge : â€œThere is no â€˜overâ€ ™
.â€ �
The money offered by Pistorius to the parents of Reeva Steenkamp was private and sincere , Roux goes on .
It shows the athlete was prepared to take responsibility for his actions , the lawyer says .
Now the Steenkamps want to return the R6000 Pistorius had been paying them monthly , he does not want that back .
It can go to charity , Roux says .
He wants to make good .
He can never make good .
He wants to make good as far as possible .
Roux turns to Pistoriusâ€ ™ charity work , which Nel was rather cynical about earlier this week .
Lots of sports people do charity work , Roux concedes , but Pistorius went beyond that .
His doctorate from Strathclyde University was not for athletics but for the work he did for others .
Roux :
He lost a person he loved , his self - respect , most of his friends , his career , all his properties , all his money .
Heâ€
™ s lost everything .
Is this a person you must remove from society ?
â€
¦
We say no .
Roux moves on : the false stories heard in court that Reeva Steenkamp was screaming on the night she was killed must have caused anguish to her parents as well as the accused , he argues .
Judge Masipa intervenes .
She is concerned about what the defence has said about the media .
With evidence that has been put before the court , one can weigh and test it , she says .
How can the court tell whether these allegations about the media are true ?
Roux says , factually , the media articles he highlights were false .
But I havenâ€
™ t read those articles , the judge says .
It is a punishment in itself to read in the press that you are a cold - blooded murderer , Roux says .
Masipa says it is important that the court not be influenced by anything that has not properly been put before it .
Roux says it is not the content of the media reports but their effect on Pistorius that he wants her to bear in mind .
The pain for Pistorius of having killed the person he loved will never go away , Roux tells the court : Itâ€ ™ s deep and itâ€ ™ s permanent and it wonâ€ ™ t go away â€ ¦
No punishment can be worse than the last 18 months .
From the beginning , Pistorius told the truth , Roux says : other lawyers criticised the defence team for putting their version out so early , but the athlete insisted on it .
Roux says the parents of Reeva Steenkamp have said they want no vengeance : they are neutral on what the sentence should be and leave it in the hands of the court .
He admires them for this .
Pistorius is a young man , Roux says , 27 at the time of the shooting .
He doesnâ€ ™ t have the wisdom one would have in later years .
On top of this are his disabilities and vulnerabilities .
He is a first - time offender .
He has lost his property and not earned a penny since the shooting .
He has no sponsors now .
He is a person that is down - and - out , he is broken â€ ¦
There is nothing left of this man .
But itâ€ ™ s far worse than that .
When you kill someone , you must live with the consequences , Roux says .
But the consequences in this case were extreme :
The denigration , the humiliation , the ridicule , the blame , the false allegations â€ “ ongoing , worldwide .
Thatâ€ ™ s what he was subjected to .
He stands there , giving evidence and crying , knowing the whole world is watching .
He was absolutely exposed .
Roux :
You can not disregard the actual consequences of the negligence .
Weâ€ ™ re not trying to do that .
It is absolutely tragic .
He cites other cases of culpable homicide in which shots were fired but the perpetrator did not go to jail .
Community sentences have been used in such cases , he tells the court .
Roux cautions the court : the first instinct when something bad happens is to say someone must go to prison .
But is there a fairer way ?
Imprisonment should be a punishment of last resort , he says .
The National Prosecuting Authority painted Pistorius as a cold - blooded murderer and made no apology when he was cleared of murder , the defence lawyer adds .
Roux turns back to ubuntu , humane punishment .
He reminds the judge that she has said the penal system has shifted from retribution to rehabilitation .
Pistorius is crying in the dock now .
Pistorius was treated badly by the prosecution in court , Roux goes on : The accused was forced to look at a photo of the deceased .
He loved her .
He felt horrible about her death .
Horrible .
Thatâ€ ™ s not how we treat an accused .
He was denigrated â€ ¦ a cold - blooded killer .
He has lost everything .
He doesnâ€ ™ t even have money to pay legal expenses .
He has nothing left .
Roux says Pistorius sold his car â€ “ his last asset â€ “ not to help win a lesser sentence , but to try to make good with the Steenkamp family ( he made a financial offer to Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents , which was rejected ) .
Roux says Pistorius â€œnever , everâ€ � considered that it was Steenkamp behind the toilet door .
And yet in the bail application , â€œhe became a premeditated murdererâ€ � .
The media and social media were full of speculation , he says : that Pistorius had â€œcrushedâ€
�
Steenkampâ€ ™ s head ; that he was abusing steroids ; that he was taking acting lessons before appearing in court .
Roux :
There was an accused and a victim â€ ¦ and the accused became a victim .
He was charged and taken to the bail court on a charge of premeditated murder .
There is no doubt the investigating officer gave false evidence .
We have a man who negligently , in an anxious and vulnerable state of mind , killed the woman that he loved .
Sometimes , Roux says , when considering a punishment , â€œwe must just sit back and look again and ask : is that really what the law is
aboutâ€ � .
There are elements of society that would want the death sentence for Pistorius , he says .
But what is actually in the interests of society , taking into account all the facts of the case ?
Roux is talking about the concept of ubuntu , humanity .
He says the punishment should be about giving something back to society : the restorative justice principle .
Roux says , when it comes to sentencing , the judge must consider if there was any â€œdeviousness [ or ] conscious unlawfulness â€ ¦ there was notâ€ � .
Pistorius bears a â€œhigh degree of negligenceâ€ � but the athlete was compromised by his vulnerabilities .
The state will tell you about deterrence and retribution , Roux says .
He refers to the â€œJub Jubâ€ � case â€ “ rapper Molemo â€œJub Jubâ€ � Maarohanye , who was jailed for 10 years for culpable homicide after he killed four children while drag - racing .
The Pistorius case is completely different , he says : in getting in the car , Maarohanye consciously acted unlawfully .
Pistorius did not , he maintains .
Roux reminds the court that Pistorius â€œgenuinely , though erroneouslyâ€ � believed there was an intruder in his house , and that his life â€ “ and that of Steenkamp â€
“ was at risk .
There is no evidence , and nothing in the judgment , to contradict this , he adds .
The judge agreed that he did not subjectively foresee that he would kill the person behind the bathroom door .
Roux starts by telling the court that the loss of a child â€ “
Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents , June and Barry , are in court again today â€ “ is the greatest devastation .
But he wants the court to look at the context of this â€œtragic eventâ€ � .
He says Pistorius has â€œabsolute acceptanceâ€ � of the judgment : the guilty finding on culpable homicide .
Day five of the sentencing hearing starts now .
Defence counsel Barry Roux says the Pistorius team has handed in to the court the written heads of argument but he has not yet seen the state version .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel says he will find it and make it available â€œright nowâ€ � .
Reporters in court in Pretoria say there is so far no sign of the three men involved in yesterdayâ€ ™ s disagreement with the Pistorius family : Mikey Schultz , Jared Mortimer and Marc Batchelor .
Both state and defence teams agreed yesterday â€ “ and assured Judge Masipa â€ “ that closing arguments would be wound up today .
Each needs only to summarise the testimony the court has heard this week â€ “
it isnâ€ ™ t intended to be a re - run of the full trial .
But it seems highly unlikely â€ “ especially as she has the written heads of argument to consider too â€ “ that the judge will hand down a sentence today .
Having previously told the court she was busy with other commitments for the next few weeks , we now understand she has cleared her diary for next week .
The best bet appears to be that she will announce her decision on Tuesday .
Oscar Pistorius has arrived at the court for his sentencing hearing :
Welcome to live coverage of day five of the hearing to determine what sentence Oscar Pistorius will receive for the two charges of which he was found guilty last month : the culpable homicide of Reeva Steenkamp and illegally discharging a firearm in a crowded restaurant .
Thursday saw the last evidence from witnesses , as prosecutor Gerrie Nel brought this part of the proceedings to an early close .
Today will see both state and defence present their final arguments to Judge Thokozile Masipa , who will then take a few days before handing down sentence , probably next Tuesday .
Yesterday also saw Aimee Pistorius , sister of Oscar Pistorius , allegedly threatened in the court room by Mikey Schultz , a self - confessed killer .
He denied swearing at her , calling the Pistorius family â€œa bunch of liarsâ€ � .
A full report on that incident is here .
As David Smith reports : Schultz confessed to shooting dead businessman Brett Kebble in September 2005 but , with two accomplices , escaped prosecution in an immunity deal with the state effectively brokered by Gerrie Nel , now prosecutor in the Pistorius trial .
In other key developments : Defence counsel Barry Roux read out newspaper reports that prison gang leader Khalil Subjee , known as The General , had said he would order â€œa hitâ€ � on Pistorius .
Zach Modise , the acting national commissioner for correctional services , giving evidence for the state , insisted Pistorius would be safe in the countryâ€ ™ s prisons , which he said were the best in Africa .
Roux won a concession from Modise that it would not be suitable to house Pistorius in a general prison wing and he should be guaranteed a placement on a hospital wing .
But the defence raised concerns that there is only one resident doctor for the 7,000 inmates at Kgosi Mampuru prison , where Pistorius would be likely to serve any custodial sentence .
Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s cousin Kim Martin concluded her moving testimony on the effect of the killing on her family , saying Pistorius â€œneeds to pay for what heâ€ ™ s doneâ€ � .
She told the judge : Iâ€ ™ m very fearful of the accused .
I have tried very hard to put him out of my mind .
Weâ€ ™ ve even made a point of not mentioning his name in my house , because I didnâ€ ™ t want to spend any energy thinking about him .
I really believe Mr Pistorius needs to pay for what he has done .
My family are not people who are seeking revenge .
We just feel that to take someoneâ€ ™ s life â€ ¦ needs sufficient punishment .
You can catch up on some key issues in the process here : What sentence could Pistorius receive ?
What sentence is expected ?
The Guardianâ€ ™ s David Smith will be in the courtroom in Pretoria and you can read his tweets @SmithInAfrica .
Iâ€ ™ ll also be tweeting breaking news and key developments @Claire_Phipps .
Davidâ€ ™ s report on Thursdayâ€ ™ s court hearing is here , and yesterdayâ€ ™ s live blog is here .
Todayâ€ ™ s court hearing is due to start at 9.30am South Africa time ( 8.30am BST ) ."
2014-10-17,"Oscar Pistorius is facing possibly his last weekend of freedom for years after a judge set his sentencing for Tuesday and a state prosecutor demanded that he be jailed for 10 years .
If Judge Thokozile Masipa imposes a prison sentence next week , the Olympic and Paralympic sprinter , who has been staying at his uncleâ€ ™ s home since he killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp , will be taken down to holding cells , though he may appeal and reapply for bail .
Masipa last month cleared Pistorius of murder but convicted him of culpable homicide , the South African equivalent of manslaughter .
On Friday , the prosecution and defence teams wrapped up their arguments over what would be a suitable punishment in the interests of retribution , rehabilitation and society .
â€œThe minimum term that society will be happy with will be 10 yearsâ€ ™ imprisonment , â€ �
prosecutor Gerrie Nel told the high court in Pretoria .
â€œThis is a serious matter .
The negligence borders on intent .
Ten years is the minimum.â€ � Nel called a proposed house arrest sentence
â€œshockingly disproportionateâ€ � for what Pistorius did when he shot four times through a locked toilet door in his home , hitting Steenkamp in the head , arm and hip .
â€œThe deceased died in a small cubicle behind a closed door , â€ �
he said .
â€œThree bullets ripped through her body
â€
¦ it must have been horrific.â€
�
Admitting that he was trying not to become emotional , Nel pleaded : â€œWe shouldnâ€ ™ t fail the parents .
We shouldnâ€ ™ t fail society .
Society may lose its trust in the court.â€ � Pistorius cried in the dock during Fridayâ€ ™ s proceedings and was hugged by family members and lawyers at the end .
A trial that has spanned 48 court days of torment , tears and even vomiting under the worldâ€ ™ s gaze is almost at an end .
Nel said he had heard many voices saying â€œplease donâ€
™ t break the accusedâ€ � .
Yet Pistorius had broken an entire family , he added .
Responding to defence arguments that the double amputee athlete had already been punished by negative media coverage , Nel sarcastically parodied their version of events : â€œIâ€ ™ m a victim , feel sorry for me , the media victimised me .
When I wanted the media to capture my brilliant athletic performance , I loved them ; when the media write about my trial , itâ€ ™ s unfair.â€ �
Masipa appeared to side with the prosecution on this point .
â€œYou can take it from me , â€ � she told Nel , referring to the defenceâ€ ™ s argument about the media , â€œall those paragraphs will be disregarded.â€ � Nel also accused Pistorius of using his disability as an excuse .
â€œI find it disturbing that a person who fought to compete with able - bodied athletes now shamelessly uses disability in mitigation , â€ � he said .
He rejected concerns that prison showers do not have rails for the disabled , claiming that he had seen in photos that Pistoriusâ€ ™ s shower in his own home did not have rails .
The prosecutor again criticised the offer of money by Pistorius to the Steenkamp family .
â€œI can not but think this is an attempt to influence , â€ �
he said , adding that they had rejected it as â€œblood
moneyâ€ � .
Earlier , defence counsel Barry Roux said the athlete did not act with â€œdeviousnessâ€ � when he killed Steenkamp .
The court has found that he mistook the 29-year - old model for a dangerous intruder and that the shooting was a tragic accident .
â€œThe accusedâ€ ™ s actions were to some extent dominated by vulnerability and anxiety , â€ � Roux said .
â€œWhen you come to sentence , you have to look at the actions with his frame of mind.â€ �
Roux said there was â€œno conscious unlawfulnessâ€ � from Pistorius and he had already been punished severely for what he did .
â€œThere was an accused and a victim , and the accused became a victim .
He was charged and taken to the bail court on a charge of premeditated murder .
There is no doubt the investigating officer gave false evidence .
â€œHe was denigrated to the extent that all that was left was a rage killer , a cold - blooded killer and everything that was horrible .
No punishment that the court can hand down can be worse than the last 18 months , as he was alone , denigrated.â€ � Roux reminded the court of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s spectacular fall from sporting grace .
â€œHe was an icon in the eyes of South Africans for what he has achieved .
Heâ€
™ s lost everything .
He lost all his sponsors .
He lost all his money .
He has nothing .
There is nothing left of this man .
Heâ€ ™ s not only broke , but heâ€ ™ s broken .
He hasnâ€ ™ t even the money to pay for legal expenses .
He has nothing left.â€
�
Worse than that , Roux continued , he must live with the consequences of killing a person .
â€œThe denigration , the humiliation , the ridicule , the blame , the false allegations are ongoing , worldwide .
Thatâ€ ™ s what he was subjected to .
He stands there , giving evidence and crying , knowing the whole world is watching .
He was absolutely exposed.â€ � Roux made repeated references to the principle of ubuntu , and a book titled uBuntu and the Law .
Ubuntu derives from a Zulu phrase , umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu : a person is a person through other people .
Some South Africans on Twitter accused the Afrikaner lawyer of using the concept in a blatant attempt to impress a Zulu judge .
Roux entreated : â€œHe wants to make good as far as possible .
Serious regard should be given to a community - based sentence so something good can come out of this.â€
�
The defence and prosecution were summing up four days of testimony at the end of the sentencing hearing .
The judge said court would resume at 9.30am on Tuesday , when she will pronounce sentence and bring the seven - month trial to an end ."
2014-10-20,"South Africa ’s president , Jacob Zuma , has criticised Oscar Pistorius ’s defence team for arguing the Paralympian should be spared prison because he is disabled and “ has money
” .
Zuma ’s first public comments about the most closely watched trial in the country ’s post - apartheid history came as Pistorius , convicted of culpable homicide for the killing of Reeva Steenkamp , awaits sentencing on Tuesday .
Pistorius ’s lawyers called expert witnesses last week to testify that South African jails are ill - equipped for disabled people because , for example , the showers lack handrails .
His lawyer warned that even in a hospital section the athlete would be exposed to diseases .
“
I ’m not sure why that comes into the picture , ” Zuma told the Guardian in Pretoria .
“
They were taking that too far in my view .
There are people who are [ physically ] challenged in prisons ; it ’s not an issue here .
That brings an unfortunate thing , an added thing , because a man has money .
”
The president added : “ I thought that was an unfortunate debate .
You do n’t need it , because there are people who are disabled who are in prison .
Why it is raised as if he was the first one to be convicted ?
I thought they were pushing it too far .
”
Zuma , a former inmate on Robben Island during white minority rule , said he was saddened by the fall of Pistorius –
“ a hero in a very special way ,
” –
but felt the trial had shown the strength of the judicial system .
“ Very fair , very open .
Not just to other people but even to South Africans , because usually South Africans are not informed .
This time around , in their own houses they were informed as to how things happen .
”
He also backed judge Thokozile Masipa , whose decision to clear the double amputee athlete of murder was widely attacked .
“
The fact that the judge says he ’s acquitted of murder , but on culpable homicide convicted , teaches people I think something in law , that you do n’t just say because the life was lost
it ’s a murder , ” he said .
“
It could be murder , it could be an unintended kind of thing .
I think people must have learned .
“
The judge was under a bit of criticism , particularly because she ’s a woman and women felt that she was not sympathetic to women , but she ’s applying the law .
So I ’m just saying it was an interesting lesson for us .
”
Masipa will decide in the high court in Pretoria on Tuesday whether to meet the prosecution ’s demand for 10 years’ imprisonment , grant the defence ’s request for house arrest and community service , or seek a middle ground .
Either side could then appeal and prolong the case yet further .
The sentencing hearing last week focused scrutiny on South Africa ’s ability to cope with disabled people in jails notorious for overcrowding , tuberculosis , violent gangs and allegations of torture .
Zach Modise , the acting national commissioner of the department of correctional services , told the court that it deals with 128 disabled prisoners on a daily basis , some of whom are blind , paraplegic or have had limbs partially or totally amputated .
“
In the continent of Africa , there are no better facilities than those that we have in our country , ” he said , adding that he had also visited facilities in the UK and New York ’s
Sing Sing maximum security jail and found South Africa compared favourably .
He gave assurances that Pistorius would be held in a hospital section to cater for his specific needs .
But watchdogs have raised concerns .
Ruth Hopkins , an investigative journalist at the Johannesburg - based Wits Justice Project , visited the hospital section of Pretoria ’s Kgosi Mampuru II prison two years ago , where the athlete is likely to be sent .
“
I did see a number of inmates cleaning but it did seem quite rundown and understaffed , ” she said .
“
The general problem with the department of correctional services is that the legal framework is very robust and impressive but in practice it ’s a whole different ballgame .
However , I do n’t think Oscar Pistorius will run into a lot of problems because he has a name and connections and network and most importantly money .
Most of the cases we investigate are poor people who lack money or the ability to navigate the criminal justice system .
”
Golden Miles Bhudu , who spent five months in jail in 2009 , recalled seeing an inmate without legs forced to help himself get meals and left in the sun all day because he was unable to pay fellow prisoners .
“
The conditions for disabled people leave a hell of a lot to be desired , ” said Bhudu , now a spokesman for the South African Prisoners’ Organisation for Human Rights .
“
It all depends how well connected outside and how rich you are .
It will be difficult if it ’s you or me and no one knows us .
But Oscar Pistorius is a millionaire .
He will have to pay a protection fee to prisoners and some corrupt correctional officers to look after him .
Some officers will run to him to offer care and protection .
”
Meanwhile , on the eve of sentencing , Pistorius ’s siblings have spoken publicly about their anguish and unwavering support for the athlete .
His sister , Aimee , recalled the moment that she learned 29-year - old Steenkamp had been shot .
“
When I first heard what had happened obviously my initial reaction was just shock and devastation and extreme heartache , ” she told ITV News .
“
My first thoughts were that knowing my brother , … the kind of person he is … he must have thought it was an intruder , before I knew the facts .
”
She added : “ I do not doubt my brother at all .
I have the privileged position of knowing my brother – his strengths , his faults as you do when you ’re as close as we are .
And yet knowing those things , I know that people who think maliciously are so far from the truth .
”
The family have been seen shaking their heads in court while listening to prosecutor Gerrie Nel .
Pistorius ’s brother , Carl , said : “ I ca n’t relate to the Oscar that ’s been portrayed by the prosecution .
Oscar growing up , up until now , is the same person .
He ’s bold
, he ’s brave , he ’s got courage , he ’s got charisma , he ’s exciting and fun , thoughtful and intelligent , and has been the perfect fit as a middle child between us three siblings .
“
I believe Oscar without a reservation .
There ’s not an inkling of reservation as to what I believe Oscar says …
We can not speculate ahead of final sentencing but what I do know for certain , regardless of the outcome , the three of us will stand together and continue to stand together . ”"
2014-10-21,"The International Paralympic Committee has ruled that Oscar Pistorius will not be allowed to return to competition until 2019 after he was sentenced to five years in prison for shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp .
An IPC spokesman confirmed that Pistorius , the first athlete to compete in both the Olympics and Paralympics in London in 2012 , would be banned from the Rio Games even if he had been released on licence by that point .
The athleteâ€ ™ s counsel said following sentencing that he could serve as little as 10 months in prison before completing the rest of his sentence under house arrest .
But the IPC said that under its rules he would be banned from competition for the full five years unless he appealed and his sentence was formally reduced .
His family have said there will not be any appeal .
â€œThe rules state that if someone is given a five - year sentence by a court , they must serve that sentence before returning to competition ,
â€ � an IPC spokesman told the Guardian .
The 27-year - old South African will be 33 by the time of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics in 2020 but it is debatable whether he will be in any shape to compete by then .
There will also be a question mark over whether he will be able to travel freely to some countries having been convicted of culpable homicide .
The athleteâ€ ™ s future on the track has been the subject of much conjecture throughout his lengthy trial and sentencing .
The South African Olympic Committee said in the wake of his conviction that he would be free to compete again once out of prison because its regulations did not bar anyone with a criminal record , a stance the IPC then appeared to endorse .
But the IPC president , Sir Philip Craven , then told the Guardian that no decision had been taken and that no decision would be taken until he was formally sentenced .
Pistorius became a poster boy for the Paralympic movement in the run - up to London 2012 .
It is hoped that the conclusion of the high - profile trial will allow the IPC to move on and focus instead on the other stars created by the breakthrough London Games .
Privately , there may be some relief that the run - up to the Rio Olympics will not be dominated by a debate over whether Pistorius will compete or not .
In a statement , the International Olympic Committee added : â€˜We take note of the courtâ€ ™ s decision .
This is a human tragedy for the family of Reeva Steenkamp and also for Oscar Pistorius .
We hope very much that time will bring comfort to all those concerned but at this stage we have no further comment to make.â€ �"
2014-10-21,"Day 1 : 3 March 2014
The start of the trial .
Oscar Pistorius denied the premeditated murder of his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , at his Pretoria home in the early hours of 14 February 2013 .
Pistorius pleaded not guilty to the murder and to firearms charges , telling the court he denies the allegations of murder â€œin the strongest termsâ€ � and believed an intruder had broken into his house and was in his bathroom when he fired .
A witness told the trial that she heard â€œbloodcurdling screamsâ€ � on the night the Paralympian shot his girlfriend dead .
The witness , Michelle Burger , told the court she heard two people â€ “ a man and a woman
â€ “ shouting , adding : â€œThe fear in that womanâ€ ™ s voice ; you only fear like that if your life is threatened.â€ �
Burger said she heard four gunshots on the night in question .
Pistorius said he approached the bathroom with a gun in an effort to protect Steenkamp and accused the prosecution of trying to use inadmissible evidence for the â€œassassination of my characterâ€ � , adding that suggestions he deliberately killed Steenkamp â€œcould not be further from the truthâ€ � .
Day 1 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 2 : 4 March 2013 Charl Johnson , a neighbour of the athlete , told the court he heard screams and four consecutive shots on the night in question .
He said he had assumed that neighbours were being robbed , and had been surprised to learn the next day that Pistorius had shot Steenkamp .
Johnson said that after realising how close their house was to the crime scene , he and his wife had chosen to speak to a lawyer rather than the police as they wanted to keep out of the public eye .
Another witness , Johnsonâ€ ™ s wife , Michelle Burger , again insisted that she heard the screams of a woman , rather than an anguished man .
She rejected defence claims that the loud noises she heard coming from Pistoriusâ€ ™ s house were the sound of him using a cricket bat to smash down the door of the bathroom .
Burger disputed claims that she used her husbandâ€ ™ s witness statement as a template for her own and denied basing her evidence on â€œretrospective knowledgeâ€ � gleaned from later media coverage .
The defence also sought to question Burgerâ€ ™ s evidence by arguing that Steenkamp would have been too severely injured by gunshots to have been able to scream .
Another neighbour , Estelle van der Merwe , told the court she woke to hear an argument and four noises â€ “ which could have been gunshots â€ “ on the night Steenkamp died .
The judge reminded the media not to publish any images of witnesses after a TV channel and several papers carried a still photograph of one witness .
Day 2 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 3 : 5 March 2013
Along with the murder of Steenkamp , Pistorius also faced three firearms charges .
Professional boxer Kevin Lerena , a friend of Pistorius , said the sprinter accidentally fired a gun in a restaurant and asked his friend to take the blame , in a separate firearms related charge .
Jason and Maris Loupis , from the restaurant , said the group Pistorius was in was apologetic and left soon after the incident .
Chief defence lawyer Barry Roux sought to undermine the prosecution testimony of Michelle Burger and Charl Johnson , neighbours of Pistorius on the Silver Woods estate , who say they heard screams before shots were fired on the night the athlete fatally shot his girlfriend .
Roux argued that similarities in the Burgerâ€ ™ s and Johnsonâ€ ™ s accounts indicated that they had conferred over their answers , which Johnson denied .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said Johnsonâ€ ™ s telephone number had been read out in court a day earlier by Roux and he had received a â€œlarge amountâ€ � of calls and a threat which said : â€œWhy are you lying in court ?
You know Oscar didnâ€ ™ t kill Reeva .
Itâ€ ™ s not cool.â€
� Day 3 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 4 : 6 March 2014
The defenceâ€ ™ s Barry Roux asked witness Charl Johnson about the discrepancies between his first and second accounts of the events on the night of the shooting .
Roux suggested that the sounds Johnson heard after screams were Pistoriusâ€ ™ s cricket bat breaking down his bathroom door , and not gunshots .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel and Roux both questioned witness Johan Stipp , Pistoriusâ€ ™ s
neighbour and a doctor , about his recollection of the sequence of events on the night of the shooting .
Stippâ€ ™ s said he heard gunshots and screams from his bedroom .
Roux suggested that Pistorius , anxious and distressed , could have produced the screams that Stipp identified as female .
Day 4 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 5 : 7 March 2014 Defence lawyer Barry Roux and prosecutor Gerrie Nel questioned Pistoriusâ€ ™ s ex - girlfriend , Samantha Taylor , who spoke about her experience of his use of firearms and the sound of his screams .
Court was adjourned twice after Taylor broke down in tears , when Roux asked her about the end of her relationship with Pistorius .
Witness Pieter Baba , a security guard on duty the night of Steenkampâ€ ™ s death , testified what he saw and heard from neighbours and in Pistoriusâ€ ™ s house after the gunshots were fired .
Baba said that Pistorius tearfully told him â€œeverything is fineâ€ � after neighbours reported hearing gunshots fired in Pistoriusâ€ ™ s house .
Day 5 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 6 : 10 March 2014 Judge Thokozile Masipa blocked live tweeting and broadcasting of the testimony of Gert Saayman , who conducted the autopsy on Steenkamp .
Masipa said Saaymanâ€ ™ s testimony would have an â€œexplicitly graphic natureâ€ � and should not be shown around the world .
The forensic pathologist said Pistorius had used an expanding bullet designed to cause maximum tissue damage when he opened fire through a locked toilet door .
Pistorius was bent double in the dock , hands on his ears as if trying to block out the words , and violently sick .
Day 7 : 11 March 2014
The court heard more details of the charges that Pistorius fired a gun through a car sunroof in November 2012 and in a crowded restaurant in January 2013 : Pistorius was said to have clashed with a police officer who picked up his firearm , telling him , â€œYou canâ€ ™ t just touch another manâ€ ™ s
gun.â€ �
Soon after , he fired the weapon through the roof of a car in which he was travelling and laughed about it , his former friend Darren Fresco testified .
Fresco described another shooting incident in a restaurant in Johannesburg in January 2013 .
He said he handed his gun , a Glock 27 .40-calibre
pistol , under the table to Pistorius .
But the gun went off .
â€œInstantly he passed the weapon back to me , under the table , and he said , â€˜Please , thereâ€ ™ s too much media hype around me at the moment , please can you take
the rap?â€ ™ â€ � he said .
â€œBeing a friend I said I would , with pleasure.â€ � State pathologist Gert Saayman said food in Steenkampâ€ ™ s stomach suggested she had eaten at about 1 am , two hours before she died , raising questions over Pistoriusâ€ ™ s testimony that the couple went to bed at 10 pm .
Day 8 : 12 March 2014 A forensic expert said Pistorius was not wearing his prosthetic legs , as he claimed , when he beat down his bathroom door with a cricket bat after shooting Reeva Steenkamp .
Johannes Gerhard Vermeulen said if he had been on his prostheses , the position at which he broke through the door would have been â€œunnatural and uncomfortableâ€ � .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s defence lawyer said the athlete would have been unable to balance on his stumps while using the bat .
Vermeulen did endorse Pistoriusâ€ ™ s account that the shooting through the door came before the bat was used .
The prosecution confirmed it accepted Pistoriusâ€ ™ s claim that he was not on his prostheses when he fired the shots that killed Steenkamp .
Day 9 : 13 March 2014 Gruesome images of Steenkamp shortly after her death were inadvertently shown to the packed courtroom , causing Pistorius to vomit and horrifying her supporters in the public gallery .
The photographs flashed up briefly on several TV screens as a police official flicked through images on a computer showing scenes from inside Pistoriusâ€ ™ s house .
Day 10 : 14 March 2014 Police photographs of a bare - chested Pistorius standing on blood - stained prosthetic legs and wearing shorts covered in blood , taken shortly after the athlete fatally shot his girlfriend , were shown to the court .
A damning portrait of South African police was painted , as the defence claimed two luxury wristwatches worth thousands of pounds went missing from the athleteâ€ ™ s bedroom on the day he was arrested .
Former police colonel
Schoombie van Rensburg said he saw a ballistics expert at the scene examining without gloves the firearm used to kill Steenkamp .
Day 11 : 17 March 2014 Sean Rens , manager of a firearms training academy south of Johannesburg , told the court that Pistorius â€œhad a great love and enthusiasmâ€ � for firearms .
Licensing examination records reveal that Pistorius knew the countryâ€ ™ s gun laws well .
He achieved top marks in competency tests , which included a question about whether he could fire at burglars stealing a television from his house .
Pistorius wrote : â€œNo .
Life is not in danger.â€ �
Rens also recalled an incident when Pistorius told him he thought there was an intruder in his home : â€œHe went into what we call â€˜code redâ€ ™ , or combat mode , in other words to draw his gun and go and clear his house .
When he came to the source of the noise , it was the laundry or something.â€ � Pistorius had tweeted about the incident in November 2012 :
â€œNothing like getting home to hear the washing machine on and thinking its an intruder to go into full combat recon mode into the pantry!â€
�
Steenkampâ€ ™ s mother June attended the trial for the first time since its opening day .
She was greeted by Pistorius and acknowledged him with a nod ; Pistoriusâ€ ™ s sister Aimee also walked over to speak to her .
Day 12 : 18 March 2014 Police captain
Chris Mangena said Pistorius was standing on his stumps nearly three metres from a locked toilet door when he opened fire and killed his girlfriend .
Mangena testified that , of the four bullets fired , one had missed Steenkamp and ricocheted off a wall before hitting another wall in the cubicle .
The other three hit her .
Day 13 :
19 March 2014 Police ballistics expert Chris Mangena said Steenkamp was standing in a toilet cubicle facing the locked door when she was hit in the right hip by the first of the four bullets .
Steenkamp then slumped into a â€œseated or semi - seated positionâ€ � on top of a magazine rack .
The second bullet missed her and ricocheted off the wall , bruising her back .
Steenkamp was hit in her right arm and in the head by the third and fourth shots .
She collapsed with her head on the toilet seat .
He also described the impact of the type of bullets in Pistoriusâ€ ™ s gun , which were designed to cause maximum damage .
â€œIt hits the target , it opens up , it creates six talons , and these talons are sharp .
It cuts through the organs of a human being.â€ � Pistorius looked at pornographic and car websites on his iPad in the hours before he shot and killed Steenkamp .
Day 14 : 24 March 2014 Police mobile phone expert Francois Moller read out WhatsApp messages between Steenkamp and Pistorius , in which she told her boyfriend : â€œYou have picked on me excessively â€
¦
I do everything to make you happy and you do everything to throw tantrums .
Iâ€
™ m scared of you sometimes and how you snap at me and of how you will react to me .
You make me happy 90 % of the time
and I think we are amazing together
â€ ¦
Iâ€ ™ m the girl who fell in love with you but Iâ€ ™ m also the girl who gets side - stepped when you are in a shit mood
â€
¦ I get snapped at and told my accent and voices are annoying.â€ �
Despite the evidence of a volatile relationship , Moller said : â€œNinety percent [ of all the messages ] were normal conversations and loving conversations.â€ � Anette Stipp , a neighbour of Pistorius , testified that she heard gunshots , the â€œterrified , terrifiedâ€ � screams of a woman and then a second set of gunshots on the night of the shooting .
Day 15 : 25 March 2014
The state finished its case .
Prosecution witness Colonel Gerhard Vermeulen was recalled by the defence to answer questions about a â€œnewâ€ � mark at the top of the toilet door and admitted he had not checked it against the cricket bat used by Pistorius .
The prosecution detailed calls made to and from Pistoriusâ€ ™ phones on the night of Steenkampâ€ ™ s death , which showed that after alerting security guards and the ambulance service he rang his friend , his brother and his manager .
An expert witness agreed that a call to Pistoriusâ€ ™ own voicemail had probably been made accidentally .
Police warrant officer Adriaan Maritz told the court the police computer system had no record of Pistorius ever reporting a crime or being the victim of one , as both sides tried to paint a picture of Pistoriusâ€ ™ fear ( or otherwise ) of being attacked in his home .
Texts and WhatsApp exchanges between the couple were read to the court , and CCTV images of the pair showed them kissing as they shopped for groceries .
The defence said that of over 1,700 messages , the prosecution had found only four that showed rows .

Day 17 : 7 April 2014
The defence opened its case and Pistorius took to the witness stand .
He began with a tearful , broken - voiced apology to the family and friends of Steenkamp , saying there is â€œnot a momentâ€ � when he does not think about her family , and prays for them daily .
He added : â€œIâ€ ™ ve tried to put my words on paper many times to write to you but no words would ever sufficeâ€
�
Pistorius said he had taken anti - depressants and sleeping pills since the shooting , often waking with â€œterrible nightmaresâ€ � .
He said he often calls his sister to sit with him during the night .
He said his religious faith was the only thing to sustain him over the past year : â€œThere have been times when Iâ€ ™ ve just been struggling a lot .
My God is a God of refuge.â€ � Pistorius spoke at length about his fear about , and experience of , crime .
He said his his mother was worried about intruders and kept a pistol under her pillow .
He said a speedboat accident in 2009 which almost killed him left him fearful and withdrawn .
The first defence witness was pathologist Professor Jan Botha , who questioned prosecution evidence that Steenkamp must have eaten about two hours before her death at 3 am .
Pistorius spent much of this evidence with his hands over his face , retching .
Day 17 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 18 : 8 April 2014
The court adjourned early after the defence said Pistorius was too emotional to continue his testimony .
Pistorius said he grabbed the gun he always kept under the bed when he heard a noise in the night .
He was terrified that intruders had come into the house and shouted for Steenkamp to call the police .
He said he heard a noise from inside the toilet .
â€œBefore I knew it I had fired four shots at the door.â€ �
He broke down as he described finding Steenkamp inside the bathroom , not breathing .
The athlete removed his prosthetic legs in court and stood by the toilet door , which had been brought to the court room to demonstrate the shooting .
He denied ever firing a gun through a car sunroof , and said the incident in which a firearm he was holding went off in a restaurant was an accident .
Day 18 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 19 : 9 April 2014 Pistorius was cross - examined by state prosecutor Gerrie Nel .
Pistorius was shown a photograph of his dead girlfriend , with Nel telling him : â€œYou shot and killed her .
Wonâ€
™ t you take responsibility for that?â€
�
In tears , the athlete replied : â€œI donâ€ ™ t have to look at a picture , I was there.â€ �
As the prosecutor tore holes in the defence version of events , Pistorius told the judge : â€œMy memory isnâ€ ™ t very good at the moment .
Iâ€ ™ m under a lot of pressure sitting here .
Itâ€ ™ s not easy .
Iâ€ ™ m defending for my life.â€
�
He described the moment he fired the gun : â€œBefore thinking , out of fear , I fired four shot â€ ¦
I didnâ€ ™ t intend to shoot anyone .
I fired my firearm before I could think , before I even had a moment to comprehend what was happening .
I believed someone was coming out the toilet.â€ � Nel showed a video of Pistorius firing a gun at a watermelon and saying off - camera : â€œItâ€ ™ s a lot softer than brains .
But â€ ¦ itâ€ ™ s like a zombie stopper.â€
� Day 19 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 20 : 10 April 2014 Pistorius continued to face ferocious cross - examination from Nel .
He admitted that he had â€œno reasonâ€ � to fire the shots that killed Steenkamp , as Nel told him : â€œYour version is so improbable , that nobody would ever think itâ€ ™ s reasonably , possibly true , itâ€ ™ s
so impossible â€ ¦
Your version is a lie.â€ � Nel said the phrase â€œI love
youâ€ � appeared only twice in WhatsApp messages from Steenkamp and , on both occasions , they were written to her mother : â€œNever to you and you never to her.â€ � Day 20
: live coverage as it happened .
Day 21 : 11 April 2014 Pistorius asserted that when he entered the bathroom he shouted to Steenkamp to call the police , so Nel demanded to know why she did not respond , describing it as the â€œmost
improbableâ€ � part of his story .
Nel alleged that the couple had an argument and Steenkamp fled to the toilet pursued by Pistorius .
â€œShe wasnâ€ ™ t scared of an intruder .
She was scared of you.â€ � Pistorius insisted that Steenkamp did not scream when the bullets hit her .
Pistorius , who repeatedly rubbed eyes that looked sore , said : â€œIâ€ ™ m tired , my lady.â€ �
The judge told him : â€œSo if you are tired and the reason you are making all these mistakes is because you are tired , you must say so.â€ � The court adjourned early .
Day 21 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 22
: 14 April 2014 Pistorius saw his fourth day of bruising cross - examination .
Nel accused the defendant of deliberately breaking down into tearful histrionics to avoid difficult questions .
Pistorius wept as he recalled shouting at the presumed intruder :
â€œGet the fuck out of my house !
Get the fuck out of my house!â€ �
Nel told him : â€œYou fired at Reeva .
These other versions can not work : you fired at her , you did .
Why are you getting emotional
now?â€ �
Pistorius wailed through tears : â€œI did not fire at Reeva!â€ �
The prosecutor accused Pistorius of changing his defence from putative self - defence to involuntary action , when the athlete said he had not had time to think before firing his gun .
Day 22 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 23 : 15 April 2014 The cross - examination of Pistorius came to an end and he was re - examined by Roux : Pistorius was asked about a Valentineâ€ ™ s card that Steenkamp had intended to give him on 14 February 2013 , the day she died .
He told the court : â€œThe envelope says â€˜Ozzieâ€ ™ , with some hearts and a squiggle , and then it says on the front of the card : â€˜Roses are red , violets are blueâ€ ™ .
Then on the inside she wrote the date on the left , then on the right she said : â€˜I think today is a good day to tell you that â€ ¦ I love you.â€ ™ â€ � Nel summed up the stateâ€ ™ s case , saying that Steenkamp ate around two hours before her death , when the couple had an argument that was heard by a neighbour .
She locked herself in the toilet and screamed .
Pistorius then took his pistol and fired through the door as the two talked , even changing his aim when she fell backwards .
Pistorius remained vague on whether he consciously pulled the trigger in self - defence or if it went off involuntarily .
â€œI
didnâ€
™ t think about pulling the trigger , â€ � he said .
â€œAs soon as I heard the noise
, I pulled the trigger.â€ �
He also stood in the middle of the court re - enacting the moment he struck the toilet door with a cricket bat to reach Steenkamp .
He said he was â€œheartbrokenâ€ � when he first saw Steenkampâ€ ™ s body .
Day 23 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 24
: 16 April 2014 Roger Dixon , an expert witness for Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ s defence , was accused of â€œirresponsibilityâ€ � after admitting he was not trained in ballistics , light , sound or blood spatter evidence and was not present at Steenkampâ€ ™ s postmortem .
Dixon presented a different order of the shots that killed Steenkamp and claimed that a bruise on her right buttock was caused by her falling back on a magazine rack , contradicting the finding of state pathologist Gert Saayman .
Day 25 : 17 April 2014 Nel assailed Dixon again over a test he conducted to see if Pistoriusâ€ ™ s head and body could have seen by neighbours through a bathroom window on the night of the killing .
Dixon admitted using a man on his knees who was 20 cm shorter than the double amputee athlete on his stumps .
Day 26 : 5 May 2014
After a two - week break , the defence picked up its case with two witnesses who were first on the scene after Pistorius shot Steenkamp :
Johan Stander and his daughter Carice Viljoen .
The defence queried why â€ “ despite being interviewed as witnesses for the state â€ “ neither were called by the prosecution .
Stander revealed details of the call Pistorius made to him immediately after the shooting : â€œJohan , please , please , come to my house , please .
I shot Reeva .
I thought she was an intruder .
Please , please come quick.â€ �
Both testified that they had arrived at Pistoriusâ€ ™ house to find him carrying a bleeding Steenkamp down the stairs and that the athlete was crying , screaming and begging for help .
Both Stander and Viljoen gave evidence of several people â€ “ neighbours , friends , police in uniform and civilian clothes
â€ “ entering and leaving the house .
Viljoen said nobody was controlling who came and went .
The defence alleges that crucial evidence in Pistoriusâ€ ™ bedroom was tampered with by police officers .
Stander , who had been on the management committee for the estate , recounted several instances of breaking - and - entering crimesthere , including via a ladder .
Nel insisted the estate was a safe place to live .
Day 26 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 27 : 6 May 2014
The court heard from three of Pistoriusâ€ ™ closest neighbours , none of whom were called by the state .
The three witnesses all heard a man crying on the night Steenkamp was shot and that it was a â€œhigh - pitched cryâ€ � .
The defence claims that prosecution witnesses who previously told the court they heard a womanâ€ ™
s
scream had in fact heard Pistorius , who it says screams like a woman when distressed .
Michael Nhlengethwa said the manâ€ ™ s cry was â€œvery
highâ€ � .
The two female witnesses , Eontle Nhlengethwa and Rika Motshuane , were asked by the defence to replicate the cry they heard that night .
Each made a high - pitched , anguished scream .
All three testified that they did not hear a woman screaming .
Michael Nhlengethwa told the court Pistorius introduced Steenkamp to him as â€œmy fiancÃ
© eâ€ � days before she was killed and said he would be moving to Johannesburg to be closer to her .
Pistorius was later accused of trying to intimidate Kim Myers , a friend of Reeva Steenkamp who was in court , by asking : â€œHow can you sleep at night?â€ �
He denied the accusation .
Day 27 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 28 : 8 May 2014 Ballistics expert Thomas â€˜Wollieâ€ ™ Wolmarans , told the court that the ammunition used to shoot Steenkamp was not Black Talon bullets , as previously heard , but ranger bullets .
The â€œmushroomâ€ �
effect on flesh is the same .
Tests he carried out on wood splintering indicate Steenkamp was very close behind the door when she was shot .
Social worker and probation officer Yvette Van Schalkwyk was a late addition to the witness list , coming forward only on Tuesday to dispute allegations that Pistorius was â€œputting on a showâ€ � with his emotional outbursts in court .
The social worker was assigned to support Pistorius from his earliest court appearances .
But Nel argued he was sorry only for himself , and not for what he had done .
Anaesthetist Professor Christina Lundgren cast doubt on the stateâ€ ™ s claims that Reeva Steenkamp must have eaten no more than two hours before her death , claiming that gastric emptying was â€œnot an exact scienceâ€ � .
She described the post - mortem report that concluded Steenkamp had eaten at 1 am or later as â€œpurely speculativeâ€ � .
Day 28 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 29 : 9 May 2014 Wolmarans continued his evidence , testifying that Steenkamp was standing close behind the toilet door when the first two bullets hit her hip and arm , and was falling as she was hit by a subsequent bullet that caused her head wound .
He said an injury to Steenkampâ€ ™ s back was not caused by a ricochet bullet , as the state argues , but occurred when she fell backwards on to a wooden magazine rack , claiming : the stateâ€ ™ s version
â€œdoesnâ€ ™ t make senseâ€ � .
After decibel tests to ascertain whether a cricket bat striking the door could be mistaken for gunshots , Wolmarans concluded the sounds of the cricket bat and gunshots were very similar .
But this evidence was undermined by Wolmaransâ€ ™ insistence that he was not a sound expert and references to his hearing loss and tinnitus .
Nel queried Wolmaransâ€ ™ assertion that the bullets used to shoot Steenkamp were not black talons , as had been previously reported , but ranger bullets .
Captain Mangena , the state ballistic expert , maintains the bullets were Black Talons .
Pistorius did not dispute this when he gave his evidence .
Day 29 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 30 : 12 May 2014
A dramatic day , as the prosecution announced that it would ask that Pistorius undergo a mental health assessment at a state hospital .
The surprising move came after defence witness and forensic psychiatrist Dr Merryll Vorster said Pistorius suffered from generalised anxiety disorder at the time of the shooting , and a depressive disorder following it .
The anxiety disorder â€ “ which stemmed from surgery at the age of 11 months to remove his lower legs â€
“ could make Pistorius a danger to society , she said .
Barry Roux said the defence would oppose the application â€ “ to be made under section 78 of the Criminal Procedure Act â€ “ and said the athleteâ€ ™ s diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder did not mean he was incapable of distinguishing right from wrong .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s physical vulnerability made him more anxious , said Vorster .
Since childhood , Pistorius was encouraged not to see himself as disabled , which meant he was unable to access the emotional support he needed , Vorster said .
His anxiety disorder left him â€œhypervigilantâ€ � about his personal safety .
His mother , who died when Pistorius was 14 , slept with a firearm under her pillow and had an irrational fear of intruders .
Day 30 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 31 : 13 May 2014
The state made a formal application to have Pistorius sent to a mental health hospital for 30 days for evaluation .
Making the application , Nel said the court had no choice but to refer Pistorius .
But Nel said the state did not make the case that Pistorius was mentally ill .
The court is obliged to â€œact decisivelyâ€ � because of the evidence of the defenceâ€ ™ s psychiatrist , Dr Merryll Vorster , who diagnosed him with generalised anxiety disorder , which might have affected his actions on the night he shot Steenkamp .
If the court chooses not to refer , it could have a bearing on a future appeal .
The defence strongly opposed the application , with Roux describing the prosecution move as â€œa ruseâ€ � .
There were no grounds to support the allegation that generalised anxiety disorder is a mental illness .
Nel said the defence had wanted to use the diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder as â€œa fall - back optionâ€ � after Pistorius performed poorly in the witness box .
Day 31 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 32 : 14 May 2014 Judge Masipa ruled that Pistorius must be referred for psychiatric evaluation following evidence that his actions may have been affected by an anxiety disorder .
Masipa said the lay court was â€œill - equippedâ€ � to decide whether the diagnosis ought to be taken into account , and referring Pistorius for psychiatric tests would ensure a fair trial .
Day 32 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 33 : 20 May 2014 Judge Masipa set out the terms of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s mental health evaluation , agreed with both state and defence in advance .
Pistorius would spend 30 days as an outpatient at Weskoppies state psychiatric hospital in Pretoria , beginning on Monday 26 May , attending every weekday between 9 am and 4 pm
The trial was adjourned until 30 June .
Day 33 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 34
: 30 June 2014 The report from a panel of mental health experts concluded that Pistorius was not suffering from a â€œmental disorder or defectâ€ � when he shot Reeva Steenkamp , and was not incapable of telling right from wrong , or of acting on that understanding of right and wrong .
The court did not hear if the psychiatrists support the diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder .
But the panel did conclude the athlete suffers from post - traumatic stress disorder and depression .
Defence acoustics expert Ivan Lin said screams from the locked toilet were â€˜unlikelyâ€ ™ to be heard in neighboursâ€ ™ bedrooms 177 m away , contradicting testimony from a state witness .
He said it was not always possible to tell whether a scream was made by a man or a woman .
The surgeon who amputated Pistoriusâ€ ™ legs as a baby said the athlete would be â€œseverely impairedâ€ � in a dangerous situation , and would be unable to flee if on his stumps .
The judge was asked to examine Pistorius on his stumps in the courtroom ; this was not filmed .
Judge Masipa has said she is â€œvery
unhappyâ€
� at the stateâ€ ™ s failure to produce an electrical cord that was in Pistoriusâ€ ™ bedroom on the night of the shooting .
The cord appeared in police photographs but was not listed on an inventory of items removed from the house .
Day 34 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 35 : 1 July 2014 Pistoriusâ€ ™ manager , Peet van Zyl , told the court that the athlete had asked that event organisers arrange for Steenkamp to accompany him on two of his athletics trips .
He had never asked this of any other girlfriend .
Nel cited a report that a room - mate of Pistorius at the London 2012 Paralympic games asked to move because the athlete was constantly on the phone arguing .
Van Zyl said he had seen Pistorius lose his temper only twice , in the face of â€œabusiveâ€ � questioning from journalists .
Pistorius was due to retire from athletics in 2017 , but his financial position was very strong after his performance in London in 2012 .
Day 35 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 36 : 2 July 2014 The report by Weskoppies
hospitalâ€ ™ s lead
psychologist Jonathan Scholtz concluded that Pistorius has been severely traumatised by the events of 14 February 2013 , suffering depression and post - traumatic stress disorder , and â€œhis condition is likely to worsenâ€ � if he does not continue mental health treatment , leading to an increased risk of suicide .
There is no evidence of narcissism , psychopathy , abnormal aggression or explosive anger , and his relationship with Reeva Steenkamp shows no evidence of abuse .
But the report says Pistorius does not meet the requirements for a diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder .
Professor Wayne Derman , sports physician for the South African national teams , testified to the high levels of stress he had recorded in Pistorius , compared with other elite disabled athletes .
Disabled individuals can have an â€œexaggeratedâ€ � fight - or - flight response , he said .
Peet Van Zyl , Pistoriusâ€ ™ manager , was challenged over claims that Steenkamp was the first girlfriend invited to accompany Pistorius to overseas athletics events .
The prosecution alleged that Pistorius had attempted to take a previous partner , Samantha Taylor , to the London 2012 Olympics .
Day 36 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 37 : 3 July 2014 The defence revealed more details of the psychological profile , which concluded that Pistorius has a split personality that has led to the formation of â€œtwo Oscarsâ€ � â€ “ one a vulnerable and fearful person with a disability , the other a confident Olympic hero .
Day 38 : 7 July 2014 Nel quizzed sports physician Wayne Derman about Pistoriusâ€ ™ mobility when on his stumps â€ “ but a video showing the athlete re - enacting his version of how he shot Steenkamp then carried her from the bathroom was not mentioned in court .
The Australian TV channel that aired the footage insisted it did not believe it was obtained illegally .
Day 38 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 39 : 8 July 2014
The defence rests its case .
Barry Roux , lead counsel for Pistorius , said the defence had had to abandon efforts to get some witnesses to testify , because they did not want their voices broadcast â€œaround the worldâ€ � .
Day 39 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 40 : 7 August 2014 The court heard closing arguments by the prosecution .
Fetching the gun and walking down the corridor to the bathroom with it showed premeditation , the state claimed .
Nel said Pistorius was an â€œappalling witnessâ€ � whose testimony had been â€œdevoid of truthâ€ � , vague , argumentative and mendacious .
He did not have an anxiety disorder but â€œanxiety on - callâ€ � .
The prosecutor highlighted what he called significant incongruities in the defence case , arguing that conflicting evidence about the position of fans and a duvet in the accusedâ€ ™ s bedroom proved Pistorius was tailoring his evidence to mask the fact that he knew it was Steenkamp in the toilet cubicle when he fired four shots through the door .
There is no proof the police tampered with the crime scene , Nel said .
The position of items in the bedroom means Pistoriusâ€ ™ version can not be true .
Regardless of who was behind the door , Pistorius is guilty of murder , Nel argued .
Whether Pistorius believed the person behind the door was an intruder or knew it was Steenkamp , it was murder by dolus directus ( premeditated murder ) or dolus eventualis ( that he must have known he was likely to kill the person by firing ) .
He meant to fire and he aimed at the person in the cubicle .
Nel insisted Pistorius knew it was Steenkamp .
She was facing the door when he fired directly at her â€ “ not wild shooting , but a â€œgood groupingâ€ � of four shots .
He said WhatsApp messages between the pair show they were having problems , with Steenkamp saying she was â€œscaredâ€ � of her boyfriend .
The prosecution contended that the pair were arguing .
A witness says she heard a row , another saw the bathroom light on andSteenkampâ€ ™ s stomach contents indicate she was awake and eating several hours after Pistorius said they had gone to sleep .
State witnesses who said they heard a woman showed â€œextraordinary corroborationâ€ � in their independent statements to police .
Witnesses also heard â€œinterminglingâ€ � screams of a man and a woman .
The other charges faced , and denied , by Pistorius show a pattern of behaviour in which the athlete acts recklessly and does not take responsibility for his actions , the state argued .
Day 40 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 41 : 8 August 2014
The defence wrapped up its final arguments and Judge Masipa announced that she would deliver her verdict on 11 September .
Barry Roux compared Pistoriusâ€ ™ years of disability to an abused women who snaps and kills her husband .
Questioned by the judge , Roux said the shooting was a reflexive action after a â€œslow burnâ€ � of vulnerabilities led to a point at which he had â€œhad enoughâ€ � .
Roux says the trial should have begun with a charge of culpable homicide rather than murder .
The defence said Pistorius should be acquitted .
If the firing of the gun was purely reflexive , he lacked criminal capacity ; if there was a thought process , it was â€œputative private defenceâ€ � ( self - defence ) because he believed he was in danger .
He had no motive to kill Steenkamp .
The defence took the court in detail through the timeline of events in an attempt to prove the stateâ€ ™ s version â€ “ in which the fatal shots were fired at 3.17am â€ “ could not be true .
The defence said the noises heard at 3.17am were the thuds of the cricket bat , which means the screams heard before 3.17am were made by the accused , not by Steenkamp , who was already fatally wounded .
Roux accused state witnesses of lying to the court and alleged that police had disturbed the scene .
Roux said Pistorius should be found guilty of a separate charge of negligently discharging a firearm in a restaurant .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said Pistoriusâ€ ™ two defences â€ “ putative self - defence and that he fired involuntarily â€ “ were not just mutually exclusive but mutually destructive .
Day 41 : live coverage as it happened .
The case for the state and the defence â€ “ in summary .
Day 42 : 11 September 2014 Judge Masipa , in the first day of her judgment , effectively ruled out the possibility that Pistorius would be found guilty of murder .
The judge said the state had failed to prove premeditated murder and the evidence was â€œpurely circumstantialâ€ � .
He will also not be found guilty of murder without premeditation ( dolus eventualis ) , as Masipa says there was not sufficient evidence to suggest that he had foreseen that his actions could result in the death of the person behind the toilet door .
Nonetheless , Masipa said it was clear that Pistorius had acted unlawfully in shooting the person behind the door .
A reasonable person would not have fired four shots into the toilet cubicle , because he would have foreseen the consequences : that somebody could be killed .
Pistorius acted â€œtoo hastily and used excessive force â€ ¦
It is clear his conduct was
negligent.â€ �
But the judge adjourned the hearing for the day before delivering what many observers in and outside the court expected to be a guilty verdict on the charge of culpable homicide ( manslaughter ) .
More detail of the judgment , which explain the judgeâ€ ™ s conclusions , is here , and a summary of key quotes from the judge is here .
Day 42 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 43 : 12 September 2014 Oscar Pistorius was found guilty of culpable homicide for shooting dead Reeva Steenkamp .
But he was formally cleared of charges of murder â€ “ premeditated or not .
Despite objections from the state , Judge Thokozile Masipa agreed with an application by the defence to extend bail for Pistorius until sentencing on 13 October .
Masipa found Pistorius not guilty of two further firearms charges : that he fired a gun through a car sunroof , and that he was in possession of illegal ammunition .
But he was found guilty of negligently discharging a loaded gun in a crowded restaurant just weeks before he shot Steenkamp .
In a statement made in court after the verdicts , Arnold Pistorius , the athleteâ€ ™ s uncle , said the judgment had lifted â€œa big burdenâ€ � from the family , but insisted there were â€œno victors â€ ¦ in this devastating tragedyâ€ � .
The International Paralympic Committee said Pistorius would be allowed to compete in future sporting events .
South Africaâ€ ™ s National Prosecuting Authority said it was â€œdisappointedâ€
� by the verdicts .
Day 43 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 44 : 13 October 2014
The beginning of the sentencing hearing , and five days of arguments in mitigation and aggravation from defence and state .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s defence team called three witnesses to testify in mitigation of sentencing .
Social worker Joel Maringa told the court that he recommended Pistorius undergo house arrest for three years , with 16 hours ofcommunity service a month .
The stateâ€ ™ s Gerrie Nel called this suggestion â€œshockingly inappropriateâ€ � .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s psychologist and manager painted the picture of a broken man who is nonetheless humble and charitable , and who poses no danger to society .
Day 44 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 45 : 14 October 2014 Defence witness Peet van Zyl , Pistoriusâ€ ™ s manager , concluded his time on the stand after being grilled by state prosecutor Gerrie Nel about whether Pistoriusâ€ ™ s charity work was really as selfless as van Zyl made out .
The defence called its final witness , social worker Annette Vergeer , the second witness to recommend that Pistorius be sentenced to three yearsâ€ ™ home arrest with community service rather than a jail term .
Vergeer said she believed that Pistorius would be at risk in a South African prison , as he was â€œvulnerableâ€ �
and they were ill - equipped to deal with disabled inmates .
It emerged that Pistorius has been paying the family of Reeva Steenkamp around Â£338 per month since the month after the shooting , but they intend to pay back â€œevery centâ€ � .
Day 45 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 46
: 15 October 2014 Kim Martin , a cousin of Reeva Steenkamp , took to the stand to be â€œReevaâ€ ™ s voiceâ€ � , after the victimâ€ ™ s parents , June and Barry Steenkamp , decided they could not give testimony .
Martin told the court about her cousin , who she said was a hard worker , a fun - loving and nurturing person , who supported her parents financially .
She said the loss of her cousin had â€˜ruined our whole familyâ€ ™ .
After breaking her back in a horse - riding accident after studying for a law degree , Steenkamp had pursued a modelling career because â€˜life can be over so quicklyâ€ ™ .
Lawyers for June and Barry Steenkamp clarified details of the payments made to them by Oscar Pistorius .
They say the R6000 monthly payments will be repaid and the Steenkamps will not pursue a civil claim .
Barry Roux told the court that his client did not want the money back .
Nel sought to undermine the picture painted by defence witnesses of a violent , overcrowded prison system .
There was not â€œthe slightest possibilityâ€ � that Pistoriusâ€ ™ s prostheses would be confiscated , he told the court .
The Department of Correctional Services issued a statement calling the defence claims â€œinaccurateâ€ � .
Day 46 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 47 : 16 October 2014 Aimee Pistorius , sister of the athlete , was allegedly threatened in the court room by Mikey Schultz , a self - confessed killer .
He denied swearing at her , calling the Pistorius family â€œa bunch of liarsâ€ � .
Zac Modise , acting national head of corrections services , agreed with the defence that it would not be suitable to house Pistorius in a general prison wing and he should be guaranteed a placement on a hospital wing .
Threats have been made against Pistorius by gang leaders inside prison , the defence argued .
Modise argued that South African jails are the best in Africa .
Steenkampâ€ ™ s cousin Kim Martin concluded her testimony on the effect of the killing on her family , saying Pistorius â€œneeds to pay for what heâ€ ™ s
doneâ€ � .
Day 47 : live coverage as it happened .
Day 48
: 17 October 2014 The defence and the state concluded their arguments in mitigation and aggravation of sentence .
The defence argued : Pistorius should not be sent to prison because he is also a victim .
His true sentence has been the loss of the woman he loved .
Negative media coverage and lurid speculation on social media â€ “ which Judge Masipa said she would not take into account â€ “ as well as the prosecutionâ€ ™ s treatment of Pistorius in court , had left him a broken man .
The judge should apply the principle of ubuntu , humane punishment , in allowing Pistorius to â€œmake goodâ€ � by doing something for society .
The money he paid to the parents of Reeva Steenkamp shows he wants to take responsibility .
A community service can be appropriate .
Sending Pistorius to prison , where he might not get proper medical care , could increase his risk of suicide and compromise the care he needs for his disabilities .
Pistorius â€œabsolutelyâ€ � accepts the verdict of culpable homicide but his negligence in killing Reeva Steenkamp was born out of agenuine , if erroneous , belief that his life was at risk .
The state argued : Pistorius must go to prison for at least 10 years .
Any sentence should acknowledge that the degree of negligence involved made the offence very close to murder .
A community sentence would be â€œshockingly disproportionateâ€ � .
Pistorius has â€œshamelesslyâ€ � used his disability as an excuse and wants the court to think of him , not Steenkamp , as the victim in this case .
The state does not believe he has shown remorse .
The court has had months of hearing and thinking about Oscar Pistorius .
It now needs to think about Reeva Steenkamp and her family .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s offer of a financial settlement to Steenkampâ€
™ s
parents was â€œan attempt to influence sentenceâ€ � .
It is not the business of the court to worry about conditions in prison : Pistorius can be catered for .
Day 48 : live coverage as it happened .
Now everything rests in the hands of Judge Masipa , who returns to court on Tuesday morning to hand down sentence on Oscar Pistorius .
Day 49
: 21 October 2014 Judge Thokozile Masipa tells Pistorius he must serve a five - year prison sentence for the culpable homicide of Reeva Steenkamp .
She also handed down a three - year sentence for negligently discharging a firearm in a crowded restaurant , wholly suspended and to be served concurrently .
There are disputed claims about how long the athlete will serve in prison , with the defence team indicating it expected him to be considered for house arrest after 10 months , and the National Prosecuting Authority insisting he must serve a minimum of one - third in jail : 20 months .
Pistorius left court in a police van for prison , expected to be Kgosi Mampuru II prison , formerly Pretoria Central , where it is anticipated he will be housed in the hospital wing .
In a statement read by Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ s uncle , Arnold Pistorius , the family said it accepted the judgment : â€œOscar will embrace this opportunity to pay back to society â€ ¦
As a family we are ready to support and guide Oscar as he serves his sentence.â€
� Day 49 : live coverage as it happened ."
2014-10-21,"Oscar Pistorius was guilty .
However gripped by anger , itâ€ ™ s difficult to accept he didnâ€
™ t know whom he was likely to kill .
He had a violent history and his claim that he thought he was shooting a burglar stretches credulity .
He killed his girlfriend .
Given the leniency South African courts used to show towards white people killing black people , it is hard to see how the court could show leniency to a white person killing another white person .
That said , Judge Thokozile Masipaâ€ ™ s argument for a light sentence of five years was meticulously reasoned .
In Britain there is a tendency to lock away famous people just to make an example of them .
South African justice has shown a sort of maturity .
Beyond the cause of consistency , imprisoning Pistorius can serve no purpose .
The judge said she did not want to â€œsend the wrong messageâ€ � , a phrase repeated by a thousand judges , but what did she mean ?
The purpose of depriving wrongdoers of their liberty , now that we no longer hang or flog , should be to rehabilitate them and , if not , keep them from further crime .
That it should be â€œretributiveâ€ � , a mere expression of societyâ€ ™ s rage , is primitive theology .
It is trotted out when no other reason for imprisonment can be imagined .
Imprisonment is brutalism , reflecting societyâ€ ™ s inability to police antisocial acts .
The community needs to be protected from those who â€œcannot stop themselvesâ€
� from harming it .
But that is a tiny minority of prisoners .
Most are locked away in fortresses because we can think of nothing else to do with them .
We have admitted defeat .
It is as archaic a response to crime as bleeding and leeches once were to sickness .
Men such as Pistorius have had their lives ruined , their failings exposed and chance enough to reflect on their crimes and what they can do to atone for them .
No one will be more or less â€œdeterredâ€ � by the length of his jail sentence .
Finding why he behaved as he did , and working to prevent others doing likewise , would be the most useful outcome of his crime .
That is unlikely to happen in a prison .
Moving down the road to penal reform can hardly begin with a privileged celebrity .
But to ask , again and again in such cases , what sensible purpose comes from imprisonment , might at least encourage debate .
This month alone the British parliament indulged its regular urge to â€œget
toughâ€ � , with a demand for longer sentences for knife crime , gun crime , fraud and even fly - tipping .
This is not mature legislating but kneejerk retaliation .
It is back to the days of an eye for an eye ."
2014-10-21,"The last the world saw of Oscar Pistorius on Tuesday was a sombre figure , still wearing suit and tie , under police guard in the back of an armoured vehicle as he was transported to Kgosi Mampuru II prison in Pretoria .
It was left to the imagination what fate awaited the disgraced Paralympian as he prepared to have fingerprints taken , don an orange jumpsuit and spend his first night behind bars at the start of a five - year jail term for killing his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp .
The sentence was handed down by the high court judge Thokozile Masipa , bringing an enthralling and exhausting 49-day trial to an end .
Steenkampâ€ ™ s mother , June , said justice had been served .
When it was put to her that , a sixth of the way into his sentence , after only 10 months , Pistorius would be eligible to apply to serve the rest under house arrest , she replied : â€œIt doesnâ€
™ t matter .
Heâ€
™ s going to pay something.â€ �
Steenkampâ€ ™ s father , Barry , added : â€œWe are satisfied.â€ �
But the prospect of an early release caused a fierce backlash on social media and among campaigners against gender violence , with many arguing that Pistorius should have been convicted of murder instead of culpable homicide , the equivalent of manslaughter .
The double - amputee athlete killed 29-year - old Steenkamp by shooting four times through a locked toilet door on Valentineâ€ ™ s day last year after mistaking her for an intruder .
Even so , the hopes of the â€œBlade Runnerâ€ � and his supporters that he could be spared prison altogether and resume his lucrative sporting career were dashed when Masipa sat on the court dais for the last time and pronounced sentence .
â€œMr Pistorius , please rise , â€ �
she told him .
The 27-year - old stood rigid , jaw muscles clenched , hands folded in front of him , and stared straight ahead .
Behind , in the public gallery , his sister Aimee held a hand to her forehead , while his father Henke , who says the ordeal has brought them closer together following a long estrangement , betrayed little emotion .
â€œThe following is what I consider to be a sentence that is fair and just both to society and to the accused , â€ � Masipa said .
â€œCount one , culpable homicide : the sentence imposed is a maximum imprisonment of five years.â€
�
For a trial that has seen sobbing , vomiting and much melodrama , the reaction from both families to the climactic moment was muted and stoical .
But when Masipa finished , Pistorius was quietly tearful .
He stepped out of the dock , leaving behind four white roses from a well - wisher and his green sick bucket .
He clasped the hands of family members , passing his designer watch to an uncle for safe keeping .
There were a few consoling words .
Then the hero of the 2012 London Olympics was led by a police officer down a bleak staircase to the holding cells .
He descended 23 steps , one of them badly chipped , with a handrail whose paint was scratched and , in the gloomy basement , walked through a plain wooden door .
About an hour later , Pistorius emerged with a clutch of police officers who escorted him past the cameras to an armoured vehicle and Kgosi Mampuru II prison .
Formerly Pretoria Central , the jail was once notorious for hanging apartheid - era political prisoners .
At present 7,000 inmates endure overcrowding , gang violence and unsanitary conditions , but Pistorius was expected to undergo an immediate assessment to be detained in the hospital area .
In an hour - long ruling , judge Masipa said she had striven for a prison sentence that was neither too light nor too severe .
â€œI am of the view that a non - custodial sentence would send a wrong message to the community , â€ � she told the court .
â€œOn the other hand , a long sentence would not be appropriate either , as it would lack the element of mercy.â€ �
The judge said house arrest and community service â€ “ proposed by two defence witnesses in mitigation â€ “ would not be appropriate for Pistorius , who had been guilty of â€œgross negligenceâ€ � .
She said : â€œUsing a lethal weapon , a loaded firearm , the accused fired not one , but four shots into the door .
The toilet was a small cubicle and there was no room for escape for the person behind the door.â€ �
Masipa said she had no reason to believe that South Africaâ€ ™ s prisons would not be able to cater for the needs of a disabled person .
â€œYes , the accused is vulnerable , but he also has excellent coping skills.â€ �
Perhaps anticipating criticism that she has been too lenient on Pistorius because of his celebrity , the judge noted : â€œIt would be a sad day for this country if an impression was created that there is one law for the poor and disadvantaged and another for the rich and famous.â€ �
She also said pointedly : â€œSociety can not always get what they want .
Courts do not exist for a popularity contest but only to dispense justice â€ ¦ The general public may not even know the difference between punishment and vengeance.â€ � Family and friends of Steenkamp , a model and law graduate , wore pictures of her face on their lapels .
Masipa described her as â€œyoung , vivacious and full of life â€ ¦ a promising young woman who cared deeply for family , who was full of hope for the future , and lived life to the full.â€ �
Masipa continued : â€œThe loss of life can not be reversed .
Nothing I do or say today can reverse what happened to the deceased and to her family .
Hopefully this sentence shall provide some sort of closure to the family â€ ¦ so they can move on with their lives.â€ �
But gender activists condemned the outcome .
Rachel Jewkes , director of gender and health research at the South African Medical Research Council , said : â€œI was appalled when I heard the sentence.â€ �
She described it as an opportunity â€œvery tragically missedâ€ � , adding : â€œThis incredibly short sentence for the killing of Reeva Steenkamp is another example of the lives and the career and the future of a man being valued over that of a woman who he has killed.â€ � Pistorius was also given a three - year sentence , suspended for five years , for a firearms offence when a gun went off in a restaurant .
Pistorius would not appeal , he added .
â€œThe court has now handed its sentence , and we accept the courtâ€ ™ s ruling .
Oscar will embrace this opportunity to pay back to society â€
¦
I hope Oscar will start his own healing process as he now treads the path of restoration .
As a family , we will support and guide Oscar as serves his sentence.â€ � South Africaâ€ ™ s national prosecuting authority has two weeks to decide whether to appeal against the verdict or the sentence .
A spokesman , Nathi Mncube , said : â€œWe have stated that we were disappointed with the judgment but we take solace in fact that Pistorius will serve time in jail.â€ �"
2014-10-21,"Oscar Pistorius will spend his first day behind bars on Tuesday after he was sentenced to five yearsâ€ ™ jail for killing his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp .
Looking distressed , the Paralympian clasped the hands of family members as a police officer led him from the dock down 23 steps â€ “ paint peeling off the handrail â€ “ to holding cells below the high court in Pretoria , the capital of South Africa .
The national prosecuting authority said Pistorius , 27 , would go to prison immediately and would be eligible to be considered for parole after serving a third of his sentence .
His uncle , Arnold Pistorius , indicated the sprinter would not appeal .
The amputee athlete , known as the â€œBlade Runnerâ€ � , stood staring straight ahead as judge Thokozile Masipa announced his sentence for culpable homicide .
There was a muted reaction from the families on the front bench of the public gallery after a trial that has otherwise provided high emotion and drama .
Masipa rejected many of the defence teamâ€ ™ s arguments and described the evidence of one of their witnesses , social worker Annette Vergeer , as â€œslapdash and disappointingâ€ � .
She said she had no reason to believe that South Africaâ€ ™ s prisons would not be able to cater for the needs of a disabled person such as Pistorius .
â€œIt would be a sad day for this country if an impression was created that there is one law for the poor and disadvantaged and another for the rich and famous , â€ � she noted .
Masipa said a judge must strive for a sentence â€œneither too light nor too severeâ€ � , ruling that â€œa non - custodial sentence will send a wrong message to the communityâ€ � .
Referring to the Steenkamp family , the judge said : â€œNothing I do or say today can reverse what happened to the deceased or her family on 14 February 2013â€
� ,
but she hopes her judgment would provide some form of closure .
Steenkampâ€ ™ s father , Barry , said afterwards : â€œIâ€ ™ m pleased that itâ€ ™ s
over.â€ �
The Steenkampsâ€ ™ lawyer , Dup de Bruyn , told Agence France - Presse that the sentence would probably be served as two years in prison and three years under house arrest .
â€œIn effect , he gets three yearsâ€ ™ correctional supervision and two yearsâ€ ™ direct imprisonment.â€ �
De Bruyn said Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents were satisfied with the decision .
â€œThey feel itâ€ ™ s
right.â€ � Pistorius killed Steenkamp , 29 , in the early hours of Valentineâ€ ™ s Day last year when he shot her through the bathroom door at his home in Pretoria .
He insisted he thought he was firing at an intruder .
Pistorius was also given a three year sentence , suspended for five years , for a firearms offence .
Prisonâ€ ™ s grim record The Pretoria prison in which Oscar Pistorius will spend at least the next 10 months counts among its more illustrious alumni the South African short - story master Herman Charles Bosman , who was sent there in 1926 after shooting and killing his stepbrother .
Like Pistorius , Bosman claimed it was an accident , but Bosman was convicted of murder and only escaped death row after a reprieve .
His resulting prison memoir , Cold Stone Jug , was described by Doris Lessing as â€œthe saddest of all prison booksâ€
� .
Today Kgosi Mampuru , previously known as Pretoria Central Prison , but renamed to honour a Bapedi chief hanged there in 1883 after being convicted of murder , public violence and revolt , is home to Clive Derby - Lewis and Janusz Walus , convicted of the 1993 assassination of the ANC leader Chris Hani .
Derby - Lewis has twice been attacked by other inmates , most recently in March this year .
His lawyer said at the time : â€œIt is safer to go to war than to be in the Kgosi Mampuru prisonâ€ � .
Pistorius may hope his experience is more similar to that of the Waterkloof Two , Frikkie du Preez and Christoph Bekker , who were sent to the prison after being convicted of killing a homeless man in 2001 .
A video of the two emerged earlier this year that appeared to show them drinking alcohol and using mobile phones and computers in their cell , prompting a public outcry and forcing an investigation by Correctional Services .
Inmates at Kgosi Mampuru have already told the South African newspaper
The Times that a mobile phone was waiting for Pistorius .
One prisoner said they had been following his trial on TV using mobile satellite devices , and that the athlete would be protected by his fame and money .

2014-10-23,"Oscar Pistorius has reached â€œthe end of the roadâ€ � after his trial and imprisonment , and is unlikely to run for his country again , the South African government has said .
The Paralympian , convicted of killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp , began a five - year jail sentence on Tuesday .
He is expected to be granted an early release , possibly after 10 months , but Fikile Mbalula , the South African sports minister , said he believes Pistoriusâ€ ™ s track career is over .
â€œI do not think Oscar will be able to come back in terms of athletics ,
â€ �
Mbalula told the Cape Argus newspaper .
â€œFor me , [ Pistoriusâ€ ™ s conviction and sentence ] was the end of the road of his journey .
It is unfortunate that it had to end in this manner , but the courts have spoken and we will respect their decision.â€ �
When Pistorius was convicted of culpable homicide last month , the South African Olympic committee indicated he would be free to compete again once out of jail because its regulations do not bar anyone with a criminal record .
But this week the International Paralympic Committee said that , under its rules , he would be banned from competition for the full five years unless he appealed and his sentence was formally reduced .
Mbalula said the â€œBlade Runnerâ€ ™ sâ€ � sentencing â€œhas been a very sad moment for us in sport , in the sense that he was the epitome of wisdom , skill and triumph over adversity .
Doors were beginning to open for us globally because of this young man .
The last national anthem played at the London Paralympics was that of South Africa because Oscar took the podium after winning the eventâ€ ™ s final race .
In the world of athletics , Oscar was number two , second only to Usain Bolt , in terms of popularity.â€ �
The high court in Pretoria heard how Pistoriusâ€ ™ s star was ascendent at the time of the shooting , with sponsorship and endorsement deals likely to increase five - fold after he became the first amputee to compete on an Olympic track .
All have since been terminated .
Instead the sprinter was incarcerated at the Kgosi Mampuru II prison in Pretoria on Tuesday .
He had a medical exam before being locked in his cell in the hospital wing , joining eight other prisoners with disabilities under routine 24-hour observation , with two nurses on duty .
The correctional services department declined to comment on a media report that Pistorius cried himself to sleep on his first night behind bars .
South Africaâ€ ™ s Times newspaper quoted an unnamed source saying : â€œYou could hear him .
Shortly after the door closed you could hear the tears
â€
¦ he was torn up .
Broken .
The crying went on and on .
We think he stopped when he fell asleep .
It was really bad.â€ �
The court accepted Pistoriusâ€ ™ s testimony that he mistook Steenkamp , a 29-year - old law graduate and model , for a burglar when he shot four times through a locked toilet door .
His family have said the athlete will not appeal against his sentence .
Steenkampâ€ ™ s mother , June , told Hello !
magazine :
â€œWeâ€ ™ re not looking for vengeance or for him to get hurt ; weâ€ ™ re just happy because heâ€ ™ s going to be punished for what heâ€ ™ s done.â€ �"
2014-10-27,"Prosecutors will appeal the verdict and sentencing of Oscar Pistorius , officials have said , raising the prospect that his conviction for culpable homicide could yet be upgraded to murder .
Nathi Mncube , a spokesman for South Africaâ€ ™ s national prosecuting authority , wrote on Twitter : â€œOscar Pistorius judgment , NPA will be appealing both the conviction and sentence.â€ �
Mncube said the next step is to file papers in court , adding : â€œThe appeal on conviction is based on the question of law.â€ � There was a public outcry when Judge Thokozile Masipa found Pistorius guilty of culpable homicide â€ “ the South African equivalent of manslaughter â€ “ for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentineâ€ ™ s day last year .
She said there was no reason to doubt the Paralympianâ€ ™ s claim that he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder and did not intend to kill anyone when he shot four times through a locked toilet door .
Anger intensified last week , including among campaigners against gender violence , when Masipa sentenced Pistorius to five years in prison , especially because he could be eligible to switch from jail to house arrest after just 10 months .
The womenâ€ ™ s league of the governing African National Congress said at the time : â€œIt is the organisationâ€ ™ s view that an appeal is in the interests of justice , as well as to send a strong message to the public that crimes against women should carry the maximum penalty .
â€œWe hold that regardless of who Mr Pistorius believed to be behind the bathroom door that fateful night , he shot to kill and therefore a murder did occur.â€
�
It is thought that the state will argue Masipa misinterpreted the law around dolus eventualis murder , which means a perpetrator objectively foresees the possibility of his act causing death and persists regardless of the consequences .
She ruled that this did not apply to Pistorius , although he was grossly negligent .
Weekend reports in South Africa suggested that the chief prosecutor , Gerrie Nel , is gearing up for round two .
The Sunday Times said he would meet NPA head Mxolisi Nxasana on Monday .
â€œNel has already consulted outside legal experts , â€ � the paper noted , adding that an appeal process would be scheduled to start on 3 November .
An appeal by the state against a verdict can only be made on a matter of law and does not involve a retrial or the submission of any new evidence .
It is assumed the case will be heard by the supreme court of appeal in Bloemfontein in Free State province .
The Sunday Times also claimed that Pistorius , 27 , received preferential treatment on his arrival in the hospital section of the prison in Pretoria last week , including meetings with the prison head , prison chaplain and a psychologist .
It reported that his cell measures about 3 metres by 3.5 metres ( 9 ft 10 in by 11 ft 5 in ) and has a single bed , toilet and basin .
Unlike other prison beds , which have sponge mattresses , those in the hospital section have spring mattresses .
Meanwhile , South Africaâ€ ™ s City Press newspaper said the double amputee is broke and still owes his lawyers 10 m rand ( Â£565,800 ) .
His legal team has been representing him free of charge for at least two months , the paper added .
It is not clear if the team will work on the appeal ."
2014-11-20,"Oscar Pistorius being sentenced to five years in jail helped Mail Online set a new daily traffic record in October .
The Daily Mail website reported almost 14.4 million unique browsers on 21 October â€ “ 2.3 million higher than the daily October average .
It was the day the South African Paralympic champion was sentenced following the long - running trial in which he was found guilty of the manslaughter of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp .

2014-11-23,"There has never been a criminal trial like it .
From the moment Oscar Pistorius , the sci - fi athlete , shot and killed his model girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , on the morning of Valentineâ€ ™ s Day in 2013 , it became irresistible rolling news .
For the first time in South African history , a trial would be shown , from opening statements to verdict , on live TV .
A cable channel soon offered 24-hour coverage and analysis .
And , unlike the OJ Simpson case in 1995 , social media stepped in with round - the - clock bloviating by everyone from experts to Donald Trump .
June Steenkamp , Reevaâ€ ™ s mother , remembers that as Pistorius took the witness stand there was rapt silence in the courtroom ; the only sound was journalists tapping on their screens .
Part of the appeal was superficial : Pistorius , handsome and charismatic , and Steenkamp , an FHM cover star and aspiring reality - TV star , were a glam couple ( though only of three monthsâ€ ™ standing ) and her demise suggested perhaps a jealous crime of passion .
But there was deeper intrigue , too : the case prompted discussion of the astonishing murder rate in South Africa , and particularly what appeared to be a culture of acceptance of violence by men against wives and girlfriends .
What really fuelled debate , and charged our imaginations , however , was that , for all the phone records and Whatsapp messages the court trawled through , Pistorius alone knew whether he actually meant to kill Steenkamp .
This unknown â€ “ and the complexity of separating the signal from a year - and - a - halfâ€ ™ s noise â€ “ makes the Pistorius - Steenkamp story a compelling one for book treatment .
Publishers seem to agree .
First out of the blocks , in September , was Oscar :
an Accident Waiting to Happen ( Kindle only ) , co - written by Patricia Taylor , whose daughter Sam dated Pistorius for two ( apparently ) tumultuous years .
Now , with the benefit of a few weeksâ€ ™ further reflection , there are three more .
Behind the Door by Mandy Weiner and Barry Bateman ( Macmillan , 576pp , Â£16.99 ) could confidently claim to be the most comprehensive account of the trial .
At 550-plus pages of dense print , including a grisly photo section and floorplan of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s bedroom and bathroom , it is doggedly ordered and authoritative .
Parts are satisfyingly encyclopaedic , but at times the detail is distracting : when Pistorius shoots Steenkamp , the narrative power dissipates in a fiddly discussion of the dark - wood magazine rack â€œpacked with glossy titlesâ€ � next to the toilet , or the aluminium and glass stand outside that showcased more than 40 pairs of Oakley sunglasses .
Bateman , a broadcaster for South Africaâ€ ™ s Eyewitness News , acknowledges that he leans towards â€œdry , hard - fact accounts of eventsâ€ � , and credits Weiner , his colleague and the author of a book on Johannesburgâ€ ™ s underworld , with softening that impulse .
Still , Behind the Door might have benefited from more style , less substance .
The strongest of the accounts in this respect â€ “ and the best at supplying a context for what unfolded â€ “ is John Carlinâ€ ™ s
Chase Your Shadow : the Trials of Oscar Pistorius ( Atlantic , 384pp , Â£17.99 ) .
Carlin , a fine journalist , is clearly aware of the filmic potential of the tale ; apparently , he was nudged to write the book by Paul Greengrass , director of the Bourne films .
Carlin has previous here , too â€ “ his book Playing the Enemy : Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation was turned into Invictus by Clint Eastwood â€
“ and his recreation of that Valentineâ€ ™ s Day morning
has the pace and energy of a movie script earmarked for , say , Channing Tatum and Jennifer Lawrence .
Carlin makes a smart , convincing case that there are â€œtwo Oscarsâ€ � and that , in this respect , Pistorius is a faithful reflection of South Africa in 2014 , a country that is the â€œundisputed global championâ€ � of rape and violent crime against women and where 45 people are murdered every day .
â€œThere were two South Africas , â€ �
Carlin concludes .
â€œOne was uplifting ; the other was frightening .
One was made up of people who were unusually polite , who were generous , indomitable , forgiving and brave ; the other of people who were reckless , volatile , violent , hot - headed.â€ �
What neither book offers is a view on Pistoriusâ€ ™ s innocence or guilt .
This is left to June Steenkamp in Reeva : A Motherâ€ ™ s Story ( Sphere , 288pp , Â£14.99 ) .
The Steenkamps have not always been sympathetically portrayed in the media , maybe because they have demanded money for interviews .
( The family still struggles financially : shortly before she died , Reeva transferred Â£60 to her parents so they could watch her new reality show on cable TV . )
But June Steenkampâ€ ™ s book is no lightweight , hastily conceived cash - in but a forthright and endearingly honest account .
Early on , she raises the possibility that the couple had a terrible row and he violently lost his temper , â€œbecause he shot her not just once , but bang , bang , bang , bang with 9 mm bullets until she was
deadâ€ � . June Steenkamp claims not to hate Pistorius ; she barely knows him .
She spoke to him just once : one day , Reeva called from the car as Pistorius drove at 160 mph and her mother , a tough Lancastrian , scolded him , â€œIf you hurt my baby , Iâ€ ™ ll have you wiped out.â€ � When Pistorius testified , June Steenkamp sat forward in her seat , eager and , she says , open - minded to see if he could convince her .
It didnâ€ ™ t happen .
Pistorius will have another chance to display contrition when he publishes his own book , which , predictably , his agent has announced is already taking shape .

2014-12-09,"You can read the report on todayâ€ ™ s developments by my colleague David Smith in Pretoria here .
Prosecutors have argued that Judge Thokozile Masipa â€ “ who acquitted Oscar Pistorius of murder and sentenced him to five years for the culpable homicide of Reeva Steenkamp â€ “ must allow an appeal against her findings .
State prosecutor Gerrie Nel said the court had erred in its application of the principles of dolus eventualis , because the accused should have known that firing four shots through the door would result in death , even if he did not â€œwish the resultâ€ � .
Pistorius should have been found guilty of murder .
Itâ€ ™ s inconceivable that he had any intention other than to kill that person or accepted that he may .
It is an erroneous application of dolus eventualis .
Nel said the five - year sentence imposed was â€œshockingly inappropriateâ€ � and a different court would be likely to impose a harsher punishment :
The sentence for what the accused did is inappropriate .
It does not fit the crime .
Nel said the element of mercy shown by the court in its sentencing was â€œover - exaggeratedâ€ � .
Pistorius should have received a 10-year sentence .
There was a dispute over the relevance of case law , in particular the Seekoei judgment .
The defence said Seekoei established that the state can not appeal when an accused has been convicted on a lesser charge .
Nel said it was not relevant because the state is contesting the murder acquittal , not the culpable homicide conviction .
Barry Roux , for the defence , said the appeal had no prospect of success .
He said the state had not got the result it wanted but was trying to secure an appeal based on issues of fact , not law , which is not permitted .
Roux disputed claims that Pistorius would be out of prison after 10 months : It is incorrect to say that itâ€ ™ s a light sentence â€ “ itâ€ ™ s not .
The state also wants to appeal the possession of ammunition charge , of which Pistorius was acquitted .
The defence opposes this request .
Judge Masipa said she would give her ruling on Tuesday at 9.30am ( 7.30am GMT ) .
The liveblog will be back tomorrow with live coverage of the judgeâ€ ™ s decision .
Some background reading in the meantime : The prosecutionâ€ ™ s written submission is here .
The defenceâ€ ™ s written response is here .
Thank you for reading .
Defence lawyer Barry Roux looks to be in good spirits as he leaves the court : Judge Masipa says she needs time to consider her decision .
Court adjourns to Tuesday at 9.30am South African time ( 7.30am GMT ) .
I will post a summary of todayâ€ ™ s developments shortly .
The defence appears to be wrapping up very quickly .
There is no case for appeal , Roux says .
The state wants to appeal because it did not like the verdict .
This was not what the prosecution hoped to achieve at the trial .
But he says the law does not provide for that .
Roux is finished .
Nel has nothing further .
Roux now skips to count four on the issue of possession .
There was no animus , he says .
Roux refers to the stateâ€ ™ s heads of argument â€ “ you can read them in full here .
He says the prosecution has got it wrong : it is trying to get the court to reconsider its own factual finding , â€œand you may not do that , my ladyâ€ � .
The state can not appeal , says Roux .
Is it right or wrong that it can not appeal on issues of fact ?
Thatâ€ ™ s not the point , he says : change the law if itâ€ ™ s not right , but this is where we are now .
The state is twisting things , he says , with its arguments over dolus eventualis .
( A reminder : some background on dolus eventualis here . )
Roux says it doesnâ€
™ t matter if the courtâ€ ™ s findings about Pistoriusâ€ ™ s lack of intention to kill were right or wrong ( though he thinks them right ) .
They are based on issues of fact so the state can not appeal .
They are arguing because they are unhappy with the findings , Roux says .
Itâ€ ™ s rare in a murder case for there to be direct evidence of the accusedâ€ ™ s state of mind , Roux says .
The court must draw inferences .
This is not a question of law , as the state has claimed .
Even if the court had made an error , Roux insists , it would be an error based on a point of fact , not a point of law , and so can not be grounds for appeal .
Courts have to draw inferences , Roux says .
Often these inferences are based on circumstantial evidence .
A â€œproven factâ€ � is not simply a fact that is before the court , Roux says .
It is a fact that is proven to be true by the court in its judgment .
If there is a conviction on a competent verdict â€ “ in this case , culpable homicide â€ “ there can be no appeal , says Roux .
This is clear in Seekoei .
Roux turns to the case law , including Seekoei , which Nel said were hurdles for the state in this instance :
Itâ€ ™ s not for the state to get over some hurdles .
It must first get out of the starting blocks .
Roux disputes the stateâ€ ™ s claim that Pistorius will be released from prison after 10 months .
He says the regulations state that this is the first time that release under house arrest can be considered , and even then it is discretionary .
It is incorrect to say that itâ€ ™ s a light sentence â€ “ itâ€ ™ s not .
There is no prospect of success at appeal , Roux says .
Roux says that only where there is â€œserious misdirectionâ€ � by a court can there be an appeal against sentence .
Nel has finished his submission .
Barry Roux for the defence is on his feet .
He refers to the papers already lodged with the court ; you can read those here .
The defence opposes the stateâ€ ™ s attempt to appeal against the murder acquittal and the five - year sentence for culpable homicide .
Nel says that if the judgeâ€ ™ s finding were correct , then anyone could keep any ammunition in their possession .
The court erred in saying there was no intent in this case .
Possession is sufficient .
The implications of this acquittal has wide implications for the illegal ownership of firearms and ammunition , Nel argues .
The mere possession of the ammunition in his safe means Pistorius is guilty , he says .
Nel turns to count four : the possession of ammunition charge , of which Pistorius was acquitted .
Seekoei is not relevant here because Pistorius was acquitted , he points out .
Pistorius pleaded not guilty to illegal possession of ammunition for which he didnâ€ ™ t have a licence , on the grounds that it belonged to his father .
Itâ€ ™ s common sense , Nel says , that the line of distinction between matters of fact and matters of law is â€œvery thinâ€ � .
Nel is back on his feet .
He is discussing again the difference between matters of fact ( on which the state can not appeal ) and matters of law ( on which it can ) .
The issue of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s intention when shooting is a matter of law , he says .
For those wanting to know more about the Seekoei judgment and its relevance to Pistorius , hereâ€ ™ s a handy primer : [ 11.50am GMT edit : itâ€ ™ s worth pointing out that the article linked to above was authored by Professor James Grant , who is now advising the prosecution . ]
In essence , Seekoei established that the state can appeal against a high court judgment only if there is an acquittal .
If there is a conviction on a competent verdict â€ “ in this case , Pistorius was found guilty of the lesser charge of culpable homicide â€ “
the state can not appeal it .
Nel says Seekoei is not applicable here because the state is not appealing against the culpable homicide verdict , but against the acquittal on the murder charge .
Nel asks for a break .
He concedes that his argument is a complicated one .
He still needs to deal with the appeal bid over count four ( the possession of ammunition charge , of which Pistorius was acquitted ) .
Court adjourns for 15 minutes .
We have the facts , says Nel : The accused walked , fired four shots , killed the deceased .
Itâ€ ™ s very unlikely that an accused will come to court and admit they wanted to shoot , says Nel .
The court has to make an inference from the facts , using legal tests .
Nel reads from the judgeâ€ ™ s findings that Pistorius did not subjectively foresee that his actions would kill the deceased .
The court accepted one of a plethora of versions [ of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s defence ] , which the court was not entitled to do .
The court should have considered whether he meant to shoot whoever was in the toilet cubicle , whether that was Steenkamp or the supposed intruder .
The court asked the wrong questions of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s actions , says Nel .
Why did Pistorius shoot instead of moving away from the bathroom and the supposed intruder ?
Nel : Itâ€ ™ s inconceivable that he had any intention other than to kill that person or accepted that he may .
It is an erroneous application of dolus eventualis .
Dolus eventualis doesnâ€ ™ t mean that Pistorius accepted that he would kill someone , but that he may kill someone , Nel says .
Nel is hammering this point home .
To prove murder , he says , the court does not have to believe that Pistorius wanted Steenkamp dead .
It is enough to say that he intended to shoot at the person behind the door and that he did so knowing it could have fatal consequences .
The court found that the accused had the intention to shoot , but that he never intended to kill .
What , then , was his intention , Nel asks .
Back on the four shots fired by Pistorius through the locked door : How would Pistorius not have seen that his actions would have fatal consequences , Nel asks the court .
He was trained in firearms and knew there was someone behind the door .
Even if he did not â€œwish the resultâ€ � , he must have foreseen that death was the likely outcome of his actions .
Turning to the defenceâ€ ™ s response to the appeal bid , which argues that the state is attempting to appeal on matters of fact ( which is not allowed )
, Nel insists the appeal is sought on the basis of matters of law .
It is about the application of principles to the facts , he says .
There was an erroneous application of the law , he says .
Although Nel said he would not be replaying the trial today , the themes are very similar : Pistorius should have been convicted of murder , Nel says .
If the court has wrongly applied the principle of dolus eventualis , a conviction for murder is inescapable .
Nel says he doesnâ€ ™ t have to convince this court that he is right .
He just has to convince them that there is a reasonable chance of success in the court of appeal .
Nel is rattling through various points of case law .
Nel is saying that these hurdles to the state case should not be applicable today .
Nel argues that Seekoei is not only unfair to the state , it doesnâ€ ™ t make sense .
It should not be applied here .
Nel reads in Afrikaans again and translates : because somebody has been convicted and sentenced , by the time an appeal is heard , the accused will have served part of his sentence .
Thatâ€ ™ s
par for the course , says Nel , whether itâ€ ™ s the state or defence which appeals .
The purpose of this application is the state saying there should be a harsher sentence and a conviction of murder .
Nel is reading passages in Afrikaans .
Back to English : We are not appealing the conviction of culpable homicide .
We are appealing â€ “ on a point of law â€ “ the acquittal for murder .
The gist of what has turned into a complicated monologue from Nel is that Seekoei determined that the prosecution could appeal an acquittal but not a conviction on a lesser charge ( as happened with Pistorius ) .
Nel says Seekoei is not applicable .
Nel acknowledges the assistance he has had from Professor James Grant in the case law .
Hereâ€ ™ s a little bit of information from News24.com on the Seekoei judgment : However , the state could encounter a â€œhurdleâ€ � because of the supreme court of appeal case , State vs Seekoei , which limited the stateâ€ ™ s right of appeal .
The 1982 Seekoei case held that the state could not appeal if a conviction was made on a competent verdict .
Nel says the court â€œmay have erredâ€ � in its application of the principles of dolus eventualis ( the argument Pistorius foresaw that his actions in firing four shots into the door could have led to the death of the person behind it , but went ahead anyway â€ “ which would have meant a conviction for murder ) .
The court should have taken account of the circumstantial evidence as a whole in determining whether Pistorius acted with dolus eventualis , Nel says .
The court erred , with respect , in finding that the accusedâ€ ™
s version was reasonably possibly true .
Nel returns to a favourite theme from the trial : that Pistorius had more than one version of his defence , which could not all be true and were â€œmutually destructiveâ€ � .
Nel moves on to the stateâ€ ™ s challenge against the conviction of culpable homicide .
Prosecutors want to revive the prospect of a murder conviction .
Nel says the state has â€œno problemâ€ � with the way the judge summarised the actions of Pistorius in her ruling .
But the sentence is â€œshockingly inappropriateâ€ � , he repeats .
There is a reasonable prospect of convincing another court to impose a longer sentence , he argues .
Nel says the court imposed the shortest period of incarceration it could reasonably do .
What could be less than 10 months ?
There can be instances , says Nel , when a court shows too much mercy .
That can be a misdirection .
He says in this case the element of mercy was â€œover - exaggeratedâ€ � .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s actions deserve to be punished , Nel says .
He did not fire blindly : â€œHe knew.â€ �
Nel turns to the death of Reeva Steenkamp .
An innocent woman was shot and killed in most horrendous circumstances .
The deceased must have been unbelievably fearful before she died â€ ¦
And it was caused by the gross negligence of this respondent .
The accused fired four shots .
He knew there was someone in the cubicle with no escape .
Nel returns to the issue of Pistoriusâ€ ™
s
lack of remorse .
The defence arguments against him being sent to prison at all â€ “ saying , for example , that there was a lack of shower rails in jail â€ “ shows he did not â€œcarry
throughâ€ � his claims of remorse , Nel says .
Nel says that the attitude of Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents to the sentence is irrelevant ( they said they were satisfied with the five - year term ) .
It should not be taken into account , he tells Masipa .
Thereâ€ ™ s some background on the role of the assessors during the trial here .
Nel repeats the claim in the state papers that Pistoriusâ€ ™ s actions bordered on dolus eventualis ( read a fuller explanation of that here ) .
The precedent set by this court is â€œshockingly lowâ€ � , Nel says â€ “ someone with this degree of culpability and acting with such gross negligence should have a much longer sentence .
Nel :
The sentence for what the accused did is inappropriate .
It does not fit the crime .
The court did not take into account â€ ¦ what we said is that the accused does not have remorse .
He says the fact that Pistorius might serve only 10 months in prison is inappropriate .
Masispa intervenes â€ “ release to house arrest is at the discretion of the commissioner , she points out .
Nel agrees but says 10 months would be likely , according to regulations .
Nel says his job is to convince the court that a different court might make a different finding .
He wants to start with the five - year sentence â€ “ which papers lodged by the state in advance of todayâ€ ™ s hearing called â€œshockingly lightâ€ � .
Gerrie Nel begins .
He says the bid to appeal against the verdict is not meant to show disrespect to the court , â€œand is not a decision that was lightly takenâ€ � .
He wonâ€ ™ t be arguing the case again , he adds .
The court hearing is about to start .
The Pistorius and Steenkamp families are not in court .
Gerrie Nel , for the prosecution , and Pistoriusâ€ ™ s lead defence lawyer , Barry Roux , are both in court .
James Grant is the author of this blog post , which sets out what he thinks were Judge Masipaâ€ ™ s errors in the original trial finding .
Below is the response by the defence to the stateâ€ ™ s request for leave to appeal .
It disputes the basis of the request , claiming : The state has no right of appeal â€ ¦ against incorrect factual findings by a trial court .
The state can appeal only if the trial court gave a wrong decision due to a mistake of law .
Part of the stateâ€ ™ s case is that Judge Masipa erred in her application of the principle of dolus eventualis .
The defence counters that she did â€œcorrectly
appl[y ]
the law to the factsâ€ � .
You can read below the full submission by the state setting out the basis for its request to appeal .
It makes some key allegations : â€œThe sentence of five yearsâ€ ™ imprisonment â€ ¦ for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp in the circumstances of this case is shockingly light , inappropriate and would not have been imposed by any reasonable court.â€ �
( Note that it continues to refer to Steenkampâ€ ™ s death as murder . )
Judge Thokozile Masipa â€œerred in overemphasising the personal circumstancesâ€ � of the athlete , as well as the fact that he seemed remorseful about the shooting in the immediate aftermath .
Did the court correctly apply the principles of dolus eventualis
â€ “ the notion that Pistorius foresaw that his actions in firing four shots into the door could have led to the death of the person behind it , but went ahead anyway
â€ “ in clearing him of murder ?
It reminds the judge that she herself thought Pistorius to be a very poor witness .
Under the criminal procedure act , Pistorius will qualify to be released from prison under correctional supervision after serving â€œa mere 10 monthsâ€ � .
A familiar scene at the high court in Pretoria this morning , as prosecutors , defence lawyers and Judge Thokozile Masipa reconvene to hear arguments over whether the state should be permitted to appeal the decision to find Oscar Pistorius not guilty of the murder of Reeva Steenkamp .
Pistorius was cleared of murder , but found guilty of culpable homicide ( manslaughter ) after Judge Masipa ruled that he acted negligently when he shot Steenkamp , his girlfriend , four times through a closed toilet door but that he had not intended to kill her .
The prosecution wants the judge to grant it permission to appeal this verdict , and the five - year sentence subsequently handed down .
If Masipa does agree to grant the appeal , the case will be move to South Africaâ€ ™ s supreme court of appeal in Bloemfontein .
If she does not , the state can decide to petition that decision .
One person who is unlikely to make an appearance today is Pistorius himself .
He is currently serving his sentence in the hospital wing of Kgosi Mampuru prison and is not expected to come to court .
Today , we will hear submissions from the prosecution and the defence .
Masipa is then expected to give her decision â€ “ although delays have not been uncommon in this trial to date .
There will be live coverage throughout the day on this blog .

2014-12-09,"The mercy shown Oscar Pistorius was “ over - exaggerated ” when he was jailed for five years for shooting dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp , a court heard on Tuesday .
The sentence was “ shockingly inappropriate ” and should be sent to South Africa ’s supreme court of appeal for review , prosecutor Gerrie Nel told judge Thokozile Masipa at a hearing in Pretoria .
Nel applied for an appeal after Masipa found Pistorius guilty of culpable homicide , the South African equivalent of manslaughter , instead of murder and imposed the punishment that could see him qualify for house arrest after just 10 months .
Masipa will on rule on Wednesday whether the prosecution ’s appeal can go ahead .
The Paralympian admits shooting Steenkamp , a model and law graduate , four times through a locked toilet door at his home on Valentine ’s Day last year but claims he mistook her for a burglar .
He is serving his sentence in the capital ’s Kgosi Mampuru II prison and was not in court on Tuesday .
Nel argued before Masipa : “
An innocent woman was shot and killed in most horrendous circumstances .
The deceased must have been unbelievably fearful before she died ...
And it was caused by the gross negligence of this respondent .
“
The accused fired four shots .
He knew there was someone in the cubicle with no escape … He did n’t fire blindly
– he knew where the person was .
This was a person trained in the use of firearms .
”
Nel said he was aware of mercy as a factor in criminal justice but contended :
“
There can also be an instance where too much mercy is shown to an accused .
Based on all the facts , we say that the element of mercy was over - exaggerated .
”
The court had imposed the shortest possible sentence it could reasonably impose , he continued , which set a dangerously low precedent for future cases of negligence .
“
The sentence for what the accused did is inappropriate .
It does not fit the crime …
There is a very good prospect that we may convince an appeal court that the shortest possible incarceration in a case like this , my lady , is shockingly inappropriate .
”
The prosecutor also challenged Pistorius ’s conviction for culpable homicide , saying the court had erred in its application of dolus eventualis , a category of murder where the perpetrator subjectively foresees the possibility of his act causing death and persists regardless .
The athlete should have known that firing four shots through the door would result in death , even if he did not “ wish the result ” , Nel claimed .
“
It ’s inconceivable that he had any intention other than to kill that person or accepted that he may .
It is an erroneous application of dolus eventualis .
”
The state was pushing , he summed up , for “ a harsher sentence and a harsher conviction
” – a conviction of murder .
But defence counsel Barry Roux replied that the appeal had no prospect of success .
He said the state had not got the result it wanted but was trying to secure an appeal based on issues of fact , not law , which is not allowed .
“
It ’s not for the state to get over some hurdles , ” he suggested .
“ It must first get out of the starting blocks .
”
The court had found that Pistorius had no intention to kill , Roux explained .
“ If the finding is he did not intend to kill , can it ever be dolus eventualis ?
”
He told the judge : “ Their problem is they do n’t like your factual finding .
They do n’t appreciate that .
You absolutely , correctly applied the law .
”
Roux disputed the suggestion that Pistorius would be out of prison after 10 months .
“
It is incorrect to say that it ’s a light sentence .
It ’s not .
What we ’re actually dealing with is an academic debate .
”
The state also wants to appeal against a possession of ammunition charge of which Pistorius , a double amputee known as the “ Blade Runner ” , was acquitted .
The defence opposes this request .
Masipa said she would give her ruling at 9.30am local time on Wednesday .
Should she grant the appeal , the case will be heard in South Africa ’s supreme court of appeal in Bloemfontein , the country ’s judicial capital .
If she refuses , the state can still petition the supreme court to hear the case .
The so - called “ trial of the century ” was shown live on television and gripped millions around the world .
On Tuesday the high court in Pretoria appeared much quieter , with the white tents erected by international broadcasters over the road long packed away , and a smaller contingent of journalists in the courtroom .
The front row of the public gallery , for so long occupied by the Pistorius and Steenkamp families , was empty .
Pistorius reportedly spends 17 hours a day in a 6 ft by 8 ft cell and marked his 28th birthday in jail last month .
His older brother , Carl , told South Africa
’s
You magazine :
“
He ’s encountering many beautiful stories from prisoners .
There are people there who have committed crimes but whose lives have changed .
”
Carl said his brother has been allocated a stool to sit on in a communal shower room rather than having his own private bathroom .
Pistorius relies on weekly 45-minute visits with his family to leave cash at the canteen
so he can supplement his standard prison diet with snacks including baked beans and canned pilchards .
“
He now lives moment by moment , ” Carl added .
“
There ’s no fairytale . ”"
2014-12-10,"Oscar Pistorius could yet be convicted of murder and face at least 15 years in prison after a judge granted prosecutors the right to appeal against her verdict that he was guilty of the lesser charge of culpable homicide .
Judge Thokozile Masipa said she was satisfied that prosecutor Gerrie Nel had raised â€œquestions of lawâ€ � that another court could interpret differently when considering the Paralympianâ€ ™ s intentions in shooting dead his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp .
â€œI can not say â€ ¦ that the prospect of success at the supreme court of appeal is remote , â€ �
Masipa ruled at the high court in Pretoria , South Africa .
â€œThe application therefore in respect of count one is decided in favour of the applicant.â€ �
The decision is likely to be welcomed by Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents , Barry and June , who strongly condemned the original verdict , as well as campaigners against domestic violence who believe it sent a dangerous message to society .
The Steenkampsâ€ ™ lawyer , Dup de Bruyn , said : â€œAll theyâ€ ™ re saying is justice must run its course and they want to get on with their lives.â€
�
The matter will now go to the supreme court of appeal in Bloemfontein , the countryâ€ ™ s judicial capital , but typically it can take at least a year for a case to be heard .
By then Pistorius may already be out of prison and under house arrest because of the terms of his five - year sentence .
A panel of judges at the supreme court will consider whether Masipa erred in not applying the principle of dolus eventualis , a category of murder where the perpetrator subjectively foresees the possibility of his or her act causing death and persists regardless .
If it decides Pistoriusâ€ ™ s actions fall within this definition , it can upgrade his culpable homicide conviction to murder , which carries a minimum 15-year sentence .
The double amputee athlete admits shooting Steenkamp , a model and law graduate , four times through a locked toilet door at his home on Valentineâ€ ™ s Day last year but claims he mistook her for an intruder .
Pistorius , 28 , is serving his sentence in Kgosi Mampuru II prison in the capital and was not in court on Wednesday .
His father , Henke , was the only member of either Pistorius or Steenkampâ€ ™ s families in the public gallery .
After Masipaâ€ ™ s ruling , he said : â€œI donâ€ ™ t want to say anything before itâ€ ™ s decided but it shouldnâ€ ™ t have gone this far.â€ �
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s uncle , Arnold Pistorius , currently abroad , said in a statement : â€œWe note the finding of the court and abide by the ruling.â€ �
South Africaâ€ ™ s beleaguered National Prosecuting Authority ( NPA ) , under fire after the collapse of the Shrien Dewani murder trial this week , welcomed the judgeâ€ ™ s decision .
Its spokesman , Nathi Mncube said : â€œThis is what we wanted and we are happy the judge would deliver judgment in our favour .
â€œOur argument was that he should have been convicted of murder , and then would have been sentenced to a minimum sentence of 15 years .
That is , of course , what we would like to happen .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not about winning .
Itâ€ ™ s about justice and justice has been served , and I think thatâ€ ™ s what people want â€ ¦
The judges do not just rubber - stamp decisions.â€ �
Mncube said he hoped the appeal would be â€œexpeditedâ€ � but acknowledged that the process could take a long time .
â€œThe person who is accused , Iâ€ ™ m sure , would like to know as soon as possible.â€ �
Masipa dismissed separate state applications for leave to appeal against Pistoriusâ€ ™ s five - year sentence and his acquittal on a charge of illegal possession of ammunition .
Ncube said the NPA would consider whether to petition the supreme court of appeal directly on these counts .
On Tuesday Nel had argued that the sentence was â€œshockingly inappropriateâ€ � .
â€œBased on all the facts , we say that the element of mercy was over - exaggerated , â€ � he said .
Disputing the conviction , he claimed that Pistorius should have known that firing four shots through the door would result in death , even if he did not â€œwish the resultâ€ � .
He said :

It is an erroneous application of dolus eventualis.â€ �"
2014-12-10,"Judge Thokozile Masipa has allowed a request by prosecutors to appeal against the acquittal of Oscar Pistorius on the charge of murder : I can not say ... that the prospect of success at the Supreme Court of Appeal is remote â€
¦
I am also of the view ... this might have a practical effect .
The application therefore in respect of count one is decided in favour of the applicant [ the state ] .
But the judge refused to allow the state to challenge the five - year sentence imposed for the culpable homicide of Reeva Steenkamp : I am not persuaded that there was any material misdirection or irregularity , or that on the facts of this matter the sentence imposed was shockingly inappropriate .
South Africaâ€ ™ s supreme court of appeal in Bloemfontain will now hear
the stateâ€ ™ s case that Masipa â€ “ the original trial judge â€ “ erred in her application of the principles of dolus eventualis in clearing Pistorius of intentionally shooting dead his girlfriend in his home in Pretoria February 2013 .
The appeal could take place as early as February , but is likely to be later in 2015 , raising the possibility that Pistorius could be out of prison under house arrest by the time the appeal is heard .

The judge refused to allow the state leave to appeal against Pistoriusâ€ ™ acquittal on the charge of illegal possession of ammunition .

Thank you for reading .
Dup de Bruyn , the lawyer for June and Barry Steenkamp , parents of Reeva Steenkamp , has issued a very brief statement on todayâ€ ™ s decision : All theyâ€ ™ re saying is justice must run its course and they want to get on with their lives .
My colleague David Smith , who was in court in Pretoria today , files this report : Oscar Pistorius could yet be convicted of murder and face at least 15 years in prison after a judge granted prosecutors the right to appeal against her verdict that he was guilty of the lesser charge of culpable homicide .
Judge Thokozile Masipa said she was satisfied that prosecutor Gerrie Nel had raised questions of law that a different court could interpret differently when considering the Paralympianâ€ ™ s intentions in shooting dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp .

Nathi Mncube , spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority ( NPA ) , has just been speaking to Sky News : We got most of what we wanted .
The main thing was to get the court to agree to the leave to appeal in respect of the murder charge .
Of course there were the other two issues on which the court did not agree with us today â€ ¦ the court felt there was no prospect of successful appeal in respect of sentence â€
¦
The process from now on is that we wait for the supreme court of appeal , who will give us a date for the prosecuting authority and the defence to submit our [ written ] heads of argument .
We will then be given another date to come and argue the matter .
The SCA will then deliver its judgment .
We all depend on the SCA for the dates .
They decide the dates â€ “ it is not up to the NPA , it is not up to the defence â€

It could very well be as early as February next year .
Apart from Henke Pistorius , the two days of the appeal hearing have not seen the family members â€ “ of either Oscar Pistorius or Reeva Steenkamp â€ “ in court .
But the athleteâ€ ™ s family has now issued a very short statement : There has not yet been a response from Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents to the news that prosecutors will be able to renew their attempts to secure a murder conviction .
Henke Pistorius , the athleteâ€ ™ s estranged father , was in court today .
He told reporters that his son â€œwas taught that life can sometimes be unfairâ€ � but said he had faith in the justice system .
Oscar Pistorius was not in court
â€

he is currently serving his sentence in the hospital wing of Kgosi Mampuru prison .
Prosecutors have welcomed the decision to allow them to challenge the murder charge acquittal .
Nathi Ncube of the National Prosecuting Authority told reporters : Weâ€ ™ re happy .
Our argument was that he should have been convicted of murder , and then would have been sentenced to a minimum sentence of 15 years .
That is , of course , what we would like to happen .
It isnâ€ ™ t about winning â€ “ itâ€ ™ s about justice .
The supreme court of appeal ( SCA ) sits at Bloemfontain ; from its website , here is some more information about the form the Pistorius appeal could take : The court decides cases upon the record of the proceedings before the lower court and after considering the written and oral arguments presented .
Witnesses do not appear before the court , and the parties need not be present during the hearing of an appeal .
A written judgment is usually handed down shortly after the argument .
The court hears appeals on fact and since there are no jury trials , it has a relatively wide discretion to make its own factual findings .
Because of this jurisdiction , judges have to read the record of the full proceedings in the lower courts â€ ¦
The court sits in panels of five or three judges , depending on the nature of the appeal .
The composition of the panels differs for each case .
The senior judge on each panel presides in that case .
There may be more than one judgment in a case if there is a difference of opinion .
The decision of the majority is the decision of the court .
The dates on which the SCA sits are also fairly limited â€ “ the next session does not start until 15 February 2015 .
Judge Thokozile Masipa told the court she would allow the stateâ€ ™ s request to appeal against Pistoriusâ€ ™ acquittal on count one â€ “ murder â€ “ on the grounds that there were issues of law , particularly surrounding the application of dolus eventualis , that needed to be clarified : I can not say ... that the prospect of success at the Supreme Court of Appeal is remote â€
¦
I am also of the view ... this might have a practical effect .
The application therefore in respect of count one is decided in favour of the applicant [ the state ] .
The application for leave to appeal against the sentence is dismissed .
Hereâ€ ™ s a quick round - up from reporters on the scene in Pretoria :
South Africaâ€ ™ s National Prosecuting Authority ( NPA ) says it will take time to decide whether to petition the judge over her decision that it can not challenge the five - year sentence for culpable homicide .
NPA spokesman Nathi Mncube says this case isnâ€ ™ t about winning â€ “ itâ€ ™ s about justice .
Hereâ€ ™ s the response from James Grant , the law professor who advised the state on its request to appeal : The defence said that the so - called Seekoei judgment established that the state can not appeal when an accused has been convicted on a lesser charge ( Pistorius wasd charged with murder , but convicted of culpable homicide ) .
Nel said it was not relevant because the state is contesting the murder acquittal , not the culpable homicide conviction .
Thereâ€ ™ s some background on Seekoei here .
This is a success for the prosecution â€ “ led by Gerrie Nel â€ “ which can now proceed with its appeal against the verdict that Pistorius did not murder Reeva Steenkamp .
It lost its application to challenge the five - year sentence for culpable homicide , although it could petition that decision .
The state was also ordered to pay defence costs .
Although the judge did not give the state leave to appeal against the five - year sentence for culpable homicide , my understanding is that if the supreme court of appeal did decide to overturn the acquittal on the murder charge â€ “ and if Pistorius were , after all , to be found guilty of murder â€ “ a different sentence could be applied at that point .
The case will now move to South Africaâ€ ™ s supreme court of appeal in Bloemfontein .
The key point of dispute is the judgeâ€ ™ s interpretation of dolus eventualis and the application of its principles to the circumstances of this case .
The judgeâ€ ™ s decision to rule out murder by dolus eventualis â€ “
that is , that Pistorius subjectively foresaw that his actions in firing four shots into the door could have led to the death of the person behind it , but went ahead anyway
â€ “ has attracted questions and criticism .
That should be cleared up in the supreme court .
That was a very short hearing but with some big news .
The judge has given the state leave to appeal against Pistoriusâ€ ™ s acquittal on the charge of murder .
But the state was not given permission to appeal against the five - year sentence imposed , nor against the acquittal on the charge of possessing illegal ammunition .
The state was ordered to pay costs .
Masipa says that in respect of count four â€ “ the acquittal on the charge of possessing illegal ammunition
â€
“
she does not give the state leave to appeal .
Masipa says this matter â€œis not an easy oneâ€ � .
I have been persuaded that the questions are questions of law .
That being so
, I can not say â€ ¦ that the prospect of success at the supreme court of appeal is remote .
She allows the appeal on the murder acquittal .
Masipa now moves on to the stateâ€ ™ s request to appeal the acquittal on the charge of murder .
The issue is whether the request is based on questions of law ( the only permitted means of appeal ) or â€œquestions of fact masquerading as questions of lawâ€ � .
Would a different court come to a different finding on the sentence , Masipa asks ( this is Nelâ€ ™ s case ) .
In none of the submissions for the state did they show any misdirection that would vitiate the sentence , she says .
I am not persuaded that there was any material misdirection or irregularity , or that on the facts of this matter the sentence imposed was shockingly inappropriate .
She says this point â€œcannot
succeedâ€ � .
She dismisses leave to appeal the sentence .
The parents of Reeva Steenkamp expressed a satisfaction with the sentence .
Gerrie Nel , for the state , yesterday said it was irrelevant .
Masipa agrees that defence can not rely on the views of the Steenkamps in its opposition to the request to appeal .
This application will be treated only on its own merits , not on the basis that the case attracted public interest , Masipa says .
Everyone is equal before the law .
Masipa says she must deal with two issues raised by the the papers filed by state and defence .
( You can read them below here and here . )
She says it is important to clear up any misunderstandings about how the courts work .
Judge Masipa begins right away reading her ruling .
Pistorius and his father are estranged .
It was Henke Pistoriusâ€ ™ s ammunition that Pistorius claimed he was holding for safekeeping for the possession of ammunition charge of which Pistorius was acquitted .
The state is also seeking leave to appeal that acquittal .
The legal teams have arrived at the high court in Pretoria .
Pistorius himself will not attend .
He is currently serving his sentence in the hospital wing of Kgosi Mampuru prison .
It doesnâ€ ™ t appear that Barry Roux , lead counsel for the defence , is here , but we are not expecting legal arguments today , just the judgeâ€ ™ s ruling .
Yesterday also saw a dispute over the relevance of case law , in particular the Seekoei judgment , which is likely to rear its head again in the judgeâ€ ™ s ruling .
The defence said Seekoei established that the state can not appeal when an accused has been convicted on a lesser charge .
Nel said it was not relevant because the state is contesting the murder acquittal , not the culpable homicide conviction .
There is some useful background on Seekoei here , in an article written by law professor James Grant , who is now advising the prosecution .
Below is the response by the defence to the stateâ€ ™ s request for leave to appeal .
It disputes the basis of the request , claiming : The state has no right of appeal â€ ¦ against incorrect factual findings by a trial court .
The state can appeal only if the trial court gave a wrong decision due to a mistake of law .
Part of the stateâ€ ™ s case is that Judge Masipa erred in her application of the principle of dolus eventualis .
The defence counters that she did â€œcorrectly
appl[y ]
the law to the factsâ€ � .
With apologies to readers of yesterdayâ€ ™ s blog who will have already seen this , you can read below the full submission by the state setting out the basis for its request to appeal .
It makes some key allegations : â€œThe sentence of five yearsâ€ ™ imprisonment â€ ¦ for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp in the circumstances of this case is shockingly light , inappropriate and would not have been imposed by any reasonable court.â€ �
( Note that it continues to refer to Steenkampâ€ ™ s death as murder . )
Judge Thokozile Masipa â€œerred in overemphasising the personal circumstancesâ€ � of the athlete , as well as the fact that he seemed remorseful about the shooting in the immediate aftermath .
Did the court correctly apply the principles of dolus eventualis
â€ “ the notion that Pistorius foresaw that his actions in firing four shots into the door could have led to the death of the person behind it , but went ahead anyway
â€ “ in clearing him of murder ?
It reminds the judge that she herself thought Pistorius to be a very poor witness .
Under the criminal procedure act , Pistorius will qualify to be released from prison under correctional supervision after serving â€œa mere 10 monthsâ€ � .
The high court in Pretoria reconvenes at 9.30am
( 7.30am GMT ) to hear Judge Thokozile Masipa rule whether prosecutors can take their challenge to Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ s conviction and sentence to the supreme court of appeal .
Yesterday the court heard arguments from state prosecutor Gerrie Nel that Masipa â€ “ the judge who acquitted Pistorius of murder and sentenced him to five years for the culpable homicide of Reeva Steenkamp â€
“ must allow an appeal against her findings .
The defence opposes the request and says the appeal has no prospect of success .
Hereâ€ ™ s a brief summary of yesterdayâ€ ™ s developments : Nel said the court had erred in its application of the principles of dolus eventualis , because the accused should have known that firing four shots through a toilet cubicle door would result in death , even if he did not â€œwish the resultâ€ � .
Pistorius should have been found guilty of murder .
Itâ€ ™ s inconceivable that he had any intention other than to kill that person or accepted that he may .
It is an erroneous application of dolus eventualis .
Nel said the five - year sentence imposed was â€œshockingly inappropriateâ€ � and a different court would be likely to impose a harsher punishment .
The prosecutor said the element of mercy shown by the court in its sentencing was â€œover - exaggeratedâ€ � .
Pistorius should have received a 10-year sentence .
Barry Roux , for the defence , said the state had not got the result it wanted and was trying to secure an appeal based on issues of fact , not law , which is not permitted .
Judge Masipa will also announce today whether the state can lodge an appeal on the possession of ammunition charge of which Pistorius was acquitted .
The defence opposes this request .

2014-12-31,"Every now and then during his blockbuster murder trial , Oscar Pistorius could be seen deep in conversation with a pony - tailed , 43-year - old courtroom sketch artist called Jaco van Vuuren .
Was the disgraced athlete discussing his defence strategy , his deepest fears , his possible fate ?
“
Me and him being bachelors , I tried to talk about women , if there ’s any hot media girls , that type of thing , ” Van Vuuren recalls , laughing .
“
Also his knowledge about athletics was still brilliant .
He knew about times run yesterday in a competition in America and everything of that sort .
So we spoke mainly about athletics .
” Sitting at a fish restaurant in one of Pretoria ’s roadside strip malls , he can now draw breath and reflect on the televised courtroom epic that dominated 2014 on his sketch pad and on screens around the world .
He played a double role , as an athletics coach who has known Pistorius since he was 16 and as the only court artist charged with capturing his tearful , visceral dismantling .
The Paralympian , dubbed the “ Blade Runner ” because of his prosthetic limbs , was found guilty of culpable homicide for shooting dead his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , and jailed for five years .
Van Vuuren , who hopes to sketch him in prison , relays a story he heard from a warden :
“
The biggest problem now for Oscar is the top brass at correctional services coming into his cell day and night and taking selfies with him .
There ’s no control and the lower ranks ca n’t chase them out , so Oscar is annoyed .
”
Van Vuuren is a former international pole vaulter with a respectable personal best of 5.20 metres .
Since 1992 he has been coaching pole vaulters at the University of Pretoria , where his path first crossed with Pistorius .
He has been a court artist for four years , covering some of South Africa ’s biggest trials , including former police commissioner Jackie Selebi ’s corruption conviction .
“
I ended up as a sketch artist in court because of an absolute obsession , ” said the art teacher ’s son .
“
There was no money .
I just had to do it .
There was no other way .
”
The essentials of a face typically take him two or three minutes , and the full sketch anything from 20 to 45 .
“
It ’s always an eerie feeling before the judge does a life sentence .
”
There have been divorce cases , too :
“
The body language , they just hate each other , there ’s so much emotion going there .
”
In early February 2013 , Van Vuuren had a drink with Pistorius to discuss helping the sprinter ’s charity projects for amputees in Africa .
On the morning of Valentine ’s Day , he was woken by a phone call .
“ I was in bed , very early , at about a quarter past six and a reporter from [ the newspaper ]
Beeld called me and said , ‘ Did you hear what your friend did?’ Being sarcastic
I said , what friend where ?
He said , ‘ No , Oscar ’s shot his girlfriend’ .
“
On the track that day it was obviously a feeling of disbelief .
It was indescribable .
He trains there every day and he shot his girlfriend .
It ’s somebody that we are obviously very proud of because it ’s Oscar Pistorius
, he ’s the biggest name next to Nelson Mandela in South Africa .
That ’s on the level that he was seen , and all of a sudden this .
”
The nation remains numb with shock , Van Vuuren believes .
“
I still think that South Africans ca n’t cope that well with the idea .
It will still take time , even longer than this , because you ca n’t admire and support a guy in the Olympics the one day , and the next day he ’s in an orange jumpsuit .
I do n’t think people are there yet .
I actually heard of a psychologist that wanted to open centres for therapy for people –
I think that ’s a little bit too far , but that ’s how bad it was .
”
From the start , Pistorius maintained that he had mistaken Steenkamp for an intruder when he armed himself , walked down a darkened corridor and fired four lethally expanding bullets through a locked toilet door .
The 29-year - old model and law graduate had no means of escape and died almost instantly .
Van Vuuren believes the Olympic runner ’s version of events , but adds a new , intriguing twist .
“
The one thing ’s that not mentioned in court , and we still do n’t know why it ’s not been brought up : he was as nervous as hell a week before that happened .
He was on the track and I heard this from another Olympian who trained with him .
He was as nervous as hell as if something was bound to happen .
”
Over eight months , the “ mega - trial ” gripped the public like the murder cases of Victorian England , only now there were the modern trappings of TV cameras , Twitter and book deals .
Proceedings veered from opera to soap opera , with a cast that included a black female judge , expert witnesses of sometimes questionable competence , and a social milieu of Pistorius ’s neighbours , pals and former girlfriend .
The celebrity in the dock repeatedly broke down , wailing and weeping like a child .
Van Vuuren , in court to draw it all for broadcasters including CNN , found the spectacle difficult to watch .
“
You ’re first of all a track friend
but you ’re also a courtroom artist
and there ’s always the discretion you have to use .
It was a draining process from start to finish .
“
Knowing him very well it was hard emotions
and I must honestly admit , from time to time you want to bloody headbutt him ,
and then a second on you want to hug him and say you got it wrong ,
let ’s work through this .
“
A lot of times you had to cut off your emotions and say you ’re here for a reason .
”
On one occasion he had to pass the sick bag .
“
It was tough when they went through the visuals and Oscar started puking , ” he recalled .
“
I was sitting next to him , about two metres away , and then he started puking and what I did was clean out my bag because I knew he was dry heaving .
I threw the plastic bag to him ; all my Koki pens were thrown out .
It was the only bag I could use because I could n’t get the attention of the court orderlies .
I threw the plastic bag over the barrier into the dock , so he used that .
”
Asked if he tried to sketch Pistorius in the act of vomiting , Van Vuuren replied : “ Never .
I said this is where I draw the line .
Use your discretion and integrity .
” Prosecutor Gerrie Nel , dubbed the pitbull , mauled Pistorius and other witnesses during cross - examination and , like a dog with a bone , will appeal against the culpable homicide conviction at the supreme court next year .
But Van Vuuren says there is another side to him .
“
I bumped accidentally into Gerrie Nel a couple of days ago in Exclusive Books [ a retail chain ] .
He ’s quite upbeat about the case , although he actually feels sorry for Oscar .
Even Gerrie Nel said it ca n’t be easy for the guy in jail .
So he ’s got a heart , but this is the law .
”
Van Vuuren said Pistorius ’s aunt called him recently because the 28-year - old wants to start sketching in his prison cell and is seeking tips .
“
He takes it day by day .
We have to know , whoever he is , whatever he did , he is probably a bigger survivor than all of us together , looking at what he went through in his life .
“
I ’ll tell you one thing , Oscar will give anything in his power to change that day , go back and not do it .
One day in jail is 10 years too many .
South African jail is a hellhole of note .
I once went to visit a prison
and you do n’t want to go there .
Lying around there from where he was , my heart goes out to him .
”
Van Vuuren , who recently turned 44 , may never draw a trial on such a scale again .
But he has discovered his vocation .
He said : “ Court is the best place in the whole world for me to be .
I see myself as very fortunate to be on that spot where it ’s always a make or break for this person .
It may be a sombre mood , but the intense emotion in that stillness –
I feed from that emotion .
”"
2015-02-20,"Paddy Powerâ€ ™ s Oscar Pistorius ad has been named the most complained - about UK campaign of last year .
Advertising watchdog the ASA received a record 5,525 complaints about Paddy Powerâ€ ™ s campaign , which offered â€œmoney back if he walksâ€ � for punters betting on the outcome of the murder trial .
It took the unusual step of ordering the campaign to be pulled immediately , saying it was it was likely to cause widespread offence .
Paddy Power is no stranger to controversy in its advertising campaigns .
In 2010 , it launched an ad showing a cat being kicked into a tree by a blind footballer .
Despite being the most complained - about ad of the year , it was cleared by the ASA and did not face a ban .
In second place was an advert for Booking.com , which caused offence by using the word â€œbookingâ€ � as an apparent substitute for a swearword .
Despite the fact it attracted 1,768 complaints in 2014 and almost 600 this year , the ASA decided this week not to ban it , ruling that it was â€œunlikely to condone or encourage swearing amongst childrenâ€ � .
Third was the Sunâ€ ™ s â€œWin a Date with a Page 3 Modelâ€ � ad with 1,711 complaints .
It was banned by the ASA for being â€œsexistâ€ � and â€œdemeaningâ€ � .
The ASA said that social media helped drive record numbers of complaints for all the top three most complained - about ads .
Both the Paddy Power campaign and the Sun advert faced opposition on Twitter and through petitions on sites such as Change.org .
The ASA chief executive , Guy Parker , said : â€œ2014 was the year social media came into its own in making it easier than ever to lodge complaints en masse .
While some ads will inevitably split opinion , as the diverse nature of complaints we received shows , last year underlined the importance of our work in cracking down on misleading ads , including copycat websites , that are simply unfair to consumers.â€ � Sainsburyâ€ ™ s
Christmas ad also proved controversial , with 823 people objecting to its depiction of the 1914 Christmas Day truce during the first world war .
The ASA acknowledged that some people might find the ad in poor taste , but decided not to ban it .
Also in the top 10 most complained - about ads were campaigns by Save the Children , Waitrose , VIP Electronic Cigarettes , Flora Buttery and two passport renewal services , uk-passport.net and passport-uk.co.uk ."
2015-02-24,"Lawyers for Oscar Pistorius will return to court next month to challenge prosecutorsâ€ ™ arguments that he should be convicted of murder and sentenced to a minimum of 15 years in jail .
The disgraced Paralympian is currently serving a five - year jail sentence for shooting dead his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , but could be moved to house arrest in August .
Judge Thokozile Masipa ruled in December that state prosecutors could go to the supreme court of appeal over her verdict of culpable homicide â€
“ the South African equivalent of manslaughter â€ “ and seek to have it upgraded to murder .
An appeal can only be granted on a question of law , not on a judgeâ€ ™ s factual findings .
Masipa agreed with the prosecutorsâ€ ™ contention that the verdict was based on her interpretation of law , but the defence will seek to cast doubt on this at the South Gauteng high court in Johannesburg on 13 March .
â€œWe will argue that these are matters of fact , rather than matters of law ,
â€ �
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s lawyer Brian Webber said on Tuesday .
By lodging the application now , Pistoriusâ€ ™ s defence team hope that Masipa will concede that another court could find the verdict was based on fact rather than law .
This may prove a crucial legal weapon for them and deprive the state of momentum when the case is heard at the supreme court later this year .
Pistorius , a double amputee known as the Blade Runner , killed Steenkamp by shooting four times through a locked toilet door at his luxury home in Pretoria two years ago .
He told the court that he mistook her for a burglar , while prosecutors argued that he shot her after an argument .
A panel of judges at the supreme court will consider whether Masipa erred in not applying the principle of dolus eventualis , a category of murder where the perpetrator subjectively foresees the possibility of his or her act causing death and persists regardless .
If it decides Pistoriusâ€ ™ s actions fall within this definition , it can upgrade his culpable homicide conviction to murder , which carries a minimum sentence of 15 years .
Steenkampâ€ ™ s mother , June , said on Tuesday that she had moved on and was no longer following the case .
â€œIâ€
™ m not focusing my life any more on Oscar , â€ � she told the Guardian .
â€œIf by law
they condemn him to a longer sentence ,
thatâ€ ™ s got nothing to do with me .
What happens to Oscar now happens to Oscar .
It isnâ€ ™ t going to affect me .
Reeva is never going to walk through that door again.â€ �
She added : â€œIâ€ ™ m not a vengeful person and I donâ€ ™ t wish ill on anyone .
The appeal is up to the law .
The law must take its course and God must take His course.â€ �
It was reported earlier this month that Pistorius has been given new privileges in the maximum - security Kgosi Mampuru II prison , including the right to wear jewellery , own a radio and have physical contact with visitors ."
2015-03-13,"Judge Thokozile Masipa has struck out an application by lawyers for Oscar Pistorius that they should be given leave to appeal against her decision to allow the state to challenge the acquittal of Pistorius on a charge of murder .
Prosecutors say the athleteâ€ ™ s conviction for culpable homicide ( manslaughter ) of Reeva Steenkamp ought to have been one of murder and will take their appeal to the supreme court in Bloemfontein later this year .
Barry Roux , for Pistorius , had argued that the culpable homicide verdict was reached on matters of fact , which can not be the basis for an appeal .
Masipa had previously given the state leave to appeal after she agreed that a different court might reach a different verdict on a point of law â€ “ namely the interpretation of the principle of dolus eventualis .
Roux argued today that it was his legal obligation to raise this argument to ensure he would be able to make these points at the supreme court at a later date .
But Gerrie Nel , for the prosecution , said the defence application should be struck off the roll , saying there was no provision in law for the court to hear the application .
Nel said there was no reason why the defence could not raise its arguments in the supreme court .
The National Prosecuting Authority must by late May file a transcript of the original trial to the supreme court , after which each side will submit written arguments , and a date for a hearing can be set .
It is therefore possible â€ “ given that Pistorius could leave prison under house arrest after serving 10 months of his sentence ; that is , in August this year â€ “ that he could be out of jail by the time any appeal hearing takes place .
This live blog is closing now .
Thank you for reading .
You can read our story on this morningâ€ ™ s developments here .
It looks as if the supreme court at Bloemfontein will not be hearing the Pistorius appeal any time soon : â€œHeadsâ€ � refers to the written heads of arguments that need to be submitted to the court by both prosecution and defence teams .
It is therefore possible â€ “ given that legally Pistorius could be allowed to leave prison under house arrest after serving 10 months of his sentence ; that is , in August this year â€ “ that he could be out of jail by the time any appeal hearing takes place .
Velekhaya Mgobhozi , a spokesperson for
South Africaâ€ ™ s National Prosecuting Authority ( NPA ) , is now speaking to eNCA news : The NPA is very happy with the decision reached by the court today .
By â€œlate Mayâ€ � the NPA will file the transcript of the original trial to the supreme court , after which a date can be set for an appeal hearing , he said .
Asked why the NPA was pursuing the appeal against Pistoriusâ€ ™ acquittal on the charge of murdering Reeva Steenkamp , Mgobhozi said : We feel in our hearts , respectfully , that the judge erred in her judgment and that a different court would reach a different verdict .
Marius du Toit , an attorney , is being interviewed on the eNCA news channel about the case .
He doesnâ€ ™ t believe the defence will be too concerned about todayâ€ ™ s outcome .
I donâ€
™ t believe this was an exercise in futility â€ ¦
[ It was ] making sure that
by the time it gets to the SCA he can now say , I did appeal it and it was dismissed .
The supreme court of appeal ( SCA ) can not now refuse to hear arguments on the grounds that the defence didnâ€ ™ t attempt to appeal against the state application .
Today was all about Barry Roux â€œdotting his iâ€ ™ s and crossing his tâ€ ™ sâ€ � , he says .
It is now likely that the SCA will have to decide before anything else is heard whether Masipa was right to allow the state leave to appeal at all .
In the end , then , Judge Masipa dispatched the defence application very speedily .
Her court was not the right place to hear this application , she said , adding that there was â€œreally nothing newâ€ � in what the defence had submitted .
You can read a summary of the defence case â€ “ and the stateâ€ ™ s successful response â€ “ here .
The next round in this trial now moves to the supreme court of appeal in Bloemfontein .
A date has not yet been set for this hearing .
There is really nothing new in the submissions by counsel for the applicant [ Pistorius ] .
She strikes out the application by the defence .
Masipa :
I am not satisfied that this is the correct court to hear this application .
As we know , Masipa likes to explain her reasoning behind all decisions .
So she begins by setting out what weâ€ ™ ve heard so far this morning (
hereâ€ ™ s a brief summary by me ) .
Judge Masipa has returned to the court room .
The defence case Barry Roux , for Pistorius , insisted this was not an application for leave to appeal against the stateâ€ ™ s leave to appeal .
It was his legal obligation , he said , to raise this argument now â€ “ ahead of the full appeal hearing in the supreme court â€ “ to ensure he would be able to make the points at that later date .
He asked Judge Masipa to agree that her earlier ruling â€ “ giving the state leave to appeal based on an agreement that a different court could reach a different verdict on the murder charge based on interpretation of the law â€ “ could have been wrong .
Roux argues that the culpable homicide verdict was reached on matters of fact , which can not be the basis for an appeal .
The stateâ€ ™ s case Gerrie Nel , for the prosecution , said the defence application should be struck off the roll .
He said there was no provision in law for the court to even hear an application of this kind , let alone to grant it .
And , he said , there was no reason why the defence could not raise its arguments in the supreme court .
Judge Masipa is still in her chambers , considering her decision .
Given the speediness of the hearing , itâ€ ™ s expected that she will come back with a ruling today , but as the lengthy main trial showed , things can sometimes take a lot longer than expected .
Outside the court , there has been some controversy ahead of this hearing concerning the â€œprivilegesâ€ � apparently afforded to Pistorius inside Kgosi Mampuru II prison , where he is serving his sentence .
Reports have claimed that authorities at the jail have upgraded his status from category B to category A , meaning he is now entitled to make more phone calls , wear jewellery , own a radio , and hug his visitors â€ “ the last apparently confirmed by his brother , Carl Pistorius : This week ,
South Africaâ€ ™ s Daily Sun published footage of Pistorius playing football in a prison yard with Radovan Krejcir , a Czech prisoner held on charges of kidnapping , attempted murder and drug dealing : Roux is finished .
Court breaks as Judge Masipa leaves the room to consider her decision .
She asks for â€œa few minutesâ€ � .
Roux goes on â€ “ he says the trial court made a finding in granting the application to the state in December that the issues raised could be matters of law .
The court was right to dismiss the stateâ€ ™ s attempt to secure leave to appeal against the five - year sentence , Roux adds .
But he says he must have leave from this court in order to argue in the supreme court that the state challenge over the murder charge acquittal is based on matters of fact , not law .
Nel sits down .
Barry Roux is on his feet again .
He says he is obliged to ask for this leave : Itâ€ ™ s not an appeal , itâ€ ™ s a substantive application .
( Itâ€ ™ s unclear at this stage whether anyone understands what the difference is . )
Nel :
In conclusion , this case should be struck off the roll .
In fact , it should be stronger than that , he adds : The court should make it clear that it will not entertain applications for leave against leave .
Nel says the result of an application of this nature is that the case â€œwill become never - ending â€ ¦ where will it stop?â€
�
Nel cites various other cases to support his argument that the court today is not entitled to grant the defence leave to appeal against the stateâ€ ™ s appeal .
There is no â€œprescription in the lawâ€ � , he tells the judge .
Nel says Masipa does not have the right to grant the leave .
There is no provision to even hear the current application , he argues .
Masipa is making a lot of notes as she listens .
Nel :
To grant leave to appeal â€ ¦ is not a final order
â€ ¦
Itâ€ ™ s a process where one approaches the court and applies for leave to address a specific point in the SCA [ supreme court of appeal ] later .
The accused has a right to argue whatever he wants .
Nel says that Masipa did not decide , in granting the state leave to appeal , that the state was right in its arguments on the point of law ( on dolus directus ) , merely that there was â€œa reasonable possibilityâ€
� that another court would reach a different interpretation .
Nel says the defence is asking the court to grant leave for something it already has leave to do .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ lawyers can already argue their point in the supreme court .
This â€œleave against leaveâ€ � is â€œridiculousâ€ � .
Legally , appeals to the supreme court must be on a point of law , not on factual matters , Roux contends .
He says the defence needs leave from Judge Masipa in order to argue at the Supreme Court that this is a factual matter .
It needs this to be in an equal position when it comes before the Supreme Court , Roux insists .
Roux sits down .
Gerrie Nel , for the state , is straight up on his feet .
The judge should strike this claim out , he says .
Barry Roux , lead counsel for Pistorius , speaks first .
He says he is not intending to appeal against the stateâ€ ™ s appeal .
He says that the stateâ€ ™ s appeal going to the Supreme Court would be a factual matter â€œdisguisedâ€ � as a point of law .
Judge Masipa has arrived and the court is in session .
June Steenkamp , the mother of Reeva Steenkamp , was a regular attendee at the high court in Pretoria during Pistoriusâ€ ™ trial .
But she is unlikely to be here today .
She told my colleague David Smith last month :
Iâ€ ™ m not focusing my life any more on Oscar .
If by law they condemn him to a longer sentence , thatâ€ ™
s got nothing to do with me .
What happens to Oscar now happens to Oscar .
It isnâ€ ™ t going to affect me .
Reeva is never going to walk through that door again .
Iâ€ ™ m not a vengeful person and I donâ€
™ t wish ill on anyone .
The appeal is up to the law .
The law must take its course and God must take his course .
It is still early but so far the scene at court does not resemble those seen during Pistoriusâ€ ™ original trial .
Karyn Maughan , a reporter for eNCA news in Johannesburg , is in court : Lawyers for Pistorius , headed by lead counsel Barry Roux , are also in the court room .
In the hearing last December , lead prosecutor Gerrie Nel said the court had erred in its application of the principles of dolus eventualis , because the accused should have known that firing four shots through a toilet cubicle door would result in death , even if he did not â€œwish the resultâ€ � .
Pistorius should have been found guilty of murder , he contended .
Nel also argued that the five - year sentence imposed on Pistorius was
â€œshockingly inappropriateâ€ � and a different court would be likely to impose a harsher punishment .
The defence opposed the state application .
Judge Masipa did , however , allow the request by prosecutors to appeal against the acquittal on the charge of murder : I can not say ... that the prospect of success at the Supreme Court of Appeal is remote â€
¦
I am also of the view ... this might have a practical effect .
The application therefore in respect of count one is decided in favour of the applicant [ the state ] .
But she refused to allow the state to challenge the five - year sentence imposed for the culpable homicide : I am not persuaded that there was any material misdirection or irregularity , or that on the facts of this matter the sentence imposed was shockingly inappropriate .
The supreme court is due to hear the prosecution appeal later this year .
Lawyers for Oscar Pistorius will today argue that Judge Thokozile Masipa was wrong when , in December last year , she granted prosecutors permission to appeal against her verdict that the Paralympian was guilty of the culpable homicide â€ “ but not the murder â€ “ of Reeva Steenkamp .
Steenkamp was killed when Pistorius , her boyfriend , fired four shots through a locked toilet door in the early hours of 14 February 2013 .
He maintained that he had mistaken her for an intruder .
In September 2014 , Pistorius was cleared by the judge of a charge of murder , but convicted of a lesser charge of culpable homicide ( manslaughter ) .
Masipa decided that he could not be found guilty of murder by dolus directus ( premeditated ) or dolus eventualis ( that he foresaw that shooting four bullets through the door would lead to death , but went ahead anyway ) : It can not be said that he foresaw that the deceased or anyone else would be killed when he fired shots at the toilet door .
But in December , both sides , along with Masipa , returned to court , with prosecutors arguing that the judge had made a mistake in acquitting Pistorius of the more serious charge .
An appeal can only be granted on a question of law , not on factual findings .
Masipa agreed with the prosecutorsâ€ ™ contention that the verdict was based on her interpretation of law â€ “ notably , the application of the principle of dolus eventualis .
Today the defence will seek to cast doubt on this at the South Gauteng high court in Johannesburg around 9 am ( 7 am GMT/6pm AEDT ) .
â€œWe will argue that these are matters of fact , rather than matters of law ,
â€ �
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s lawyer Brian Webber said when the defence announced last month its decision to challenge the ruling .
We will have live updates here throughout the hearing .
I will also be tweeting key developments @Claire_Phipps .

2015-03-13,"A judge has thrown out an attempt by Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ s lawyers to challenge a prosecution appeal against his acquittal of murder .
Thokozile Masipa , who presided over the athleteâ€ ™ s original trial , said she could not be asked to rule on her decision to grant the appeal , which will be heard at the supreme court at a later date .
Pistorius , known as the Blade Runner , is serving a five - year jail sentence for shooting dead his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , but could be moved to house arrest in August .
Masipa ruled in December that state prosecutors could appeal against her verdict of culpable homicide â€ “ the South African equivalent of manslaughter â€ “ and seek to have it upgraded to murder , which carries a heavier jail term .
Masipa agreed with the prosecutors that the verdict was based on her interpretation of law .
An appeal can only be granted on a question of law rather than fact .
On Friday , Pistoriusâ€ ™ s defence team requested leave from Masipa to argue that the state challenge was based on matters of fact , not law .
At the high court in Johannesburg , defence counsel Barry Roux denied he was appealing against the appeal .
But he claimed that the stateâ€ ™ s appeal would be a factual matter â€œdisguisedâ€ � as a point of law .
It was his legal obligation to raise this argument to make sure he would be able to make these points at the supreme court , he added .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel dismissed the application as â€œridiculousâ€ � , adding that itwould â€œbecome neverending â€ ¦ where will it stop?â€
� .
There was no reason why the defence could not raise its arguments in the supreme court , he added .
â€œIn conclusion , this case should be struck off the roll â€ ¦
The court should make it clear that it will not entertain applications for leave against leave.â€ �
After a short deliberation , Masipa agreed , concluding :
â€œI am not satisfied that this is the correct court to hear this application .
For one thing , there is really nothing new in the submissions by counsel for the applicant .
In my view , to entertain this application will be tantamount to reviewing my own decision .
â€œAnd I also think that , procedurally , it would be wrong to grant or refuse this application .
Accordingly , the order that I grant in this matter , is to strike off the application.â€ �
Although unsuccessful , the application represented something of an insurance policy for the defence , allowing it to tell the supreme court it exhausted every avenue in seeking to challenge the appeal decision .
Marius du Toit , an attorney , told eNews Channel Africa that it was all about Roux â€œdotting his iâ€ ™ s and crossing his tâ€ ™ sâ€
� .
Unlike Pistoriusâ€ ™ s trial , Fridayâ€ ™ s short hearing was held in Johannesburg because Masipa is usually based there .
Pistorius , his family and Steenkampâ€ ™ s family were not there .
Pistorius testified during his trial that he shot Steenkamp believing she was an intruder , while the state argued he deliberately killed the 29-year - old law graduate and model after an argument .
If an appeal court found him guilty of murder , the former Olympian could face at least 15 years in prison .
Velekhaya Mgobhozi , a spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority ( NPA ) welcomed Masipaâ€ ™ s decision .
â€œThe court today has agreed with the NPA this matter should not be heard by this court ,
â€ � he said .
â€œWe have always argued this court can not go back on its word.â€ �
Mgobhozi said the NPA will be asked to submit a transcript of the trial in late May and heads of argument within a month or two , before the supreme court sets a date for the appeal in the city of Bloemfontein .
It seems increasingly likely that Pistorius will have been switched to house arrest by then .
â€œItâ€ ™ s in the hands of correctional services , â€ � Mgobhozi added .
â€œWe have no control over time frames.â€ �"
2015-04-14,"As Oscar Pistorius wilted in the witness box , she exuded calm authority in a courtroom where all deferred to her as â€œMaâ€ ™ amâ€ � .
One year on , however , it was the judge Thokozile Masipa who found herself under gruelling cross - examination during a job interview .
Masipa , 67 , is among seven candidates vying for the new position of the judge president of Limpopo province in South Africa .
On Monday night , the Judicial Service Commission ( JSC ) drew attention to a CV that includes one of the most eagerly watched trials in history â€ “ and one of the most contentious verdicts .
Masipa accepted Pistoriusâ€ ™ s explanation last year that he shot dead his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , after mistaking her for an intruder .
She acquitted the Paralympian of murder and instead found him guilty of culpable homicide , the South African equivalent of manslaughter , and sentenced him to five years in prison .
The verdict was criticised by Steenkampâ€ ™ s family and campaigners against gender violence .
Mathole Motshekga , an MP for the governing African National Congress ( ANC ) , suggested the controversy could result in a backlash against the new court .
According to the Rand Daily Mail website , he asked Masipa : â€œWhat will you do to ensure that the new court doesnâ€ ™ t start to deal with the negative image
â€ ¦ donâ€
™ t you think that that stigma will challenge the image of the new court and if it doesâ€š what will you do to ensure that the image of that court doesnâ€ ™ t suffer?â€ �
Masipa rejected the premise that she had a negative image .
â€œI do not think the criticism was about me at all , â€ �
she replied .
â€œIt was about the outcome .
Because people were expecting a different outcome , they were just expressing frustration .
I donâ€
™ t think Iâ€ ™ m stigmatised â€ ¦ perhaps I am too naive about that .
â€œSince Pistorius I have been given other cases .
The counsel that have appeared before me still give me the same respect before and after.â€ �
Michael Masutha ,
South Africaâ€ ™ s justice minister , said Masipa , who grew up in Soweto township , was now â€œone of the most famous judges in the worldâ€ � and Mogoeng Mogoeng , the chief justice , asked her to explain how she dealt with the attacks since she gained her unlikely celebrity status .
Masipa , a former journalist who suffered detention during the apartheid era , said : â€œA judge must respect criticism .
It is not personal .
When someone expressed their frustration you should just let them â€ ¦ judges have been attacked all over ...
we are not on the bench to please people , we are not there to win a popularity contest .
We are there to do a job and , once you know youâ€ ™ ve done your job , there really isnâ€ ™ t anything to worry about.â€ �
However , Mike Hellens , a barrister who sits on the commission , asked how Masipa could be a judge president of a court when she could not control the lawyers in the Pistorius trial .
Meanwhile , another commissioner , Julius Malema , the firebrand who leads the Economic Freedom Fighters , grilled Masipa over why she was seeking the job when she was nearing retirement .
He asked : â€œYou are left with two years , and then after that we must go and get another judge .
Donâ€ ™ t you think it is better for this commission to go for someone who can stay for a longer period?â€ �
Masipa responded : â€œTwo years is a very long time .
When I leave there would be no instabilities.â€
�
The commission sat until midnight on Monday .
Of 23 candidates shortlisted for the various judge and judge president positions , only four are women .
The prosecution in the Pistorius trial is appealing against Masipaâ€ ™ s ruling .
It is expected to be reviewed by the supreme court of appeal later this year ."
2015-06-08,"The parents of Reeva Steenkamp , who was shot dead by her boyfriend , Oscar Pistorius , have condemned a decision to free the Paralympian on parole in August when he will have served just 10 months in prison .
Pistorius , jailed for five years last October for culpable homicide , the South African equivalent of manslaughter , will be eligible for release to house arrest having served a sixth of his sentence and shown good behaviour .
But the parole board at his prison overruled an emotional plea from the 29-year - old victimâ€ ™ s parents when it sat last week .
In their submission , Barry and June Steenkamp said : â€œWe have forgiven Mr Pistorius even though he took the life of our precious daughter , Reeva .
Our lives will never be the same as we live with the sadness of her death every day .
â€œReeva had so much to offer this world and we were all robbed of her life when she was killed .
As her family , we do not seek to avenge her death and we do not want Mr Pistorius to suffer ; that will not bring her back to us .
However , a person found guilty of a crime must be held accountable for their actions.â€ �
The Steenkamps added : â€œStatistics show that our society is under continuous attack from criminals and murderers .
Incarceration of 10 months for taking a life is simply not enough .
We fear that this will not send out the proper message and serve as the deterrent it should.â€ �
Pistorius , now 28 , became a global sports star known as the Blade Runner after competing in the Paralympics and Olympics on prosthetic limbs .
He killed Steenkamp , a model and law graduate , by shooting four times through a locked toilet door at his home in Pretoria on Valentineâ€ ™ s Day 2013 .
In a trial that gripped millions , the court accepted his explanation that he had mistaken her for a burglar and therefore did not convict him of murder .
Due to his physical disability , Pistorius has been held since 21 October in the hospital ward of Kgosi Mampuru II prison in Pretoria .
On Monday the Department of Correctional Services said the prisonâ€ ™ s parole board had met last week â€œand approved the placement of Oscar Pistorius under correctional supervision with effect from 21 August 2015â€ � .
This is in line with legislation stating that â€œan offender may serve only one sixth of his / her sentence in custody , and continue to serve the remaining period of the sentence under correctional supervisionâ€ � , it added .
â€œThe family of the victim was invited and participated in the deliberationsâ€ � of the parole board .
Legal experts say the recommendation is highly unlikely to be opposed .
It means that Pistorius will probably be switched to house arrest with one hour of free time each day , and gradually these conditions will be relaxed , for example allowing him to go to church but not socialise at night .
The Steenkamps declined to comment further on Monday but their lawyer , Tania Koen , said : â€œThey are shocked by the fact that Oscar Pistorius will be receiving parole and going out on 21 August .
They donâ€
™ t think 10 months is enough for taking a life .
Whether it was Reeva behind the door or anybody else behind that door , it doesnâ€
™ t send out a proper message and it doesnâ€ ™ t serve as a deterrent.â€ � June Steenkamp was discharged from hospital on Sunday after a major operation , Koen added .
â€œSheâ€ ™ s not in a good place .
Sheâ€ ™ s very fragile at the moment.â€

The parole decision has been condemned by gender rights activists , who note that South Africa has one of the highest rates of intimate partner homicide in the world .
In 2009 it was estimated that a woman was killed by her husband or boyfriend every eight hours â€ “ more commonly than by strangers .
Rachel Jewkes , director of gender and health research at the South African Medical Research Council , said : â€œItâ€ ™ s a complete travesty .
It sends out a message that , with the right resources , you can kill a woman with impunity .
Itâ€ ™ s a setback for the campaign against gender violence in South Africa .
â€œThere have been some very high - profile cases recently serving to remind us what a terrific problem we have of men killing their nearest and dearest in this country.â€
�
Jewkes added : â€œI feel hugely for Reevaâ€ ™ s parents going through the trauma of the loss and the trauma of the trial and now this terrible sense that justice has not been done.â€ �
But Pistorius can not take freedom for granted .
It was also announced on Monday that an appeal against his culpable homicide conviction will be heard in November , when prosecutors will argue that judge Thokozile Masipa misinterpreted the law and should have found him guilty of murder .
If the supreme court of appeal agrees , Pistorius would face the prospect of being sent back to prison for a minimum of 15 years .
â€œA specific date has not been set yet , but we can confirm that the appeal will happen in November this year , â€ � a supreme court official , who declined to be named , told Agence France - Presse .
Anneliese Burgess , a spokesperson for the Pistorius family , said on Monday : â€œWe note the statements made by Correctional Services as reported in the press today , but as the family , we will not be commenting on this matter.â€ �"
2015-06-09,"Reeva Steenkamp died alone and terrified .
She was 29 , and should have been able to look forward to many years of life .
Instead , she died behind a locked toilet door that could not protect her from a man armed with a powerful weapon .
It has now been revealed that her killer , the Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius , is likely to be released from prison in August this year , after serving only 10 months of a five - year sentence for culpable homicide .
This turn of events , while hardly unexpected , speaks volumes about attitudes towards male violence in South Africa .
That Pistorius could be released so soon also says a great deal about the capacity of celebrity to obliterate other narratives , even in a country where three women are killed each day by their husbands or boyfriends .
Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents have condemned the decision by the parole board to release their daughterâ€ ™ s killer to house arrest .
The fact that the athlete shot his girlfriend has never been in doubt , although Pistorius has always claimed he mistook her for a burglar in the early hours of the morning .
He was cleared of murder last autumn .
Once he is moved to house arrest , Pistorius could even be allowed to start training again .
It has always been clear that the relevant authorities do not regard his conviction for culpable homicide as a disqualification for an international sporting career , with the International Paralympic Committee announcing immediately after the verdict that he would be allowed to compete again , although not until 2019 .
There is a potential obstacle in his way , however , with the prosecutionâ€ ™ s appeal against his acquittal on the murder charge due to be heard in November .
The case remains controversial for very good reasons .
From the moment news of the killing broke in February 2013 , Pistorius was given a sympathetic hearing by much of the worldâ€ ™ s press .
Long before the case came to court , reporters uncritically repeated his defence , framing the story as a piece of tragic news involving a world - famous athlete and divorcing it from any wider context .
That context is very well - known to doctors and campaigners against domestic violence .
So many women are killed by their husbands and boyfriends in South Africa that the crime is regarded by some commentators as amounting to femicide â€ “ the intentional murder of women simply because they are women .
Many observers have commented on the danger posed to women by a culture where guns and masculinity are perilously entwined .
According to an article published in the South African Medical Journal in 2010 , the country has â€œthe highest reported rate globally of females murdered by shooting in a country not engaged in warâ€ � .
Most of the victims are poor and either black or mixed race .
If campaigners hoped that Steenkampâ€ ™ s death would at least shine a much - needed light on this grim situation , they were to be for the most part frustrated .
She was an atypical victim â€ “ white , middle - class and well known as a model â€ “
but even she stood no chance against the fame of her killer .
In the aftermath of her death she was referred to in many reports as the athleteâ€ ™ s unnamed girlfriend , prompting a Twitter hashtag that pointedly reminded the world that she had her own identity .
As Pistorius looks forward to leaving prison in just over two monthsâ€ ™ time , itâ€ ™ s worth recalling that he made no attempt to check who was behind the door of the toilet in his Pretoria mansion before he fired .
He had loaded his 9 mm pistol with hollow - point ammunition , which is designed to mushroom inside body tissue , causing maximum damage .
According to evidence given in court , one shot to Steenkampâ€ ™ s arm would have acted â€œlike an instant amputationâ€ � .
Pistorius sobbed and vomited his way through his trial as though he , rather than the woman he killed , deserved public sympathy .
Now it seems as though those tearful histrionics have served their purpose .
In a country where gender inequality is entrenched , this is how easy it is for a well - known man to usurp the role of victim ."
2015-08-17,"Prosecutors filed an appeal on Monday calling for Oscar Pistorius , who is days away from being released from prison , to be convicted of the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp .
The Paralympian was jailed last year for five years after being convicted on the lesser charge of culpable homicide , the South African equivalent of manslaughter .
He is set to be paroled on Friday after serving 10 months behind bars , but will remain under a form of house arrest .
He is expected to stay at his uncle
Arnoldâ€ ™ s three - storey mansion in a wealthy suburb of Pretoria .
He is likely to be allowed to leave the house to work , carry out community service or to attend important family events , and officials say he will not have to wear an electronic monitoring device .
The state filed its heads of argument with the supreme court of appeal .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s defence team has until 17 September to submit its response , with the appeal hearing expected in November .
If the judges rule against Pistorius , he could face returning to prison for at least 15 years .
The double amputee , who became a sporting celebrity after competing in the Paralympics and Olympics , told his high profile trial that he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder when he fired four shots through a locked toilet door on Valentineâ€ ™ s Day in 2013 .
The state is appealing against the culpable homicide verdict , arguing that Pistorius deliberately killed Steenkamp , a model and law graduate who would have turned 32 this Wednesday , after an argument .
It has described his sentence as â€œshockingly inappropriateâ€ � .
Because of his physical disability , Pistorius has been held since 21 October in the hospital ward of Kgosi Mampuru II prison in Pretoria .
He is eligible for release in line with guidelines that say non - dangerous prisoners should spend only a sixth of a custodial sentence behind bars .
The 28-year - old is to leave prison on Friday after the parole board agreed to place him under â€œcorrectional supervisionâ€ � .
Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents , Barry and June , have objected to Pistoriusâ€ ™ s release .
â€œStatistics show that our society is under continuous attack from criminals and murderers , â€ � they wrote earlier this year .
â€œIncarceration of 10 months for taking a life is simply not enough .
We fear that this will not send out the proper message and serve as the deterrent it should.â€ �"
2015-08-18,"A government minister in South Africa has cast doubt on the planned release of Oscar Pistorius from prison on Friday .
Michael Masutha , the justice minister , said he was seeking legal advice on whether the Paralympian â€ “ convicted of killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in 2013 â€ “ should switch to a form of house arrest after serving 10 months behind bars .
Masutha was speaking in response to a petition by a rights group claiming that granting Pistorius parole during womenâ€ ™ s month in South Africa would undermine efforts to curb gender violence .
â€œIâ€ ™ m confident that by Friday I will be in a position to determine whether legally I have the authority to do anything , whether it would be appropriate or actually necessary by law for me to do anything in relation to what was announced by the Department [ of Correctional Services ] as the imminent release of Mr Pistorius by this Friday , â€ � the minister told eNews Channel Africa .
â€œIâ€ ™
ll tell you what concerns me most is that if we say this is the law , we must be sure that this indeed is the law , because it would be egg on our face if it turns out that actually weâ€ ™ ve misinterpreted the law .
My starting point is upholding the rule of law .
Thatâ€ ™ s what the constitution requires , nothing to do with publicity , with the fact that itâ€ ™ s a high - profile matter.â€
�
The release of Pistorius , who was jailed for five years after being found guilty of culpable homicide , is in line with South African sentencing guidelines that say non - dangerous prisoners should spend only one - sixth of their sentence in custody before moving to â€œcorrectional supervisionâ€ � .
William Booth , a lawyer , said :
â€œItâ€ ™ s pretty standard .
The normal position is that someone with this sentence can be released after one - sixth of it , depending on the behaviour of the prisoner.â€ � Pistoriusâ€ ™ s defence team might contest any intervention by the minister , arguing that he was sentenced under section 276(1)(i ) of the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977 and therefore is eligible for parole .
One source close to Pistorius said : â€œIâ€ ™ m stunned .
I really think
itâ€ ™ s rubbish .
I just canâ€ ™ t see
it.â€ �
The petition to Masutha from an umbrella group known as the Progressive Womenâ€ ™ s Movement of South Africa says : â€œWe are shocked about the insensitiveness of the parole board to release Oscar Pistorius during womenâ€ ™ s month .
This decision of the parole board is outrageous and an affront to the aim of womenâ€ ™ s month.â€ �
It continues : â€œThe policy that provides that an offender will have to serve at least one - sixth of his sentence before applying to be placed under correctional supervision should not be applied as a fit - one - fit - all approach .
Violence against women and children is rife in South Africa ; therefore such crimes , despite the sentences they attracted as a result of the technicalities , must be treated with the seriousness they deserve .
â€œFurther , whilst we acknowledge Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ s constitutional right to be considered for parole like any other offender , it is our submission that placing him under correctional supervision during womenâ€ ™ s month will be an insult to the victims of women and child abuse and the women of South Africa in general â€ ¦
This is not emotional but factual .
Violence against women will not be eradicated if this is the attitude of the criminal justice system.â€
�
If his release goes ahead , Pistorius will be mostly confined to the home of his uncle Arnold in an upmarket suburb of Pretoria .
The high - walled mansion has more than a dozen bedrooms , a private gym , outdoor swimming pool and landscaped gardens .
Pistorius was cleared of murder after telling his trial how he had mistaken Steenkamp for a burglar .
Prosecutors have filed an appeal against his culpable homicide conviction in the hope that it will be altered to murder , which would carry a heavier sentence .
The appeal will be heard in November ."
2015-08-19,"Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ s release from prison has been put on hold by the South African government .
The Paralympian , convicted of culpable homicide for the killing of his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , was due to be moved to house arrest on Friday after serving 10 months behind bars .
But Michael Masutha , the justice minister , has referred the matter back to the parole review board , sowing legal confusion and doubts over the release date .
Mthunzi Mhaga , spokesman for the Justice Department , said the date would have to be reviewed again because the athlete was approved to be moved to house arrest too soon .
Pistorius should have served 10 months , or one - sixth , of his five - year sentence before being considered for release , Mhaga said .
But he was approved for parole in June , eight months into his sentence .
It is unclear when the parole board will meet to consider Pistorius for release , but it is unlikely that a new decision will be made before Fridayâ€ ™ s initially planned release date .
Ian Levitt , a lawyer who attended the trial , praised the ministerâ€ ™ s intervention .
â€œThe minister was acting prudently , acting responsibly , â€ � he told the eNews Channel Africa .
â€œHe did exactly what he is entitled to do .
The ultimate decision rests with the minister.â€ � Masutha received a petition on Monday from the Progressive Womenâ€ ™ s Movement of South Africa expressing opposition to the release of Pistorius during the countryâ€ ™ s Womenâ€ ™ s Month .
Asked about the timing of his intervention , Masutha , speaking from Cape Town , explained : â€œOrdinarily I do not consider decisions of parole boards â€ ¦
In this instance I had representations two days ago from a womenâ€ ™ s rights organisation which requested that I review the decision.â€
�
The organisationâ€ ™ s argument that Pistorius should not be released in Womenâ€ ™ s Month was â€œnot sound in lawâ€ � , he added , but prompted him to study the parole decision and find fault in its timing .
â€œI donâ€
™ t go around looking at cases and checking whether they have been dealt with in compliance with the law .
Itâ€ ™ s only when a matter has been brought to my attention that I would deal with that.â€
�
A statement from the Department of Justice and Correctional Services cited a law stating that a person sentenced to imprisonment must serve at least one - sixth of his or her sentence before being considered for â€œcorrectional supervisionâ€ � , a form of house arrest .
It said : â€œThe decision to release him on 21 August 2015 was made prematurely on 5 June 2015 when the offender was not eligible to be considered at all ...
One - sixth of a five - year sentence is 10 months , and at the time the decision was made , Mr Pistorius had served only six months of his sentence.â€ � Pistoriusâ€ ™ s aunt , Lois , said :
â€œWeâ€ ™ ll wait for the people to decide .
Iâ€ ™ ve just heard the news and havenâ€ ™ t had time to think what Iâ€ ™ m going to say .
Itâ€ ™ s not in my hands as Mrs Pistorius to comment or say anything about it.â€ �
Another family member , who did not wish to be named , said the family would accept the decision and seek legal advice on the available options .
The Womenâ€ ™ s League of the governing African National Congress welcomed the ruling .
It said : â€œThe ANC Womenâ€ ™ s League remains convinced that Judge [ Thokozile ] Masipa handed down an erroneous judgment and an extremely lenient sentence to Pistorius â€ ¦ setting a bad precedent in cases involving gender - based violence , especially in instances where women die at the hands of their partners .
It is our wish that Pistorius remains in custody until November when the supreme court of appeal will hear the appeal brought by the NPA [ National Prosecuting Authority ] against the judgment and the sentence.â€ � Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents , Barry and June , marked what would have been their daughterâ€ ™ s birthday on Wednesday by visiting a beach in Port Elizabeth where she used to walk .
They said in a statement this week : â€œWe are still struggling with coming to terms with losing our precious daughter Reeva and her loss is felt even more this week as we would have celebrated her 32nd birthday on 19 August .
As a family , we want to continue to honour Reevaâ€ ™ s memory by focusing on the Reeva Rebecca Steenkamp Foundation , celebrating her life , what she stood for and the joy she brought into so many lives.â€ �
Earlier this year , in a submission to the parole board that considered Pistoriusâ€ ™ s release , the family made their feelings clear : â€œStatistics show that our society is under continuous attack from criminals and murderers .
Incarceration of 10 months for taking a life is simply not enough .
We fear that this will not send out the proper message and serve as the deterrent it should.â€ � Pistorius was acquitted of murder but convicted of culpable homicide , the South African equivalent of manslaughter , after a globally televised trial accepted his plea that he shot four times through a locked toilet door because he mistook Steenkamp for a burglar ."
2015-08-27,"Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ s parole review has been set for 18 September , meaning the athlete will spend at least another three weeks in jail , his family has said .
Pistorius , who was convicted of culpable homicide for killing his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , was due to be moved to house arrest last Friday after serving 10 months behind bars .
But Michael Masutha , the justice minister , referred the matter back to the parole review board .

Pistorius should have served 10 months , or one - sixth of his five - year sentence before being considered for release , a justice department spokesman said last week .
But he was approved for parole in June , eight months into his sentence .
Pistorius is set to remain in jail as the review panel , which includes three judges , could take weeks or even months to make its decision .
â€œWe do understand that the parole board will be sitting on the 18th of September , â€ � said a family spokesman on Thursday .
â€œThat date has been set.â€ � Pistorius was acquitted of murder but convicted of culpable homicide , the South African equivalent of manslaughter , after a globally televised trial accepted his plea that he shot four times through a locked toilet door because he mistook Steenkamp for a burglar ."
2015-10-09,"A parole hearing to decide if Oscar Pistorius should be released from prison before serving the full five - year sentence for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp has been postponed , a spokeswoman for his family said .
In the latest stage of a lengthy battle over his sentence , the hearing had been scheduled for Friday .
South African media said the postponement was to allow Steenkampâ€ ™ s family to provide submissions .
â€œIt has been postponed until 21 October .
I have not been given the official reason for this , â€ � the family spokeswoman , Anneliese Burgess , told Reuters .
The Paralympianâ€ ™ s lawyers argue that he should have been allowed out on house arrest in August after serving more than 10 months of his sentence for killing Steenkamp on Valentineâ€ ™ s Day in 2013 .
But he has remained in jail after the justice minister , Michael Masutha , made a last - minute intervention and the case was referred for review .
Earlier this week , Pistoriusâ€ ™ s family accused officials of bowing to â€œpolitical and media hypeâ€ � after the starâ€ ™ s release was delayed again .
Pistorius was found guilty of culpable homicide â€ “ a charge equivalent to manslaughter â€
“ after saying he shot Steenkamp through a locked bathroom door because he mistook her for an intruder .
Pistorius faces a further test on 3 November when prosecutors will appeal to South Africaâ€ ™ s supreme court to try to secure a murder conviction and a stronger sentence .
Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents have opposed parole for the athlete .

2015-10-12,"Two South Africans who rented the former home of disgraced athlete Oscar Pistorius have been forced to apologise after posting a video they made of the property , including inside the bathroom where the Paralympian shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp .
David Scott , 33 , and Kagiso Mokoape , 23 , who are leasing the house at Silver Woods country estate in Pretoria where Pistorius killed model Steenkamp in 2013 , boasted of the parties they could hold there .
â€œThis is definitely an entertainerâ€ ™ s house .
Oscar built this house to entertain , â€ �
Scott is seen saying on the YouTube video , as he holds a can of beer .
â€œHot girls can invite themselves.â€
� â€œEvery weekend
it is going to go down here , â€ � Mokoape added .
The house was reportedly sold to an unnamed mining consultant to pay for Pistoriusâ€ ™ s legal costs .
The video then shows the two men in the bathroom where Pistorius shot Steenkamp through a locked toilet door in the early hours of Valentineâ€ ™ s Day .
Pistorius was found guilty last year of culpable homicide â€ “ a charge equivalent to manslaughter â€ “ after saying he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder .
He was sentenced to five years in prison and was due for parole in August but his release has been delayed by an ongoing legal battle .
Scott initially responded to the news reports about his video with a message on his Facebook wall , half in Afrikaans and half in English , saying : â€œI am dying of laughter , this is a bit out of proportion , well , u know what they say ...
thereâ€
™ s no such thing as bad publicity !
He he.â€
�
But he later added an apology , saying the video had sent â€œtotally wrong messageâ€ � .
â€œThe house is about celebrating life and to be reminded about how precious it is !
Not to make a mockery , â€ � he said .
The original videoâ€ ™ s YouTube settings have since been made private .
The parole board is due to meet again on Thursday to reconsider Pistoriusâ€ ™ s case for release on house arrest ."
2015-10-15,"Oscar Pistorius is to be released from prison and into house arrest next week , 12 months after he was sentenced to five years for killing his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp .
In a statement , South Africaâ€ ™ s department of correctional services said the 28-year - old Paralympian would be released on Tuesday and placed under supervision .
It indicated that Pistorius has been a good inmate and qualifies for house arrest , a routine procedure in South Africa .
Full details of the conditions were not revealed by the corrections department , although it did say that Pistorius would have to continue receiving psychotherapy and would not be allowed to possess a firearm .
Criminal lawyer David Dadic said :
â€œHeâ€ ™ s not â€˜outâ€ ™ on parole â€ ¦ heâ€
™ s having his sentence converted to a house arrest sentence .
Heâ€
™ s now confined to a house for a period .
Theyâ€ ™ ll confine him essentially to what he would be doing in prison but in the confines of his own house.â€ �
After a seven - month trial , Pistorius was convicted in September last year of killing Steenkamp on Valentineâ€ ™ s Day in 2013 .
He was found guilty of culpable homicide , a charge equivalent to manslaughter , after saying during the trial that he shot his girlfriend through a locked bathroom door because he mistook her for an intruder .
He was due to be moved to house arrest in August after serving 10 months behind bars , but Michael Masutha , the justice minister , referred the matter back to the parole review board , sowing legal confusion and doubts over the release date .
A parole hearing to decide whether Pistorius should be released from prison early was postponed last week .
Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents say Pistorius killed their daughter on purpose and have consistently opposed parole .
Steenkamp would have turned 32 in August .
That month , her mother , June Steenkamp , told a South African tabloid : â€œFor our beautiful daughter â€ “ for anyoneâ€ ™ s life â€ “
itâ€ ™
s definitely not long enough .
She was robbed of her future , her career , her chance to get married and have a baby.â€ �
On 3 November prosecutors will appeal to South Africaâ€ ™ s supreme court to try to secure a murder conviction and a stronger sentence for Pistorius .
If they win their case , he could face at least 15 years in jail .
â€œI think the chances are pretty good that the appeals court will rule in favour of the state and overturn the verdict , â€ � said Ulrich Roux , a criminal lawyer in Johannesburg .
â€œHe is faced with the unusual circumstance that heâ€ ™ s released on house arrest and then the court could find him guilty of murder and heâ€ ™ ll have to return to prison.â€ � Pistorius , whose legs were amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old , has no immediate hope of salvaging his athletic career whatever the outcome of the appeal .
There is speculation that he will serve his house arrest at his uncleâ€ ™ s house â€ “ a mansion in an upmarket Pretoria suburb â€
“ where he lived during his trial .
His previous home , where he shot Steenkamp , was sold for Â£220,000 to pay his legal fees .
Martin Hood , another criminal lawyer in Johannesburg , said : â€œI think
heâ€
™ s going to come out very quietly , and very discreetly and heâ€
™ s going to disappear and stay off the radar .
If he breaches any of his conditions heâ€ ™ ll lose his house arrest.â€ �
A typical offender under house arrest has his movements restricted and is not allowed to drink alcohol , but conditions vary widely .
â€œHe may have an electronic tag and he would also be subject to correctional services visits , â€ � Hood said , adding that Pistorius could have to serve community service in a hospital or morgue .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s trial exposed the athleteâ€ ™ s darker side , offering glimpses of a dangerously volatile man with a penchant for guns , women and fast cars .
The athlete sobbed and vomited in the dock as details of his loverâ€ ™ s brutal death were examined in detail during the trial .
Zach Modise , correctional services head , said Pistorius , who has been housed in Pretoriaâ€ ™ s Kgosi Mampuru II prison , initially wrestled with his sentence , but then committed to reform .
â€œAt the beginning
he could not understand that you get locked up in a cell .
He struggled with that , â€ � Modise told South Africaâ€ ™ s Sunday Times .
â€œI think
heâ€
™ s getting to understand you have to control your anger and temper .
I hope when he gets released on probation he will be able to conduct himself well.â€ �"
2015-10-16,"Next week Oscar Pistorius is to be released from prison and into house arrest after serving just 11 months of a five - year sentence for shooting and killing his partner , Reeva Steenkamp .
Sadly , the only thing that makes this case unusual is the high profile of the perpetrator .
Violence against women is a global problem and itâ€ ™ s particularly acute in South Africa , where a woman is killed by her partner every eight hours .
Globally , figures show that , when a woman is murdered , in more than a third of cases she was killed by their partner .
In South Africa , that rises to more than half .
One study claimed that the country has the highest reported rate of women murdered by shooting in a country not engaged in war .
Behind every statistic are individual women and girls whose names and stories will never be mentioned by the media or spark a public outcry .
Viewed collectively , those individual cases reveal a grim pattern of low conviction rates , short sentences , early release , and survivor - blaming from state officials .
A study by the South African Medical Research Council comparing prevalence and patterns of partner violence across South Africa in 1999 and 2009 found that in 10 years there was no evidence of improvement in police investigation of cases .
The message that violence against women isnâ€ ™ t something to be taken seriously allows a culture of impunity to flourish .
It prevents women and girls from coming forward to seek justice because they have seen the system fail so many others , creating a vicious circle of silence .
Governments have a human rights obligation to tackle violence against women and girls .
This includes delivering effective prosecution and punishment , coupled with efforts to prevent violence and support survivors .
Changes within the justice system arenâ€ ™ t enough .
Violence against women and girls is deeply rooted in gender inequality , unequal power , and dominant ideals of manhood that support violence and control over women .
To end abuse , governments must challenge individual attitudes and behaviours , and ultimately change social norms .
This may sound like a tall order , but it can be done and is â€ “ just not , on the whole , by governments .
Womankind research has highlighted the work of several womenâ€ ™ s rights organisations that are successfully delivering work to prevent violence against women and girls , including empowering women in their communities and convening community conversations .
States must also ensure female survivors can access quality services to respond to both short- and long - term needs and protect women from further violence .
The UN has stated that , where possible , services should be run by â€œindependent and experienced womenâ€ ™ s non - governmental organisations providing gender - specific , empowering and comprehensive support to women survivors of violence , based on feminist principlesâ€ � .
However , these organisations are critically underfunded .
In the UK alone , Womenâ€ ™ s Aid reported that in 2012 they were forced to turn away 320 women , just under 9 % of those seeking refuge , due to lack of space .
In 2011 , a global survey of 1,119 womenâ€ ™ s rights organisations from more than 140 countries , conducted by the Association of Womenâ€ ™ s Rights in Development , found that only one - tenth of the organisations received funding from bilateral , national governments and international NGOs and only 3 % from corporate funds .
Womenâ€ ™ s rights organisations around the world carry out life - saving work every day , and they have the expertise to stop violence before it starts .
With resources and political will , with commitment from governments to meet their human rights obligations and take violence against women seriously , the poisonous circle of silence and impunity can be broken .
Bethan Cansfield is Womankind Worldwideâ€ ™ s policy and advocacy manager"
2015-10-16,"It has been reported that Oscar Pistorius is to be released from prison next Tuesday , 12 months into his sentence for shooting Reeva Steenkamp .
Last October , I wrote that the sentence â€ “ despite being custodial â€ “ was worryingly short .
As June Steenkamp , Reevaâ€ ™ s mother said at the time , when it appeared that Pistorius was to be freed in August : â€œHe shot my daughter through that door where she had no space to move or defend herself .
One of the bullets blew her brains out , it is disgusting what he did to her â€ “ 10 months is just not enough.â€ � June Steenkamp was right .
It is still not enough .
Reeva died in a terrifying way , at the hands of someone she loved .
Unless her life weighs more heavily in the judicial balance than some of the so - called â€œreasonsâ€ � why she died â€ “ Pistoriusâ€ ™ s problems , his access to guns , his feelings of panic â€ “ we will never move to a culture that values womenâ€ ™ s lives enough to make them safer .
Because we donâ€ ™ t place a high enough value on womenâ€
™ s lives , we reinforce the entitlement men feel to act on the variety of reasons often used to justify violence and abuse : drink , drugs , peer pressure , having more money than sense , being young , feeling jealous , wanting their right to see their kids , what their victim was wearing , doing or saying .
This entitlement , this extensive menu of excuses , is reinforced day in and day out , around the world and in the UK , but inevitably high - profile cases have a particular impact , and I make no apology for focusing on their effect .
I fear that the â€œheroâ€ � culture that surrounds these famous men may be affecting criminal justice outcomes .
And through their profile this reinforces the dangerous misogyny in our culture .
Strong sentences are essential to show perpetrators of violence against women , and indeed women suffering abuse , that society and the law take their violence seriously .
Letâ€ ™ s just remind ourselves of some events of the last few months .
Danny Simpson , a Leicester City footballer , was convicted of seriously assaulting his ex - partner .
He pinned her to the ground and throttled her .
Simpson has not yet been sacked from the club , and was handed a community sentence by the courts .
The boxer Floyd Mayweather â€ “ a serial perpetrator of domestic violence
â€ “ was hailed a hero after winning a major fight against Manny Pacquiao in May.
The fight was one of the most lucrative sporting events of all time .
Mayweather has never shown remorse for his serious and sustained attacks against women , and has even made excuses for his crimes .
Bill Cosby is only now facing the consequences of allegations of sexual assault and rape against a huge number of women â€ “ some of the claims going back 40 or so years .
Why did it take so long ?
Because Cosby was an adored American hero .
One woman , Barbara Bowman , wrote , â€œOnly when a male comedian ( Hannibal Buress ) called Cosby a rapist did the accusation take hold.â€
�
It took 30 years for people to take her seriously .
To list the cases of all high - profile men who have abused with impunity would take too long .
What Iâ€ ™ m waiting for is some evidence that the lessons have been learned .
And I mean the hard lessons : not just whether we â€ “ men and women â€ “ can all stand up and say we donâ€
™ t approve of abuse , but whether men will give up some of the power that allows it to happen and to go so lightly punished .
Time and again , women tell us at Womenâ€ ™ s Aid that the man who abused them was able to play the victim , despite seriously attacking her â€ “ because sheâ€ ™ s
â€œcrazyâ€ �
; that the criminal charges were dropped ; that they were not believed ; that even if the criminal justice system took the abuse seriously , the man was able to gain revenge and ensure she was blamed through the family courts .
This is the grinding , daily reality , the huge and lethal iceberg that looms beneath the highly visible and unpunished â€ “ or inadequately punished â€ “ behaviour of high - profile abusers .
It is costing womenâ€ ™ s lives , still at the rate of two a week on average in England and Wales .
Thatâ€ ™ s why the treatment of our so - called heroes matters ."
2015-10-19,"Oscar Pistorius has been released from prison and will serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest at his uncleâ€ ™ s house , less than one year into a five - year sentence for shooting dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s family had been expecting his release on Tuesday morning , but late on Monday night his lawyer said the former Paralympian was already at his uncleâ€ ™ s house .
He is expected to remain under correctional supervision , or house arrest , until 2019 , pending the outcome of an appeal by prosecutors that could yet see him returned to jail .
The Pistorius family said in a statement read by spokesperson Anneliese Burgess on Tuesday morning that the athlete was still serving his sentence for Steenkampâ€ ™ s death .
â€œIt is very important for the family to emphasise that Oscarâ€ ™ s sentence hasnâ€ ™ t been shortened or reduced .
Heâ€
™ s simply entering the next phase of his sentence now .
He will serve this under the strict conditions that govern correctional supervision .
â€œThe family will support Oscar as he serves out the remainder of the five - year sentence handed down by the trial judge , and he will strictly adhere to the conditions set by the parole board and community corrections.â€ �
The Steenkamp familyâ€ ™ s spokesperson , Tanya Coen , said : â€œTo them it does not matter whether he was released yesterday , a few hours earlier or a few hours later , whether he remains incarcerated or not .
It makes no difference to their lives because Reeva is still not coming back.â€ �
The former athlete was convicted last year of culpable homicide after he shot dead Steenkamp at his house in Pretoria .
Pistorius maintained that he had mistaken her for an intruder , and the court accepted his argument that he had not intended to kill her .
The state has challenged Judge Thokozile Masipaâ€ ™ s original verdict of culpable homicide , and the supreme court of appeals ( SCA ) will hear that appeal on 3 November .
Prosecutors argue that Pistorius should have been convicted of murder , which carries a minimum sentence of 15 years .
Late on Monday night , Pistorius was taken from his cell to the residence of his uncle , Arnold Pistorius , in Waterkloof , an upmarket Pretoria suburb .
The house is a three - storey converted Dutch Reformed church on a luxury estate , and has a swimming pool .
External security includes four - metre high walls , surveillance cameras and a guardâ€ ™ s hut .
By midday on Tuesday there were still at least 50 journalists camped outside the property .
An enterprising Pretoria resident had set up a portable barbecue selling boerewors ( sausage ) rolls at 30 rand a piece .
But there was no sign of Pistorius .
Manelisi Wolela , a spokesperson for the department of correctional services , confirmed that he had been released at 7.30pm on Monday .
The decision to move Pistorius from the prison a day early â€ “ to avoid a media circus on Tuesday morning
â€ “ was made by the management of Kgosi Mampuru II prison , the department of correctional services said in a statement .
â€œOscar Pistorius was placed under correctional supervision tonight .
The handling of the actual placement is an operational matter of the local management , and how they handle it is their prerogative that is carried out in the best interest of all parties concerned , the victims , the offender and the department of correctional services , â€ �
it said .
Correctional services minister Michael Masutha had told local broadcaster eNCA that the terms of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s release included a requirement to meet with Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents , if and when they agree to such a meeting .
â€œIt is especially the person who is the source of your pain , who making peace with is likely to bring the greatest healing , â€ � said Masutha .
Pistorius will also have to undertake community service and attend regular psychotherapy sessions .
According to eNCA journalist Karyn Maughan , lawyers for the Steenkamp family indicated that they were willing to meet with Pistorius , but only â€œat the right timeâ€ � and away from the public eye .
In June , a parole board told Pistorius he would be released on 20 August , only for this decision to be suspended by the government following public outcry .
A judicial review panel subsequently overturned it on a technicality .
Pistorius was granted a second parole hearing last week , which set the 20 October release date .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s family had been concerned that his parole might be cut short by further legal action .
The Pistoriusâ€ ™ s
early release from prison has been criticised by womenâ€ ™ s groups in South Africa , including the ANC Womenâ€ ™ s League , who said they were â€œdisappointedâ€
� by the decision .
â€œWe pin our hopes on the SCA to repeal the judgment and that Oscar must serve a sentence that would bring him back a changed man and an advocate for womenâ€ ™ s rights in future
, â€ � it said in a statement ."
2015-10-21,"The mother of Reeva Steenkamp , who was killed by Oscar Pistorius , has said she did not want to see the disgraced athlete suffering in prison , in her first statement since he was released to house arrest on Monday .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve got no feelings of revenge .
I donâ€
™ t want to hurt him ; he is already a disabled person ,
â€ � June Steenkamp said in a televised speech at her daughterâ€ ™ s former school in Port Elizabeth .
Pistorius , who was found guilty of culpable homicide but cleared of murdering Steenkamp , will spend the remaining four years of his five - year sentence living under strict parole conditions at his uncleâ€ ™ s home in Pretoria .
â€œI
didnâ€ ™ t want him to be thrown in jail and be suffering because I donâ€ ™
t wish suffering on anyone , and thatâ€ ™ s not going to bring Reeva back , â€ � Steenkamp told the school students .
â€œBut in my heart , I donâ€ ™ t want revenge towards him .
Iâ€ ™ m past that .
Once you have told God that you forgive , you have to forgive .
And I donâ€ ™ t want him to suffer ....
I would certainly not want to hurt another human being.â€ �
She added : â€œOne has to forgive to move on , otherwise you become ill .
For God expects you to forgive , and until youâ€ ™ ve done that , you canâ€ ™ t move forward in any way.â€ �
She then read out excerpts of a speech her daughter had planned to give at a Johannesburg school that was scheduled for the day of her death .
Pistorius shot Steenkamp through a bathroom door in the early hours of 14 February 2013 when he said he mistook her for an intruder .
â€œI hope that you all had an amazing Valentineâ€ ™ s Day
and you were spoilt with love and roses and chocolates , â€ � Steenkamp said , quoting from her daughterâ€ ™ s speech .
â€œGo home and tell your parents , your siblings and your neighbours that they are appreciated and you will go to bed with a happy heart and an open mind for the future.â€ � Pistoriusâ€ ™ s parole conditions allow him to meet June Steenkamp and her husband , Barry , if they wish to do so .
Lawyers from the family have so far indicated there are no immediate plans for the family to meet Pistorius .
Prosecutors are appealing for a murder conviction at South Africaâ€ ™ s supreme court on 3 November , demanding a harsher sentence of at least 15 years .
The state will argue before five judges at the hearing that the trial judge misinterpreted parts of the law ."
2015-11-03,"Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ s defence lawyer has been inadvertently recorded telling his opposite number â€œI am going to loseâ€ � after prosecutors at an appeal hearing called for the athlete to be convicted of murder for shooting his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp .
The context of the quotes or whether Barry Roux was referring to a point of law , the appeal as a whole or an unrelated matter was not immediately clear .
The South African news site News24 said the exchange happened after the court adjourned when microphones in place for broadcasters recorded Roux telling the state prosecutor , Gerrie Nel , in Afrikaans : â€œBut that I am going to lose is a fact.â€ �
Nel told the site he could not comment on the context in which the exchange took place .
Roux has yet to speak .
Pistorius was convicted of culpable homicide last year and freed on parole to house arrest last month .
If the appeal is successful , Pistorius will probably return to prison .
Arguments at the Bloemfontein appeal court centred on whether Pistorius had the intention necessary for a murder conviction
and , if the court does find against the athlete , whether it can impose a new conviction or must order a retrial .
Neither prosecution nor defence are keen on a lengthy and expensive retrial .
Nel was highly critical of the original trial judge , Thokozile Masipa .
â€œThe court ignored the most important circumstantial evidence , â€ � he said , contending that this failure led to Masipa misconstruing Pistoriusâ€ ™ s actions on the night in question .
Nel also argued that Masipa was inconsistent in relying on Pistoriusâ€ ™ s evidence when she had already dismissed him as an unreliable witness .
Roux tried to argue that these issues were questions of fact , rather than law , and therefore not grounds for an appeal .
The judges interrupted him frequently : they were more interested in his interpretation of the concept of dolus eventualis
â€ “ in this case the argument over whether Pistorius foresaw the possibility that he might kill someone when he shot four bullets into a tiny bathroom .
â€œDid he believe he was entitled to shoot in those circumstances?â€
�
asked Justice Eric Leach repeatedly , referring to the tiny dimensions of the bathroom in which Steenkamp died .
â€œThere was no place to hide.â€ �
Roux told the court the question could not be separated from Pistoriusâ€ ™ s mental state and his physical condition as a double leg amputee .
â€œBang bang bang bang .
[ Pistorius ] fired shots in quick succession .
He should have thought better .
He should not have fired four shots .
He should not have fired shots at all .
But that does not explain what his mind is saying â€ ¦ Something must have happened in that manâ€
™ s mind that forced him to fire and explains that â€ ¦ Itâ€
™ s unfair to see this through the prism of someone standing there with two legs , â€ � he said in his closing statement .
The supreme court of appeal reserved judgment until a later date which was not specified , although it is expected to come before the court recesses on 1 December .
Legal analysts said the outcome was unpredictable .
â€œA lot of people were focussing on how gruelling the interrogation on Roux was , and drawing an inference from that .
But having one or two vocal judges doesnâ€ ™ t give you an indication into what the other three are thinking , â€ � said Kelly Phelps , law professor at the University of Cape Town .
â€œSimply because they argue vociferously with one side ,
doesnâ€ ™ t mean they necessarily agree or disagree with that side .
We canâ€
™ t know where this stands right now.â€
�
Pistorius did not attend the appeal ; June Steenkamp , Reevaâ€ ™ s mother , was in the public gallery .
Hagen Engler , a close friend of Reevaâ€ ™ s , told the Guardian : â€œI believe in the SA justice system , overloaded and challenged as it is .
So I have faith that judge Masipa applied her mind and reached the decision she felt was best .
But however long Oscar serves doesnâ€ ™ t at all compensate for the loss of Reeva .
Nothing really could.â€ �"
2015-11-03,"The stateâ€ ™ s case
South Africaâ€ ™ s
supreme court of appeal has heard arguments from state prosecutors that the judge in Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ s original trial , Thokozile Masipa , was wrong when she found him not guilty of the murder of Reeva Steenkamp .
The chief prosecutor , Gerrie Nel , told the panel of five judges that Masipa had erred in her application of the legal principle of dolus eventualis , and that she was wrong to conclude that Pistorius had not foreseen that firing four shots into a door was likely to kill or injure the person behind it .
Masipa further erred in her exclusion of dolus eventualis because she accepted that Pistorius believed Steenkamp was in bed , Nel argued .
He said it meant there was criminal intent to bring about the demise of whoever was inside the toilet cubicle .
On this point , at least one judge openly agreed .
The state also alleges that Masipa was wrong to dismiss circumstantial evidence that it said proved the accusedâ€ ™ s version of events to be impossible .
Nel argued that the supreme court was entitled to overturn the high court ruling , because finding Pistorius guilty of culpable homicide was a de facto acquittal on the murder charge .
Neither the state nor the defence has the stomach for a retrial , Nel said , as he asked the court to instead impose its own verdict of murder : He had defences that exclude each other â€ ¦ The one he elected to use , the court rejected that one and gave him another one .
The court should have rejected his evidence as impossible â€ ¦
On the objective facts , the accused can not escape a verdict of murder .
The defence case Barry Roux , representing Pistorius , said the stateâ€ ™ s case rested on issues of fact rather than points of law , and was therefore not a matter for the supreme court .
He faced questioning from the judges , however , over Pistoriusâ€ ™ s intentions when firing into the tiny cubicle .
Judge Leach told him : There was no place to hide in there â€ ¦ If you put four shots through that door you must surely see you will shoot someone .
Roux maintained that Masipa had been correct to apply the principle of dolus eventualis to the question of whether Steenkamp was in the cubicle , given she had already accepted that Pistorius genuinely believed there was an intruder in the bathroom , and that his girlfriend was still in bed : Why would he just want to murder someone in the toilet , knowing sheâ€ ™ s in the bedroom ?
The defence insists that Pistorius was scared , vulnerable and on his stumps , and that his state of mind at the time of firing rules out a murder verdict .
What happens next ?
The supreme court of appeal has reserved its judgment , and it has not given a date for it to be revealed .
The ruling will be based on a majority decision among the five judges , several of whom argued on Tuesday that the bench was indeed entitled to impose its own verdict rather than simply ordering a retrial if it accepts the stateâ€ ™ s case .
The judges could reject the stateâ€ ™ s appeal , order a retrial - although neither side showed any appetite for that on Tuesday - or substitute a new verdict .
If the appeal court decides to impose a guilty verdict on the murder charge , the case would return to the high court for fresh sentencing .
Pistorius remains under house arrest at his uncleâ€ ™ s house in Pretoria ."

Roux maintained that the trial judge was correct to apply the principle of dolus eventualis to the question of whether Steenkamp was in the cubicle , given that the judge had already accepted that Pistorius genuinely believed there was an intruder in the bathroom , and that his girlfriend was still in bed : Why would he just want to murder someone in the toilet , knowing sheâ€ ™ s in the bedroom ?
The defence insists that Pistorius was scared , vulnerable and on his stumps ; his state of mind rules out murder .
What happens next ?
The appeal court has reserved its judgment ; it has not given a date for this to be revealed .
The ruling will rely on a majority decision among the five judges , several of whom argued today that the bench was indeed entitled to impose its own verdict ( rather than simply order a retrial ) should it accept the stateâ€ ™ s argument .
The judges could reject the stateâ€ ™ s appeal , order a retrial ( although there was no appetite for that expressed by any side today ) , or substitute a new verdict .
If the appeal court decides to impose a guilty verdict on the murder charge , the case would return to the high court for a fresh sentence .
Oscar Pistorius remains under house arrest at his uncleâ€ ™ s house in Pretoria .
Given the judgesâ€ ™ stern questioning of both parties , it is hard to draw a conclusion about who will be feeling most optimistic after todayâ€ ™ s hearing .
But many in Bloemfontein report that the state â€ “ and the Steenkamp family and supporters â€ “ appear upbeat : The arguments are over and court is adjourned .
Judgment is reserved but no date given .
I will post a summary of the hearingâ€ ™ s key developments shortly .
Leach asks if Masipaâ€ ™ s finding that Pistorius believed there was an intruder binds the current court .
The finding was wrongly made , Nel says .
Was there a genuine threat , and what was the alternative action , Nel says .
The trial court did not ask or answer these questions .
The judges have further questions for Gerrie Nel .
Why did Pistorius fire , Nel is asked .
Nel says we donâ€ ™ t need to know why he shot .
The point is that he did shoot .
Pistorius was â€œscared , really scaredâ€ � , says Roux .
Why would he have fired the shots ?
There is no reason unless he is genuinely afraid for his life .
And thatâ€ ™ s it from Roux .
He sits down .
Roux swings the focus on to Pistoriusâ€ ™ personality .
He wants to talk about the â€œtwo Oscarsâ€ � â€ “ one the famous athlete , the other an anxious , vulnerable person .
The defence previously told the high court that a report by a clinical psychologist , following a 30-day mental health evaluation ordered by the court , described a split in his personality â€ ¦ the one a vulnerable , scared disabled person ; the other a strong physical person achieving beyond expectation and finding reward for it both intra - physically and interpersonally .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ state of mind is key , Roux says .
He should not have fired four shots .
He should not have fired shots at all .
But case law tells us we can not isolate the actions from who the person is , Roux adds .
Majiedt says the court has heard all the evidence .
If it finds for the state , why would it be in anyoneâ€
™ s interest â€ “ including the accused â€ “ to have a retrial ?
Why shouldnâ€ ™ t this court substitute its own verdict ?
Now Judge Mhlantla weighs in with more legal precedent on when and why the appeal court can substitute its own verdict .
Leach too .
Roux is being pressed very hard .
Judge Majiedt asks Roux why the defence submits that â€ “ if the appeal court finds the law was misapplied â€ “ this court can not substitute its own verdict : Why â€ ¦ in the interest of justice can this court not give the judgment that ought to have been given ?
The defence argument is that there would need to be a retrial , Roux says .
Majiedt says a retrial is not an ideal option , â€œgiven all that has gone beforeâ€ � .
He doesnâ€ ™ t clarify â€ “ heâ€
™ s perhaps referring to the televising of the original trial ?
Itâ€ ™ s unclear .
But the judge says he does not understand Rouxâ€ ™ s argument that this court could not reach its own verdict .
Roux says he would like to move on to his next point .
But Judge Leach would like to ask him another question , about Seekoei ( I covered this earlier ; it covers the stateâ€ ™ s right to appeal to the supreme court ) .
Roux says itâ€ ™ s not part of the defence case ; there was general agreement earlier that it is no longer a useful law .
But he does dangle the question of double jeopardy â€ “ is this appeal giving the state a second chance after it failed to get the verdict it wanted ?
This is a compelling battle between Roux and Leach â€ “ the judge pushes Roux to concede that Masipaâ€ ™ s findings on the identity issue were wrong .
Roux will not .
Once you accept that factual finding , Roux says , you can not find Pistorius guilty of murder .
( His problem is that at least one of these judges does not appear to accept that this was a factual finding .
The appeal court ruling relies on a majority decision among the five judges . )
Roux says Masipa determined that Pistorius was wrong â€ “ this is why she found him guilty of culpable homicide .
But Masipa did accept that he genuinely thought he was in danger and that he believed Steenkamp was in the bedroom .
That is a factual finding , Roux argues .
And given that : Why would he just want to murder someone in the toilet , knowing sheâ€ ™ s in the bedroom ?
In that context , Masipaâ€ ™ s finding on dolus eventualis was correct , Roux argues .
This helpful extract by reporter Nastasya Tay from Judge Masipaâ€ ™ s judgment shows its focus on the identity of Steenkamp .
At least one of the judges on the bench today seem to be arguing that this was wrong â€ “ that dolus eventualis can apply regardless of the identity of the deceased .
Roux finds a reference in his notes .
Leach says it does not support the defence argument that Masipa made a factual finding that Pistorius genuinely believed there was an intruder .
He didnâ€
™ t know if it was a 12-year - old child or a man with a submachine gun , Leach says .
The fact that Pistorius was wrong is something else , says Roux .
Did he believe that he was entitled to shoot in those circumstances , Leach asks .
He thought his life was in danger , Roux insists .
He was vulnerable and on his stumps .
Roux insists there was a factual finding by the trial court that Pistorius genuinely believed his life was in danger .
Show me , says Judge Leach .
Leach says the trial judge found Pistorius to be a â€œshockingâ€ � and â€œunreliableâ€ � witness , but then went on to accept his claim that he honestly believed his life was in danger , without evidence to support it .
He was armed with a firearm and went to confront the noise , Leach adds .
Roux asks , do we think he is lying ?
Roux says it makes sense to him that Masipa ruled she could not find dolus eventualis because Pistorius genuinely thought it was an intruder in the cubicle .
But why does the identity matter , the bench wants to know : did Pistorius think he was entitled to shoot at whoever was behind the door ?
Identity doesnâ€ ™ t come into it , says Roux , because it never entered Pistoriusâ€ ™ mind that the person behind the door was Steenkamp .
Roux is very animated ; he is being pushed hard by the judges now .
Roux comes back .
Pistorius believed his life was in danger , he says .
He thought he was firing shots at an intruder .
He says the judgeâ€ ™ s comments on dolus eventualis relate to whether the accused foresaw that it could have been Steenkamp in the cubicle .
He did not , Roux says .
Leach : When he fired the bullets did he know there was a person behind the door ?
The issue is whether Pistorius foresaw the consequences , Leach goes on .
Masipaâ€ ™ s ruling was that he did not because he did not know that it was Steenkamp .
His view is that this intepretation is legally wrong .
Leach is still not happy .
Masipa defined dolus eventualis correctly , he repeats , but she then failed to apply it to anything other than Steenkamp being behind the door .
Her analysis of dolus eventualis , it seems to me , was wrong â€ ¦
The issue was he knew a person was in the cubicle .
Thatâ€ ™ s not really the issue , Roux interjects .
Leach comes back :
Of course itâ€ ™ s the issue .
Roux finds his feet again : the court found that Pistorius genuinely believed he was in danger and that Steenkamp was in the bedroom .
That canâ€ ™ t be ignored , he says .
Leach is now reading from Masipaâ€ ™ s judgment about the shooting .
Is that not an incorrect application of the law regarding dolus eventualis , Leach asks Roux .
Leach goes on :
Masipaâ€ ™ s application of dolus eventualis applies only to whether Steenkamp ( the judge calls her â€œReevaâ€ � ) was the person inside the cubicle .
Isnâ€ ™ t that a wrong interpretation of the law , he says .
Roux seems rather flustered .
He canâ€ ™ t find the right page in his notes , he says .
But he says he does not agree .
Judge Leach is coming back at Roux with a sheaf of papers of his own .
If a trial judge fails to apply herself to all the evidence , that is a misapplication of law , Leach tells Roux .
Doesnâ€ ™ t that give you considerable difficulty , he asks the defence .
Roux continues with his line that the court can not consider the stateâ€ ™ s appeal if it relies on points of fact , rather than points of law .
A personâ€ ™ s intention is a question of fact , he says .
My colleague Simon Allison reports from the court room in Bloemfontein : Gerrie Nel looked grateful to take his seat after an exhausting opening submission .
It must be daunting for any lawyer , no matter how experienced , to argue in front of five of South Africaâ€ ™ s finest legal minds , all of whom are working their hardest to pick holes in your argument .
Nel looked flustered at times , especially as he scratched around for case law to further his position , and the constant interruptions from the bench didnâ€ ™ t allow him to build his case as smoothly as he would have liked .
Itâ€ ™ s important not to read too much into the judgesâ€ ™ s questions or their general demeanour , however â€ “
the combative approach is designed to put legal teams under pressure , and in this case the burden of proof lies with the prosecution .
We take a short break .
Roux still has more to say , but will have to wait while the judges adjourn for 15 minutes .
Judge Baartman pushes Roux on why four shots were necessary ; Roux concedes that injury or death was a â€œpossible
consquenceâ€ � .
Judge Majiedt wonders why Roux has not dealt with the evidence of Captain Christian Mangena , a police ballistics expert who testified that Steenkamp was standing close behind the door when she was shot .
Majiedt says the firing of the four bullets were aimed in a direction that could only have caused great damage .
Judge Leach points out that the â€œvery restrictedâ€ � size of the cubicle meant there was little chance of survival for anyone inside it : There was no place to hide in there â€
¦
If you put four shots through that door you must surely see you will shoot someone .
Reeva Steenkamp had â€œnowhere to hideâ€ � , he says .
Roux :
The state needed to find , or to construct , questions of law from factual findings .
His argument here is that the court is not entitled to overturn the original verdict .
The screams have no relevance to dolus eventualis , Roux says â€ “
they are relevant only if the state argues that Steenkamp was running away from Pistorius during an argument .
But the state is no longer pursuing that argument .
Another question from the bench : this time clarifying that Steenkamp had locked herself inside the toilet cubicle , and had her phone with her .
Roux says he would have locked the door if he had heard someone scream ( as Pistorius said he did , telling the supposed intruder to get out of his house ) .
Roux is now reciting Masipaâ€ ™ s comments on the evidence that Nel says she ignored .
The judge was not persuaded by the stateâ€ ™ s evidence , he says .
Roux :
It was not possible for the deceased to have screamed after the shots .
The high court was right to dismiss evidence about the screaming , he says .
Testimony that a woman was screaming was incorrect and the judge was right to find it unreliable .
Here is the thrust of Rouxâ€ ™ s argument
â€ “ the questions posed by the state are not questions of law , and so can not be considered by this court .
He says Masipa did not ignore the circumstantial evidence , as Nel alleges .
This was dealt with in her ruling , Roux says , â€œevery
aspectâ€ � .
Lead counsel for Pistorius , Barry Roux , takes his turn now .
That is the conclusion of the stateâ€ ™ s submission .
Nel sits down .
Nel now says his submission is complete .
But the judges have questions .
Isnâ€
™ t his argument for dolus eventualis an issue of fact , not of law , given that the principle of dolus eventualis is inferred from facts ?
Nel disagrees : the misapplication of the principle is an issue of law .
The court correctly defined dolus eventualis , he says ; but it applied it incorrectly .
The court said on two occasions that Pistorius could not have foreseen that he would shoot Steenkamp because he thought she was in the bedroom .
Judge Leach says this is a misapplication of dolus eventualis
â€ “ the issue of whether it was Steenkamp in the cubicle is wrong .
Nel says neither state nor defence would be â€œkeen for a retrialâ€ � .
Neither of us have the stomach for it , he adds , gesturing to Roux .
But if thatâ€ ™ s the only way of correcting an error , thatâ€ ™ s what we will have to do , he adds .
His preference would be for this court to substitute a conviction of murder .
June Steenkamp , the mother of Reeva Steenkamp , is listening to proceedings .
She earlier told reporters that she was here to support Nel .
Nel and the judges agree that even if the supreme court decides that Pistorius ought to be convicted of murder , the case would need to be referred back to the high court â€ “ and to Masipa â€ “ for sentence .
Judge Mpati asks whether it matters who â€ “ Reeva Steenkamp or an intruder â€ “ was behind the closed cubicle door .
For the purposes of the appeal , it does not , says Nel .
There was a criminal intent to bring about the demise of whoever was inside the toilet cubicle .
Judge Baartman asks if this is because of the number of shots fired ( four ) ?
Nel agrees .
Nel is not arguing for dolus directus ( premeditated murder ) , he insists , when pressed by one of the judges .
He wants a finding of dolus eventualis ( more on what that means here ) .
On to the screams heard by various neighbours of Pistorius before and after the gunshots .
Nel says he wonâ€ ™ t talk about these because the judge made a ruling on these that they were not credible , and
so he canâ€
™ t go over that in this court .
The supreme court judges , however , are quite keen to talk about the screams .
Nel confirms : yes , it was Pistoriusâ€ ™ contention that any screams heard before the gunshots came from him .
Nel is now talking about evidence relating to when Reeva Steenkamp last ate and the contents of her stomach .
The original trial heard a lot of evidence about this , and the forensics of gastric emptying .
Judge Masipa dismissed it in her ruling as too disputed and not relevant to her verdict .
Nel :
On the objective facts , the accused can not escape a verdict of murder .
The panel of judges are interrogating Nel quite intensely â€ “ rather different to Judge Masipaâ€ ™ s less frequent , but pointed , interruptions during the trial .
Judge Mhlantla says that Pistorius could not claim a lack of intention to kill , but also rely on self - defence to justify the shooting .
Nel enthusiastically agrees â€ “ this was a favourite theme of his during the trial , during which he often referred to the accusedâ€ ™ s â€œplethora of defencesâ€
�
: He had defences that exclude each other â€ ¦ The one he elected to use , the court rejected that one and gave him another one .
The court should have rejected his evidence as impossible .
The court accepted that Pistorius was a bad witness , Nel points out , but yet accepted his version of events .
Nel :
The court erred â€ ¦ to understand how to apply circumstantial evidence .
If the court did not apply the principles surrounding circumstantial evidence , and ignored evidence , thatâ€ ™ s a legal question .
He says Masipa was wrong to dismiss evidence about the condition of the bedroom : the fan , the duvet and the denim .
( The positions of these items , and what they suggested about the movements of Pistorius and Steenkamp on the night of the shooting , were pored over during the trial , but given little credence by Masipa in her ruling . )
Nel says this evidence shows the version given by Pistorius could not be true .
Nel says the court ignored circumstantial evidence ; â€œit never became
clearâ€ � what attention the judge had paid to it .
Nel moves on to his second point .
The original judge was wrong to throw out circumstantial evidence , he argues , by looking at it piece - by - piece , rather than as a â€œmosaicâ€ � .
Judge Masipa paid only â€œlip
serviceâ€
� to such evidence , he says .
( The defence is expected to argue against Nelâ€ ™ s interpretation .
It will likely say that the state offered the judge two options on which to convict Pistorius : murder or culpable homicide . )
Nel and the judges are discussing the Seekoei case , a principle that could determine whether or not the supreme court is able to overturn the culpable homicide verdict : Judge Majiedt says Seekoei is no longer good law ; things have moved on .
Nel agrees .
It is not applicable any more , he says , and so this court should make a ruling in this appeal .
Justice Mpati asks if Nel would have been satisfied if the high court had simply ruled that the murder charge was not proved .
No , says Nel : the effect is the same â€ “ it is an acquittal on the charge of murder .
In order to ascertain that the supreme court is entitled to hear this appeal , Nel must establish that Pistorius was in fact acquitted of murder .
His conviction on an alternative count â€ “ of culpable homicide â€ “ seems to have made this a grey area .
Nel says the state was not happy with the factual findings of the high court , but he will not attack those .
He will focus on what he says were the errors in law made by the original judge .
There have already been several interjections from the bench ; the judges have a lot of questions about Nelâ€ ™ s intentions here .
Nel dives straight into case law .
He says the key element here is whether the law was correctly applied .
There are two hurdles , he says : to convince the court that it is entitled to consider the case although the trial did not end in a complete acquittal ; and to establish that there were errors in law .
Gerrie Nel is first up to address the judges .
The original trial catapulted what might once have been an obscure legal principle into the global spotlight .
Today it will be central to the stateâ€ ™ s case that Judge Masipa got it wrong when she found Pistorius not guilty of murder .
But what does it mean ?
A simple explanation is that it hinges on whether an accused did foresee the outcome of his actions , rather than whether they should have .
In this case , Masipa accepted Pistoriusâ€ ™ argument that he did not think his actions would lead to the death of the person behind the door .
But in deciding that a reasonable person should have foreseen that , she did find him guilty of culpable homicide .
South African barrister Ulrich Roux argued after the verdict that the principle of dolus eventualis should have resulted in a murder conviction for Pistorius :
According to the law , someone is guilty of murder if they know that their actions could lead to the killing of a person and reconcile themselves to that fact , and act anyway .
In delivering her ruling , judge Thokozile Masipa said that â€œa reasonable person would have foreseen if he fired shots at the door , the person inside the toilet might be struck and might die as a resultâ€ � , which suggests a classic case of dolus eventualis .
But the judge seems to have cleared him of this charge because she felt that , to be guilty of common - law murder , Pistorius needed to have foreseen that his actions would kill a specific person
â€ “ Reeva Steenkamp â€
¦ I would say that the law is clear
â€ “
it doesnâ€ ™ t have to be a specific person whose death can be foreseen , it can be anyone .
With the court due to convene at 10 am local time â€ “ in around 15 minutesâ€ ™ time â€ “ most parties , bar the judges , are now in place in the court room .
Gerrie Nel , for the state , and Barry Roux , for Pistorius , are here , as is June Steenkamp , the mother of Reeva Steenkamp .
Oscar Pistorius will not be in court today .
He remains under house arrest at his uncleâ€ ™ s house in Pretoria .
My colleague Simon Allison sends this dispatch from the supreme court : Itâ€ ™ s a bright sunny day in Bloemfontein , although unseasonably cold .
The crowds that attended the first trial are absent
( journalists aside : there are plenty of us here , as the case continues to fascinate global audiences ) .
A small band of ANC Youth League members â€ “ perhaps a dozen of them â€ “ have arrived to show their support for Reeva Steenkamp , dressed in bright green and yellow outfits and singing struggle songs .
That the court is in Bloemfontein at all is a quirk of South Africaâ€ ™ s unusual history .
To my knowledge , South Africa is the only country in the world to boast three official capital cities : Pretoria for the executive , Cape Town for the legislature , and Bloemfontein for the judiciary .
But while Pretoria and Cape Town have remained relevant , Bloemfontein is far down the countryâ€ ™ s
urban pecking order â€ “ perhaps a reflection of the relative significance of the judiciary as compared to the other branches of government ?
For a recap of the original trial , this article takes you through the key points of each day in court :
Although Pistorius will not be present at the court today , June Steenkamp , the mother of Reeva Steenkamp , will attend .
Steenkamp recently said of her daughterâ€ ™ s killer : I didnâ€ ™ t want him to be thrown in jail and be suffering because I donâ€ ™
t wish suffering on anyone , and thatâ€ ™ s not going to bring Reeva back .
But in my heart , I donâ€ ™ t want revenge towards him .
Iâ€ ™ m past that .
Once you have told God that you forgive , you have to forgive .
And I donâ€ ™ t want him to suffer â€
¦ I would certainly not want to hurt another human being .
Five judges of the supreme court will hear the appeal : Judge president Lex Mpati heads the bench ; Judge Nonkosi Mhlantla Judge Eric Leach Judge Steven Majiedt Acting judge Elizabeth Baartman
The judges have already had some time to consider the arguments from both legal teams .
The state submitted its heads of argument ( its written case ) to the court in August ; Pistoriusâ€ ™ lawyers handed in theirs in September .
Today will see the two legal protagonists from the original trial â€ “ chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel and Barry Roux for the defence â€ “ argue their cases in person in front of the judges .
Key to todayâ€ ™ s hearing is that the state must argue not on points of fact , but on points of law â€ “ that the high court in its original verdict misapplied or misinterpreted legal principles .
No new evidence is allowed to be presented , and no witnesses will be called .
The state will say that Judge Masipa misapplied the legal principle of dolus eventualis
â€ “ prosecutors will argue that Pistorius foresaw that his actions in firing four shots into the door could have led to the death of the person behind it , but went ahead anyway .
Masipa in the original trial accepted Pistoriusâ€ ™ claim that he had not foreseen such an outcome .
The prosecution argues : Should it be found that the court incorrectly applied the principles of dolus eventualis , then a conclusion that the respondent should have been convicted of murder is , with respect , inescapable â€ ¦
We argue that the only conceivable finding based on the facts could at a minimum be that , in arming himself , walking to the bathroom with the intention to shoot , whilst knowing that there is a person behind a closed door of a small cubicle and intentionally firing four shots , should be that he intended to kill the person in the cubicle â€ ¦
It is respectfully submitted that an accusedâ€ ™ s version must be regarded as â€˜inherently improbabl[e]â€ ™ if â€˜he presents conflicting versions to the courtâ€ ™ , so much so that it can not be reasonably possibly true .
The defence will argue that Masipa correctly applied the law , and that the state failed in the original trial to prove that Pistorius intended to kill .
South Africaâ€ ™ s supreme court today convenes to hear prosecutors argue that Oscar Pistorius should have been found guilty of murder for shooting his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , in February 2013 .
At the culmination of a months - long trial last year , high court judge Thokozile Masipa ruled that while the athlete had acted unlawfully in firing four bullets through a locked toilet door at his home in Pretoria , he had not intended to kill the person behind it .
Pistorius maintained that he thought he was firing at an intruder .
Masipa found him guilty of culpable homicide â€ “ equivalent to manslaughter â€ “ and sentenced him to five years .
He was released from Kgosi Mampuru II prison last month , after one year behind bars , to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest at his uncleâ€ ™ s home .
Today prosecutors will argue before a panel of judges that Masipaâ€ ™ s decision was wrong and that Pistorius should have been convicted of murder .
If the supreme court agrees , it can impose a murder conviction , which could see Pistorius returned to jail for up to 15 years .
Alternatively , the judges could order a retrial , or dismiss the stateâ€ ™ s argument .
Lawyers for Pistorius will argue that the original conviction should stand .
Tuesday will see both sides make their case to the judges .
Each has submitted their heads of argument to the court ; you can read the stateâ€ ™ s submission here .
Pistorius will not attend the hearing , and the judges are expected to reserve their ruling to a later date .
This rolling blog will cover the hearing live as court convenes at 10 am local time ( 8 am GMT/7pm AEDT ) .
My colleague Simon Allison will be in court in Bloemfontein ; you can follow his updates on this live blog and @simonallison .
I will also tweet key developments @Claire_Phipps .

2015-12-03,"What happened in court ?
Oscar Pistorius has been found guilty of the murder of Reeva Steenkamp , in a supreme court ruling that overturned a culpable homicide conviction .
Justice Eric Leach , reading the ruling on behalf of a five - judge bench unanimous in its verdict , said : As a result of the errors of law â€ ¦ and on a proper appraisal of the facts , [ Pistorius ] ought to have been convicted not of culpable homicide on that count but of murder .
In the interests of justice the conviction and the sentence imposed in respect thereof must be set aside and the conviction substituted with a conviction of the correct offence .
How did the judges reach their decision ?
The issue before the court was whether in shooting Steenkamp Pistorius committed the crime of murder , defined as the intentional killing of a human being , or the lesser offence of culpable homicide , defined as the negligent killing of another .
The judges said Pistoriusâ€ ™ s evidence and explanations for killing Steenkamp were implausible and that he had never offered an acceptable explanation for firing four times through a closed door .
They said Pistoriusâ€ ™ s claim â€ “ one of several put forward by the defence â€ “ of putative private defence , or self - defence in fear of his life , was not rational .
His evidence was so contradictory that it was impossible to know his true reason for firing , but it was clear that the person behind the door did not pose any immediate threat to him .
What was the stateâ€ ™ s case ?
State prosecutors , speaking at an appeal hearing in November , argued that trial judge , Thokozile Masipa , was wrong when she found Pistorius not guilty of murder .
Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel told the panel of five judges that Masipa had erred in her application of the legal principle of dolus eventualis , and that she was wrong to conclude that Pistorius had not foreseen that firing four shots into a locked door was likely to kill or injure the person behind it .
Even if Pistorius believed Steenkamp was in bed , there was a criminal intent to bring about the demise of whoever was inside the toilet cubicle , Nel argued .
The state further alleged that the trial judge was wrong to dismiss circumstantial evidence that it said proved the accusedâ€ ™ s version of events to be impossible .
What is dolus eventualis ?
Dolus eventualis hinges on whether an accused did foresee the outcome of his actions , rather than whether they should have .
In this case , Masipa originally accepted Pistoriusâ€ ™ s argument that he did not think his actions would lead to the death of the person behind the door .
But she found him guilty of culpable homicide after deciding that a reasonable person should have foreseen such an outcome .
The appeal court judges said Masipa made an error when reaching this verdict .
They said the judge was wrong in her application of dolus eventualis , as Pistorius â€œmust have foreseenâ€ � that firing into the door could cause the death of whoever was behind it .
Masipa also wrongly conflated the test of dolus eventualis with dolus directus in accepting the defence argument that because Pistorius did not know the person behind the door was Steenkamp meant he could not be guilty of murder .
While Masipaâ€ ™ s verdict was premised upon an acceptance that Pistorius did not think Steenkamp was in the toilet , the judges said the key thing is that the perpetrator knows his actions could kill that person , regardless of who it is .
The failure to take into account all the evidence â€ “ in particular key ballistics evidence â€ “ amounted to a failure in law , the judges said .
Can the defence appeal ?
South African legal experts say it is possible that Pistorius could appeal to the constitutional court , but this is a rare step .
The key to such an appeal would be for the defence to argue that Pistorius did not receive a fair trial .
The defence will also be able to make a fresh argument in mitigation of sentence when Pistorius returns to the Pretoria high court , probably next year .
The result of that new sentencing could determine whether or not the defence attempts an appeal , according to South African attorney David Dadic .
What happens next for Pistorius ?
The South African National Prosecuting Authority has reportedly said that Pistorius will remain under correctional supervision â€ “ that is under house arrest at his uncleâ€ ™ s home â€ “ until he appears for re - sentencing in front of Masipa .
No date has been set for that hearing .
This means Pistorius will not be returning to prison immediately .
A minimum murder sentence in South Africa is 15 years , but judges can apply some discretion .
In his ruling , Leach said the court sentencing Pistorius will have to take account the five years imprisonment he was previously handed , as well as the fact that heâ€ ™ s already served one year .
What have relatives of Pistorius and Steenkamp said about the latest verdict ?
Steenkampâ€ ™ s father , Barry , told local television station ANN7 :
â€œItâ€ ™ s a big relief .
I feel itâ€ ™ s a fair decision that the judge gave , â€ � before breaking down in tears .
The Pistorius family put out this statement : We have taken note of the judgment that has just been handed down by the supreme court of appeal .
The legal team will study the finding and we will be guided by them in terms of options going forward .
We will not be commenting any further at this stage .
What does the ruling mean for the original judge ?
While the appeal court ruled that Masipa had made several errors of law , it also commended her role in the trial .
Leach said : Before closing , it is necessary to make a final comment .
The trial was conducted in the glare of international attention and the focus of television cameras , which must have added to the inherently heavy rigours that are brought to bear upon trial courts in conducting lengthy and complicated trials .
The trial judge conducted the hearing with a degree of dignity and patience that is a credit to the judiciary .
The fact that this court has determined that certain mistakes were made should not be seen as an adverse comment upon her competence and ability .
The fact is that different judges reach different conclusions and , in the light of an appeal structure , those of the appellate court prevail .
But the fact that the appeal has succeeded is not to be regarded as a slight upon the trial judge who is to be congratulated for the manner in which she conducted the proceedings .
You can read the full ruling here ."
2015-12-03,"South Africaâ€ ™ s supreme court of appeal has found Oscar Pistorius guilty of murdering his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , overturning a previous conviction for culpable homicide .
The court has ordered the original trial judge in Pretoria to impose a harsher sentence .
No date has been set for this hearing .
The minimum sentence for murder is 15 years in prison .
Pistorius is currently living under house arrest at his uncleâ€ ™ s home in Pretoria , having been freed from prison after serving less than a year behind bars .
He will reportedly be allowed to remain in correctional supervision until a new sentence is handed down .
Pistorius shot and killed Steenkamp on Valentineâ€ ™ s Day in 2013 , and later said he thought she was an intruder .
Justice Eric Leach , who read out an abridged version of the judgment on Thursday morning on behalf of the court , said : â€œThe accused ought to have been found guilty of murder.â€ �
He described Steenkampâ€ ™ s death as â€œa tragedy of Shakespearean proportionsâ€ � .
As is custom , Pistorius and his family were not in the court in Bloemfontein as the judgment was delivered .
June Steenkamp , Reevaâ€ ™ s mother , was seen sobbing on the stairs of the court in Bloemfontein after the judgment was read out .
Her father , Barry , speaking from Port Elizabeth , said his family could finally get on with their lives .
Pistorius was released into house arrest in October having served one - fifth of his original five - year term , and has been performing court - mandated community service .
The appeal centred on the legal concept of dolus eventualis , or indirect intention â€ “ in laymanâ€ ™ s terms , the question of whether Pistorius had foreseen the possibility that he might kill somebody when he fired four shots into the bathroom door .
The appeal court ruled ( pdf ) that the trial judge , Thokozile Masipa , had applied this concept incorrectly , saying her ruling was â€œconfusing in various respectsâ€ � .
Leach said Pistorius did have the requisite legal intention to be found guilty of murder .
â€œIn these circumstances , I have no doubt that in firing the fatal shots the accused must have foreseen that whoever was behind the toilet door might die , but reconciled with that event occurring , and gambled with that personâ€ ™ s life , â€ � he said .
Leach was critical of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s inconsistent testimony in the original trial .
â€œIn the light of these contradictions [ in Pistoriusâ€ ™ testimony ]
, one does not really know what his explanation is for having fired the fatal shots , â€ �
he said .
The Pistorius family issued a brief statement saying : â€œWe have taken note of the judgment that has just been handed down by the supreme court of appeal .
The legal team will study the finding and we will be guided by them in terms of options going forward .
We will not be commenting any further at this stage.â€
�
The African National Congress Womenâ€ ™ s League , vocal critics of Masipaâ€ ™ s judgment , welcomed the new conviction .
â€œWe are happy with what the judges decided today , â€ � said the Free State chair Mapaseka Nkoane .
â€œWe want to say to men out there
â€
“ let the killings of women stop.â€ �"
2015-12-03,"Oscar Pistorius has been found guilty of the murder of Reeva Steenkamp , in an appeal court ruling that set aside his original conviction for culpable homicide :
As a result of the errors of law â€ ¦ and on a proper appraisal of the facts , he ought to have been convicted not of culpable homicide on that count but of murder .
In the interests of justice the conviction and the sentence imposed in respect thereof must be set aside and the conviction substituted with a conviction of the correct offence .
The five judges , who were unanimous in their verdict , said Pistoriusâ€ ™ evidence and explanations for killing Steenkamp were â€œimplausibleâ€
�
and he had â€œnever offered an acceptable explanationâ€ � for firing four times through a closed door .
The appeal court said the original trial judge , Thokozile Masipa , had been wrong on several points of law , chief among them her conclusion that Pistorius had not foreseen that his actions could kill somebody ( dolus eventualis ) .
Justice Eric Leach , reading the ruling on behalf of the bench , said : I have no doubt â€ ¦ the accused must have foreseen and therefore did foresee that whoever was behind that door might die .
The judges said it was clear that Pistorius had criminal intent in firing , and was therefore guilty of murder by dolus eventualis ( see here for what that means ) .
Pistorius , who was not at the supreme court in Bloemfontein to hear the ruling , will have to appear at the high court in Pretoria for fresh sentencing by Masipa .
Until then , he is likely to stay under house arrest at his uncleâ€ ™ s home and will not immediately return to prison .

Iâ€ ™ m wrapping up this live blog now .
Thank you for reading and for your comments .
We will have live coverage again when Pistorius returns to the high court for his fresh sentencing .
The appeal court , despite having ruled that Judge Thokozile Masipa , who presided over the original trial , had made several errors of law , nonetheless commended her role : Before closing , it is necessary to make a final comment .
The trial was conducted in the glare of international attention and the focus of television cameras , which must have added to the inherently heavy rigours that are brought to bear upon trial courts in conducting lengthy and complicated trials .
The trial judge conducted the hearing with a degree of dignity and patience that is a credit to the judiciary .
The fact that this court has determined that certain mistakes were made should not be seen as an adverse comment upon her competence and ability .
The fact is that different judges reach different conclusions and , in the light of an appeal structure , those of the appellate court prevail .
But the fact that the appeal has succeeded is not to be regarded as a slight upon the trial judge who is to be congratulated for the manner in which she conducted the proceedings .
Here is the link to the full appeal court judgment ( pdf ) .
The Pistorius family has put out this statement : We have taken note of the judgment that has just been handed down by the supreme court of appeal .
The legal team will study the finding and we will be guided by them in terms of options going forward .
We will not be commenting any further at this stage .
This was a crucial part of the appeal court ruling , in answer to the argument that the ordeal of the trial , the original culpable homicide verdict , and the serving of prison time meant that a murder conviction was theoretical or unnecessary : The interests of justice require that persons should be convicted of the actual crimes they have committed , and not of lesser offences .
That is particularly so in crimes of violence .
It would be wrong to effectively think away the fact that an accused person is guilty of murder if he ought to have been convicted of that offence .
Could the defence appeal against the overturning of the culpable homicide verdict and the imposition of a murder conviction ?
South African legal experts say it is possible that Pistorius could appeal to the constitutional court , but this is a rare step .
The key to such an appeal would be for the defence to argue that Pistorius did not receive a fair trial .
The defence will also get the opportunity to make a fresh argument in mitigation of sentence when Pistorius returns to stand in front of Judge Masipa in the Pretoria high court , probably next year .
The result of that new sentencing could determine whether or not the defence attempts an appeal , believes South African attorney David Dadic :
The South African National Prosecuting Authority has reportedly said that Pistorius will remain under correctional supervision â€ “ that is , under house arrest at his uncleâ€ ™ s home â€ “ until he appears for re - sentencing before the high court in Pretoria .
No date has been set for that hearing .
This means Oscar Pistorius will not be returning immediately to prison .
Reporters have now been given paper copies of the full appeal court ruling .
It doesnâ€ ™ t yet appear to be online in full , but Iâ€ ™ ll post a link when there is one .
An aside : there was a flurry of tweets from some reporters as Justice Leach began his ruling and appeared to set aside the appeal summarily .
Those comments were in fact in relation to a separate case .
My colleague Simon Allison reports from Johannesburg :
It is not yet clear whether Oscar Pistorius will return to prison immediately , or if he will be allowed to remain in correctional supervision until a new sentence is handed down .
As is custom , Pistorius and his family were not in the court in Bloemfontein as the judgment was delivered .
June Steenkamp , Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s mother , was present .
The Paralympic gold medallist was released into house arrest in October , having served one - fifth of his original five - year term , and has been performing court - mandated community service .
The appeal courtâ€ ™ s ruling was damning on the issue of Pistoriusâ€ ™ credibility .
His evidence and explanations for the shooting were described as â€œimplausibleâ€ � .
The judges said Pistorius â€œnever offered an acceptable explanationâ€ � for firing four times through the closed door .
Justice Eric Leach , reading the ruling on behalf of the five - judge bench , said : I have no doubt â€ ¦ the accused must have foreseen and therefore did foresee that whoever was behind that door might die .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ claim â€ “ one of several put forward by the defence â€ “ of putative private defence , or self - defence in fear of his life , was not rational , the judges said .
His evidence was so contradictory that it is impossible to know his true reason for firing , they concluded .
But it was clear the person behind the door did not pose any immediate threat to him .
The appeal court found that Judge Thokozile Masipa had made errors in law when reaching her original verdict of culpable homicide .
The appeal judges said Masipa was wrong in her application of dolus eventualis , as Pistorius â€œmust have foreseenâ€ � that firing into the door could cause the death of whoever was behind it .
Masipa also wrongly conflated the test of dolus eventualis with dolus directus in accepting that the defence argument that he did not know the person behind the door was Steenkamp meant he could not be guilty of murder .
Masipaâ€ ™ s verdict was premised upon an acceptance that Pistorius did not think Steenkamp was in the toilet , but this was also wrong : the key thing is that the perpetrator knows his actions could kill that person , whoever it is .
The failure to take into account all the evidence â€ “ in particular , key ballistics evidence â€ “ amounted to a failure in law , the judges said .
June Steenkamp , the mother of Reeva Steenkamp , was in the courtroom today to hear the judges rule â€ “ in a unanimous verdict â€ “ that Oscar Pistorius was indeed guilty of murdering her daughter .
Oscar Pistorius , now guilty of murder , is currently out of prison under house arrest .
The appeal court made no mention of this and it appears unlikely that he will be returned to jail right away .
It is not clear when the high court in Pretoria will reconvene for the fresh sentencing on the murder conviction .
Despite legal â€œerrorsâ€ � made by Judge Masipa , the appeal court says she conducted the trial with â€œdignity and patienceâ€ � in full glare of live television .
She will now have to re - sentence Pistorius for murder .
The culpable homicide verdict is set aside .
Pistorius must return to the Pretoria high court for a new sentence .
Leach says Pistorius should have been found guilty of murder .
Leach moves to the issue of putative private defence â€ “ in other words , whether Pistorius acted in self - defence in fear of his life .
His evidence is so contradictory that it is impossible to know his true reason for firing , Leach says .
But he says that Pistoriusâ€ ™ claim was not rational .
The person behind the door did not pose any immediate threat to him .
Pistorius did not fire even a warning shot .
Leach :
I have no doubt
â€ ¦ the accused must have foreseen and therefore did foresee that whoever was behind that door might die .
The identity of his victim is irrelevant to his guilt .
Leach says â€œin my viewâ€ � , he can not accept Pistoriusâ€ ™ version of events .
Pistorius â€œnever offered an acceptable explanationâ€ � .
The death of the person behind the door was an obvious result of firing through it , Leach adds .
That is exactly what the accused did .
The interests of justice can allow the court to set aside the conviction of culpable homicide , Leach says .
The consequences of Pistoriusâ€ ™ actions would have been obvious to anyone of reasonable intelligence , he adds .
He is still speaking â€ “
we have not quite heard the ruling yet .
The accused has already served the period of imprisonment imposed by the trial court , the defence argued , so the conviction should stand .
That is â€œundesirableâ€ � , Leach says â€ “ people must be convicted of the crimes they have committed .
Leach says it would be â€œwholly impractical and not in the public interestâ€ � to have a retrial .
The principles of dolus eventualis were incorrectly applied , Leach says .
The trial court did not correctly apply legal principles with regard to evidence .
He is moving towards his conclusion .
The failure to take into account all this evidence amounts to a failure in law , Leach says .
Thatâ€ ™ s the second point on which he has found for the state .
Leach queries whether this lack undermined the finding of the trial court .
He mentions what he calls â€œthe failure of the courtâ€ � to take into account the evidence of ballistics expert Captain Mangena .
It is clear that the toilet cubicle was extremely small , Leach says .
All the shots fired through the door would almost inevitably have struck the person behind it .
There would have been nowhere for Steenkamp to hide , he adds .
Leach is now looking at the issue of circumstantial evidence and citing other case law .
He says all evidence must be taken into account in the final judgment and implicitly criticises Masipa for dismissing some of that presented in the trial .
This first issue goes in favour of the state , Leach says .
The original trial court did make an error in law .
He will now examine other points of the appeal .
The issue is whether Pistorius could foresee that there was a person behind the door â€ “ whether Steenkamp or an intruder â€ “ who could die if he fired into it .
The trial court misdirected itself on this legal issue , he says .
â€œThere was a further fundamental error , â€ � Leach adds .
He says Masipaâ€ ™ s verdict was premised upon an acceptance that Pistorius did not think Steenkamp was in the toilet
and so he did not foresee that his actions could cause her death .
A perpetrator does not need to know the identity of his victim , he says , but still intend to kill the person â€ “ he cites the example of an indiscriminate bomber .
The key thing is that the perpetrator knows his actions could kill that person , whoever it is .
Leach says Masipaâ€ ™ s ruling was â€œconfusing in various respectsâ€ � .
The point was whether Pistorius foresaw the possibility of death when he fired into the door .
He says Masipa conflated the test of dolus eventualis with dolus directus in accepting that his argument that he did not know the person behind the door was Steenkamp meant he could not be guilty of murder .
The wrongdoer does not have to see death as the probable outcome of his actions , but as a possibility , Leach says .
He reads from Masipaâ€ ™ s verdict in which she concluded that Pistorius had not foreseen the possibility of death , and that he believed Steenkamp was in the bedroom .
This court can not interfere with the trial finding that the state failed to prove its case that Pistorius killed Reeva Steenkamp after an argument , Leach says .
To prove murder , there must be proof of intention to kill ( dolus ) .
Dolus eventualis means the perpetrator foresees the possibility of death , but goes ahead with his action anyway , â€œgambling with the lifeâ€ � of the victim .
The state may well feel justifiably aggrieved by the court acquitting someone when a conviction should have followed , says Leach .
But an acquittal by a competent court based on findings of fact may not be questioned , he says .
There would need to be errors of law .
( The state has argued that Judge Masipa incorrectly applied the legal principle of dolus eventualis . )
Leach is dealing with the original trial judgeâ€
™ s verdict : culpable homicide and a five - year sentence .
This court needed to determine whether the principle of dolus eventualis was correctly applied in that trial , he says .
Leach points out that Pistoriusâ€ ™ version of accounts changed a number of times : One really does not know what his explanation is for firing the fatal shots .
He says there were â€œother implausibleâ€ � elements to Pistoriusâ€ ™ version .
But the state failed to show that there had been an argument between the couple .
This ruling is not the quick , to - the - point explanation many were expecting .
Leach is running through in some detail the events of 14 February 2013 , the evidence , witnesses and Pistoriusâ€ ™ account .
We are hearing again about the phone calls Pistorius made after the shooting .
Leach now sets out the competing versions : the state said Pistorius and Steenkamp had an argument .
The defence maintained that Pistorius believed there to be an intruder in his house .
Leach is running through the accounts by witnesses of the moments after Steenkamp was shot .
Pistorius was charged with her murder , he says .
Much of what emerged at the trial was â€œcommon
causeâ€ �
â€ “ that is
, state and defence agreed that Pistorius fired four times through the toilet cubicle door .
Leach discusses the legal issue of whether the state was entitled to appeal to this court ( the defence argued it was not ) .
He says it was entitled .
He now turns to the matter of the appeal itself .
Leach says it is not disputed that Pistorius shot Steenkamp .
He is now running through the trial process and says he will refer to Pistorius as â€œthe accusedâ€ � as he was throughout that time .
He says he hopes the Steenkamp family will not mind if he refers to the victim as â€œReevaâ€ � .
Justice Eric Leach says he will read out the summary on behalf of the five - judge panel .
He says this case is â€œa human tragedy of Shakespearean proportionsâ€ � .
The judges have arrived .
The original trial catapulted what might once have been an obscure legal principle into the global spotlight .
Today the supreme court will decide if Judge Masipa got it wrong when she found Pistorius not guilty of murder .
But what does it mean ?
A simple explanation is that it hinges on whether an accused did foresee the outcome of his actions , rather than whether they should have .
In this case , Masipa accepted Pistoriusâ€ ™ argument that he did not think his actions would lead to the death of the person behind the door .
But in deciding that a reasonable person should have foreseen that , she did find him guilty of culpable homicide .
South African barrister Ulrich Roux argued after the verdict that the principle of dolus eventualis should have resulted in a murder conviction for Pistorius :
According to the law , someone is guilty of murder if they know that their actions could lead to the killing of a person and reconcile themselves to that fact , and act anyway .
In delivering her ruling , judge Thokozile Masipa said that â€œa reasonable person would have foreseen if he fired shots at the door , the person inside the toilet might be struck and might die as a resultâ€ � , which suggests a classic case of dolus eventualis .
But the judge seems to have cleared him of this charge because she felt that , to be guilty of common - law murder , Pistorius needed to have foreseen that his actions would kill a specific person
â€ “ Reeva Steenkamp â€
¦ I would say that the law is clear
â€ “
it doesnâ€ ™ t have to be a specific person whose death can be foreseen , it can be anyone .
My colleague Simon Allison reports from South Africa :
Last year , as South Africa prepared for Judge Thokozile Masipa to deliver her verdict , the country talked about little else .
Did Oscar Pistorius really think there was an intruder ?
Was he justified in firing anyway ?
Was he a murderer , or just a confused young man who had made a terrible mistake ?
Everyone suddenly became an expert in the relatively arcane legal concept of dolus eventualis , and all could argue the distinction between murder and culpable homicide .
This time round , as the Supreme Court of Appeal prepares to rule on his case again , Pistorius is no longer setting the national agenda .
The fate of the disgraced paralympian doesnâ€ ™ t dominate dinner table discussions , and newspaper columnists have moved on to other things .
South Africa seems to have been struck with a kind of Oscar - fatigue , the dominant emotion being relief â€ “ that today , one way or the other , the case will be finalised and we can all move on .
But of course , itâ€ ™ s not that simple .
If heâ€ ™ s found guilty of murder , then there is likely to be a sentencing trial , where defence and prosecution will once again be required to present arguments .
There is also the unpopular option of a retrial , which means weâ€ ™ ll be back to square one .
June Steenkamp , mother of Reeva Steenkamp , is in court today , accompanied by members of the ANC womenâ€ ™ s league : Only one of the panel of five judges â€ “ expected to be Justice Eric Leach â€ “ will read out their decision .
Itâ€ ™ s expected that Leach will read an abridged version of the ruling , with full papers distributed later .
Judge Thokozile Masipa took two days to deliver her original verdict , but itâ€ ™ s anticipated that this one will be over in a considerably shorter period .
The defence has asked the supreme court to dismiss the stateâ€ ™ s appeal .
Barry Roux , for the defence , said in the appeal hearing that the stateâ€ ™ s case rested on issues of fact , rather than points of law , and were therefore not a matter for the supreme court .
But he faced questioning from the judges over Pistoriusâ€ ™ intentions when firing into the tiny cubicle , with Judge Leach telling him : There was no place to hide in there â€ ¦
If you put four shots through that door you must surely see you will shoot someone .
Roux maintained that the trial judge was correct to apply the principle of dolus eventualis to the question of whether Steenkamp was in the cubicle , given that the judge had already accepted that Pistorius genuinely believed there was an intruder in the bathroom , and that his girlfriend was still in bed : Why would he just want to murder someone in the toilet , knowing sheâ€ ™ s in the bedroom ?
The defence insists that Pistorius was scared , vulnerable and on his stumps ; his state of mind rules out murder .
You can read our live blog of the appeal hearing here .
Here is a quick rundown of the prosecutionâ€ ™ s case for discarding the culpable homicide conviction in favour of one of murder .
The stateâ€ ™ s case
South Africaâ€ ™ s
supreme court of appeal heard arguments from state prosecutors that trial judge Thokozile Masipa was wrong when she found Oscar Pistorius not guilty of the murder of Reeva Steenkamp .
Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel told the panel of five judges that Masipa had erred in her application of the legal principle of dolus eventualis , and that she was wrong to conclude that Pistorius had not foreseen that firing four shots into a locked door was likely to kill or injure the person behind it .
Masipa further erred in her exclusion of dolus eventualis because she accepted that Pistorius believed Steenkamp was in bed , Nel argued : there was a criminal intent to bring about the demise of whoever was inside the toilet cubicle .
( On this point , at least one judge openly agreed . )
The state further alleged that the trial judge was wrong to dismiss circumstantial evidence that it said proved the accusedâ€ ™ s version of events to be impossible .
Nel argued that the supreme court was entitled to overturn the decision of the high court , because the finding that Pistorius was guilty of culpable homicide was a de facto acquittal on the charge of murder .
Neither state nor the defence â€œhas the stomachâ€ � for a retrial , Nel said , as he asked the appeal court to instead impose its own verdict of murder : He had defences that exclude each other â€ ¦ The one he elected to use , the court rejected that one and gave him another one .
The court should have rejected his evidence as impossible â€ ¦
On the objective facts , the accused can not escape a verdict of murder .
Welcome to live coverage as South Africaâ€ ™ s supreme court delivers its decision in the stateâ€ ™ s appeal against Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ conviction for the culpable homicide of Reeva Steenkamp .
Prosecutors want that conviction upgraded to one of murder , arguing that Pistorius must have known that firing four bullets through the door of a tiny toilet cubicle could kill the person behind it .
Steenkamp was killed in Pistoriusâ€ ™ home in Pretoria in the early hours of 14 February 2013 .
Today at 9.45am in Bloemfontein ( 7.45am GMT/6.45pm AEDT ) , one of the panel of five judges will read out their decision .
If they rule that the original trial judge erred in finding Pistorius guilty of the lesser charge , it is likely that the case will be referred back to the high court in Pretoria for fresh sentencing .
Alternatively they could decide that Judge Thokozile Masipa applied the law correctly , and the culpable homicide conviction and five - year sentence will stand .
Pistorius is currently living under house arrest at his uncleâ€ ™ s home in Pretoria , having been freed from prison after serving less than a year behind bars .
This live blog will have all the latest news and I will be tweeting key developments @Claire_Phipps ."
2015-12-03,"South Africaâ€ ™ s supreme court of appeal has found Oscar Pistorius guilty of murder , marking another dramatic day in a case that has gripped the world from the moment news first broke of Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s death .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s sentence will now be revised at the Pretoria high court , although no dates for this have been announced , and the Olympic and Paralympic athlete is expected to return to jail .
The ruling comes just weeks after Pistorius was released from prison into the relative luxury of correctional supervision at his uncle Arnoldâ€ ™ s home in Pretoria .
The appeal court ruling means he is unlikely to be there for much longer : the minimum sentence for murder is 15 years in prison , three times the term he received following his original conviction of culpable homicide , the South African equivalent of manslaughter .
Even the judges at the supreme court of appeal were not immune from the extraordinary highs and lows of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s story , with Justice Eric Leach â€ “ who read the judgment in Bloemfontein on Thursday morning
â€ “ summing it up in unusually descriptive terms .
â€œThis case involves a human tragedy of Shakespearean proportions , â€ � he said .
â€œA young man overcomes huge physical disabilities to reach Olympian heights as an athlete .
In doing so he becomes an international celebrity , he meets a young woman of great natural beauty and a successful model , romance blossoms , and then , ironically on
Valentineâ€ ™ s
Day , all is destroyed when he takes her life.â€ �
There are more legal battles to come , however â€ “ first a sentencing hearing on the new murder conviction , and then a possible constitutional court hearing .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s disability
â€
“
he is a double amputee â€ “ will be central to defence arguments , and may be what elevates the case from a criminal to a constitutional matter .
â€œFirst , the sentencing procedure has to get under way .
Thereâ€ ™ s a minimum 15 years sentence for murder , but there is judicial discretion on this , if there are compelling circumstances .
We will hear evidence about his disability and how heâ€ ™ s not an appropriate candidate for a long incarceration , especially because his psychiatric report revealed he had suicidal tendencies , â€ � said Karyn Maughan , a journalist with local broadcaster eNCA who has been following the trial closely .
Maughan said the defence might invoke his disability to take the matter to the constitutional court .
â€œThey could say that the appeal court fundamentally misinterpreted dolus eventualis , â€ � she said , â€œand that they didnâ€ ™ t give due account to his status as a double amputee or his general anxiety disorder .
These are psychiatric issues which may mean he shouldnâ€ ™ t be evaluated by the same standards as others.â€ �
Before the Pistorius case , few in South Africa had ever heard of dolus eventualis , or indirect intention , the obscure legal concept around which the Pistorius case revolves .
In simple terms : did Pistorius contemplate the possibility that he might kill somebody when he pumped four bullets into the bathroom door ?
And , having contemplated that possibility , did he choose to proceed anyway , recklessly endangering someoneâ€ ™ s life in the process ?
The appeal courtâ€ ™ s
verdict on these questions was unanimous .
â€œIn these circumstances
, I have no doubt that in firing the fatal shots the accused must have foreseen that whoever was behind the toilet door might die , but reconciled with that event occurring , and gambled with that personâ€ ™ s life , â€ � said Leach , reversing the trial judge Thokozile Masipaâ€ ™
s decision on the matter .
The court also found that Pistorius was not justified in claiming that he thought his own life was in danger , again overturning Masipaâ€ ™ s ruling .
Kelly Phelps , criminal law expert at the University of Cape Town , argued that the appeal courtâ€ ™ s determination on dolus eventualis was not sufficient in itself to overturn Pistoriusâ€ ™ s conviction for culpable homicide , but when he could no longer rely on putative private defence , this became inevitable .
â€œDolus eventualis ended up being the least impactful part of this case in terms of the ultimate verdict , â€ � Phelps said .
â€œThe real punchline of this judgment was actually the reversal of Judge Masipaâ€ ™ s factual finding on putative private defence.â€ �
She said she believed the case was headed for the constitutional court .
â€œIâ€ ™
d be very surprised if there wasnâ€ ™ t a massive effort going on now to establish constitutional grounds for an appeal .
The key thing with the constitution is that the scope of appeals is very broad .
If one looks hard enough , you can almost always find a constitutional ground for an appeal .
In a case like this , which is already in exceptional terrain because the state has taken the unusual step of appealing a conviction , there are big legal questions around double jeopardy and the legal ambit of the supreme court of appeal , â€ �
she said .
Another potential ground for a further appeal is the unprecedented media coverage that the case has received .
In the original trial , Pistoriusâ€ ™ s defence put it on record that a number of witnesses refused to testify as they were afraid of being in the spotlight .
This , it could be argued , has compromised his right to a fair trial .
In a short statement , Pistoriusâ€ ™ s family said they would be guided by Pistoriusâ€ ™ s legal team in terms of their next steps .
â€œWe will not be commenting any further at this stage , â€ � they said .
While for Pistorius the continued legal battles are his only chance of avoiding more prison time , for Steenkampâ€ ™ s family the saga merely prolongs their heartache .
They have been forced to grieve in public , in the full glare of the worldâ€ ™ s attention .
For June Steenkamp , Reevaâ€ ™ s
mother , it all became too much on Thursday and after the ruling was announced she sobbed outside the court .
For Reevaâ€ ™ s father , Barry Steenkamp , the decision represented some kind of closure .
â€œI would hope to God that all of this could have been prevented , but seeing that it has been done , let us now all get on with our lives , â€ � he said .
Thursdayâ€ ™ s ruling was welcomed by the African National Congress Womenâ€ ™ s League , who have been vocal critics of Pistorius and strong supporters of the Steenkamp family .
â€œWe are happy with what the judges decided today , â€ � said the leagueâ€ ™ s
Free State chair , Mapaseka Nkoane .
â€œWe want to say to men out there , let the killings of women stop.â€ �
The appeal courtâ€ ™ s
deconstruction of her rulings makes for grim reading for trial judge Masipa , who has been on the receiving end of intense and often personal criticism ever since she issued her judgment last year .
Given the media interest , her verdicts have received more attention than any others ever made by a South African judge .
But the appeal court , in an unusual coda to its judgment , emphasised that this should not tarnish her reputation .
â€œThe trial judge conducted the hearing with a degree of dignity and patience that is a credit to the judiciary .
The fact that this court has determined that certain mistakes were made should not be seen as an adverse comment upon her competence and ability .
The fact is that different judges reach different conclusions and , in the light of an appeal structure , those of the appellate court prevail.â€ �"
2015-12-03,"Thokozile Masipaâ€ ™ s decision last year to find Oscar Pistorius guilty of culpable homicide rather than murder prompted an outcry from legal experts from the outset .
Firing four shots at an unknown intruder , or whoever was in the confined space behind the toilet door , was surely done with the knowledge that anyone there could be killed , a number of South African lawyers argued .
Some questioned whether the trial judge had focused too closely on Pistoriusâ€ ™ s relationship with Reeva Steenkamp .
And others said the test used to ascertain whether there had been dolus eventualis
â€ “ the Latin term used to say the accused is deemed to have foreseen the outcome of their actions â€ “ had been misapplied .
On Thursday many of those critics felt justice had , finally , been done .
Mahlatsi Malaka , a lawyer in in Bloemfontein , branded the original verdict â€œan error of judgmentâ€ � .
â€œ[Pistorius ] had intention to kill regardless of who was behind the door ,
â€ � she told Associated Press .
â€œThat should have been the conviction of the trial court.â€ �
At the time , Dr David Klatzow , a leading South African forensic scientist , echoed her concerns .
He told the Guardian last September : â€œIt was irrelevant whether it was Reeva or anybody else behind that door .
There is a provision in South African law that [ self - defence ] force must be proportional to the threat and reasonable .
â€œIf I shot someone who is punching my wife that would be unreasonable .
Your life and that of anyone else has to be in immediate , mortal danger .
Iâ€ ™ m not sure that it was ever shown [ that he was ] in immediate mortal danger .
[ Such a claim ] could be measured against his veracity in the witness box , which did him no favours .
â€œEveryone here owns a firearm and they have to undergo a written examination in which this is one of the issues .
Anybody who fires a 9 mm pistol will know about the lethal nature of those bullets .
Iâ€ ™ m surprised the judge found him not guilty of murder.â€

Emma Sadleir , an expert on social media law , pointed out at the time that there had been close precedent in a case in which a South African rapper , Jub Jub , had been found guilty of murder after racing a car through the streets of Soweto and ploughing into a crowd of schoolchildren , killing four of them .
â€œThe judge in that case said that he should have foreseen the possibility of the deaths and returned a verdict of murder , â€ � said Sadleir .
In the Pistorius case , she added , the likelihood of death resulting from opening fire in such a confined space was far greater .
It was this kind of argument that prevailed during the appeal hearing at South Africaâ€ ™ s supreme court .
The chief prosecutor , Gerrie Nel , told the panel of five judges that Masipa had erred in her application of the legal principle of dolus eventualis , and that she had been wrong to conclude that Pistorius had not foreseen that firing four shots into a door was likely to kill or injure the person behind it .
Masipa had also been mistaken , the supreme court was told , in her exclusion of dolus eventualis because she accepted that Pistorius had believed Steenkamp was in bed .
Pistorius will now face a far longer sentence for murder and is likely to return to prison ."
2015-12-04,"Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s mother June has called the murder verdict handed to Oscar Pistorius a sign of respect for her daughter and said she forgives him .
In her first comments since the appeal court ruling on Thursday , she said : â€œNow weâ€ ™ ve seen that the justice system works .
Itâ€ ™ s about respect for my daughter , how wonderful she was , how clever she was , all that was taken away from her.â€ � .
Pistorius shot and killed his girlfriend on Valentineâ€ ™ s Day in 2013 .
Originally convicted of culpable homicide , the South African equivalent of manslaughter , the supreme court of appeal said the Paralympian was guilty of murder .
June Steenkamp was present as the court handed down its decision , as she has been throughout the long legal process .
After the verdict , she was seen sobbing on the steps of the court house .
She was calm and composed in the interview with the state broadcaster SABC .
â€œI see this as the truth .
And the success is due to the justice system and God ,
â€ �
she said .
â€œThis is respect for my daughter and her life also , and respect for women all over this country , because we have too much of this happening and people get away with it .
â€œLife was taken .
And the person who took the life must pay the price now .
If you do the crime , you have to do the time .
Iâ€ ™ m not really interested in how much time , but Iâ€ ™ m happy with the verdict .
I feel better we have justice for her .
She hasnâ€ ™ t been forgotten .
She wonâ€
™ t be forgotten.â€ �
Steenkamp said she had forgiven Pistorius .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t want to hurt him in any way
â€
¦
To move on in life , you have to forgive .
I have forgiven him , and I donâ€ ™ t wish him any harm .
He just has to pay for what heâ€ ™ s done , and take responsibility for what heâ€ ™ s done.â€
�
She said the case had destroyed her family .
â€œA big part of their life has been taken away .
They were all close to Reeva ,
â€ �
she said .
â€œOscar is actually still alive but his family have suffered also .
You have to think of that .
Two families totally destroyed because of what happened .
But at least we have the truth now and the right decision and the right judgment.â€ �
Steenkamp praised South Africaâ€ ™ s justice system , and said she did not care how long Pistorius spent behind bars .
â€œIt doesnâ€ ™ t make a difference to me if itâ€ ™ s five years or six years .
Itâ€ ™ s not going to change my life because my daughter is never coming back .
You have to let go of that now .
Iâ€ ™ ll just carry on with my work , and if I can save one more woman Iâ€ ™ ll be happy.â€ �
Steenkamp said the stress had been too much for Barry Steenkamp , her husband and Reevaâ€ ™ s father .
â€œHe had a stroke , itâ€ ™ s been too much for him ,
â€ �
she told the interviewer .
â€œI
didnâ€ ™ t want him to travel , because he wasnâ€ ™ t well .
I was afraid if he went to court he would take the strain and the stress , and I didnâ€
™ t know how he would react to being so close to Oscar in the court .
I wanted to keep him away from that.â€ �"
2015-12-07,"Oscar Pistorius could be back in jail as early as Tuesday morning if a bail hearing does not go in his favour .
The North Gauteng high court will decide whether to return the athlete to prison immediately or grant bail until a new sentencing next year .
Pistorius will attend the hearing .
Last week the supreme court of appeal found him guilty of murder for the killing of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp , overturning a previous conviction for culpable homicide .
Pistorius was originally sentenced to five years in prison .
In November he was released into correctional supervision at his uncleâ€ ™ s house in Pretoria to serve the remainder of his term .
In South African law , the minimum sentence for murder is 15 years in prison , unless extenuating circumstances can be proved .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s sentencing hearing is expected in the second quarter of 2016 .
Until then , he is likely to remain confined at his uncleâ€ ™ s house or be returned to prison , depending on the courtâ€ ™ s decision on Tuesday .
The National Prosecuting Authority ( NPA ) had been expected to request a warrant for Pistoriusâ€ ™
s arrest to guarantee his presence , but his lawyers agreed that he would appear on Tuesday on the basis of â€œvoluntary surrenderâ€ � .
The NPA did not indicate whether they intended to oppose bail or not .
The hearing should offer clues as to whether Pistorius intends to appeal against his murder conviction in the constitutional court , and if so on what grounds .
According to local media reports , Pistorius is terrified of returning to prison .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t want to go back to jail .
Itâ€ ™ s a terrible place , so disgusting you
canâ€ ™ t imagine , â€ � he reportedly told Kevin Lerena , a friend .
Lerena said he was worried that Pistorius may â€œdo something stupidâ€ � if he is incarcerated again ."
2015-12-08,"Oscar Pistorius will not return to prison while awaiting sentencing for murdering his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , a South African court has ruled .
The athlete will remain under house arrest at his uncleâ€ ™ s home after the prosecution declined to oppose bail at a hearing in the North Gauteng high court in Pretoria on Tuesday morning .
Deputy judge president Aubrey Ledwaba granted bail of R10,000 ( Â£460 ) on condition that Pistorius remains under house arrest .
â€œHe has proved that he is not a flight risk , â€ � the judge said .
Pistorius was present in court , dressed in a dark suit and tie , remaining calm and composed throughout , and occasionally sharing a joke with his lawyers .
Before the hearing began , he had agreed to the strict conditions of his house arrest , which mostly confine him to Arnold Pistoriusâ€ ™ s mansion in Pretoria .
Pistorius shot and killed Steenkamp on Valentineâ€ ™ s Day in 2013 .
He was found guilty of murder last month after the supreme court of appeal overturned a previous conviction for culpable homicide , the South African equivalent of manslaughter .
The murder conviction comes with a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison .
The bail payment is due by 11 December , a trivial sum in comparison to the R1 m ( Â£46,000 ) guarantee he lodged ahead of his original trial .
This illustrates the toll that the legal proceedings has taken on the finances of Pistorius , once a multimillionaire .
â€œWe also agreed to an amount of bail of R10,000 because in his affidavit heâ€ ™ s discussed he doesnâ€
™ t have the means to pay a higher amount , â€ � said the chief prosecutor , Gerrie Nel .
Pistorius is next scheduled to appear in court on 18 April to confirm the next steps in the legal process .
Absent from the court was June Steenkamp , Reevaâ€ ™ s mother , who has attended most other legal proceedings .
Also missing was the large crowds of onlookers , both Pistorius fans and critics , which were a striking feature of the original trial .
The purpose of Tuesdayâ€ ™ s court proceedings was to determine whether Pistorius should return to prison , pending a new sentencing hearing , or if he will remain under house arrest .
Pistorius was released into correctional supervision earlier this year after having served one - sixth of his original sentence .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s legal team , led by Barry Roux , made clear its intention to challenge the appeal courtâ€ ™ s decision in South Africaâ€ ™ s highest court , the constitutional court .
This new appeal will be heard next year , before any sentencing hearing .
Roux said Pistorius did not pose a flight risk .
â€œHe is a well - known person , heâ€ ™ s got a disability .
Heâ€
™ s abided by all the bail conditions , all the time , and heâ€ ™ s got a history where heâ€ ™ s shown that he commits himself to the structures of the criminal justice
system.â€
�
Nel said that the severity of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s crime merited harsh bail conditions .
â€œWe have a convicted murderer applying for bail .
The conditions therefore should be stricter , â€ �
he said .
The prosecution , however , was unsuccessful in its argument that Pistorius should not be allowed to leave the house without permission .
Ledwaba said this requirement would create unnecessary work for the investigating officer required to grant permission , and instead granted Pistorius permission to leave the house between 7 am and midday .
He will be electronically tagged to monitor his compliance with this condition and will no longer be required to perform community service , the judge ruled ."
2015-12-08,"Iâ€ ™ m wrapping up this live blog now , but you can read a full summary in the post below and our news story is here : Oscar Pistorius will stay out of jail at least until he returns to court on 18 April 2016 after Judge Aubrey Ledwaba agreed that he should remain on bail , despite his fresh conviction for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp .
Bail was set at just 10,000 rand ( less than Â£500 ) , payable by Friday , after the defence said Pistorius had no money left .
Ledwaba said it would not be in the interests of justice to restrict Pistorius to house arrest at his uncleâ€ ™ s Pretoria home for 24 hours a day , as the state had requested , so allowed him to keep his current freedom to leave the house between 7 am and midday every day .
He will be electronically tagged , and must keep within a 20 km radius of the house and surrender his passport .
We also learned that the defence will submit an appeal to the constitutional court against the murder conviction .
Pistorius will be electronically tagged and must submit travel plans to the investigating officer ( whose cell phone number the judge has just read out on global television ) .
The judge says Pistorius will be able to leave the house every day between 7 am and midday and can travel within a 20 km radius of his uncleâ€ ™ s home .
He must not leave the district of Tshwane .
He must hand over his passport and must not apply for a new one .
Ledwaba says he does not think it is in the interests of justice for Pistorius not to leave the house at all .
He makes the following order : Case postponed till 18 April 2016 .
Pistorius is released on bail of 10,000 rand .
Ledwaba says the defence wants bail to be granted while Pistorius applies to appeal against his murder conviction in the constitutional court .
He says Pistorius has proved that he is not a flight risk .
Even when facing possible life imprisonment , when charged with premeditated murder , he kept his bail conditions .
The state and the defence broadly agree on the bail application , the judge says .
But it is up to the court to decide , he points out , as is the case with any bail conditions .
Ledwaba asks Pistorius to stand .
Since the accused has now been accused of a more serious crime that could attract a sentence of 15 years or more , the judge says , the court needs to look carefully at the bail application .
Ledwaba asks about the 10,000 rand bail .
Nel says it needs to be paid to the court registrar by this Friday or bail will lapse .
Judge Aubrey Ledwaba is back to deliver his ruling on whether Pistorius can remain on bail under house arrest , or must return to jail .
We are still waiting for the judge to return with his decision on bail .
Two key revelations from the hearing so far : The terms of Pistoriusâ€ ™ current house arrest allow him to leave his uncleâ€ ™ s home every day between 7 am and midday .
Although we knew he was carrying out community service , those precise terms were not previously known .
The bail bond now offered by the defence is just 10,000 rand ( less than Â£500 ) , as Pistorius , according to his lawyer , has no money .
While we wait for the judgeâ€ ™ s decision , hereâ€ ™ s what the hearing revealed : Oscar Pistorius will appeal against his conviction for murder , taking the challenge to the constitutional court .
In the meantime , the defence argues that he should be allowed to remain on bail , albeit under stricter house arrest conditions .
The state does not oppose bail , but wants Pistoriusâ€ ™ current permission to leave his uncleâ€ ™ s home between 7 am and midday rescinded .
Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel told the court : We feel strongly that we need to monitor the accused 24 hours .
We feel strongly that he should not leave the house at any time .
Judge Aubrey Ledwaba said he was minded to allow Pistorius to travel outside the house within a certain radius , but has not yet given his final ruling .
Both sides have agreed that Pistorius should be subject to electronic monitoring .
Bail is now fixed at 10,000 rand ( less than Â£500 ) , rather than a previous 1 m rand guarantee .
Defence attorney Barry Roux told the court of the higher sum : He doesnâ€ ™ t have that money .
Judge Ledwaba asks Pistorius to confirm that the affidavit is in his name
â€ “
he agrees , the first and only time he has spoken in this hearing .
The judge adjourns the court for 15 minutes to consider his decision .
Iâ€ ™ ll have that ruling in this live blog as soon as court resumes .
Judge Ledwaba says he is strongly considering allowing Pistorius to leave the house , but only to travel within a certain radius .
It depends on what the radius would be , Nel says .
I would want a radius of 10 km around his house , the prosecutor eventually concedes .
Roux says such a radius was provided for by the defence , which suggested the magisterial district of Tshwane .
Ledwaba asks the size of the district ; itâ€ ™ s apparently about 30 km .
Thereâ€ ™ s an airport in that district
, Nel argues â€ “
he doesnâ€
™ t want Pistorius anywhere near that .
The only thing Pistorius can lose in absconding is 10,000 rand , Nel says â€ “ Roux has already pointed out that this bail bond is the most the defendant can afford .
Even with electronic monitoring , itâ€ ™ s easier to monitor someone in a specific place .
The state doesnâ€ ™ t want to have to monitor his movements if he is travelling out of the house every day .
Things are different now , Nel maintains : Pistorius is convicted of murder now .
He faces a minimum 15-year sentence .
He needs to be monitored 24/7 , Nel insists .
The judge wants to know why the state wants to change the terms of the house arrest , which previously allowed Pistorius to leave his uncleâ€ ™ s home between 7 am and midday .
Nel says it was the stateâ€ ™ s request : We feel strongly that we need to monitor the accused 24 hours .
We feel strongly that he should not leave the house at any time .
Nel is back on his feet .
He says the state is â€œcomfortableâ€ � that the house arrest and electronic monitoring .
He doesnâ€
™ t think the appeal to the constitutional court will be successful , but acknowledges Pistoriusâ€ ™ right to do so .
Pistorius is not a flight risk , Roux says : he has been tested on this , he is a well - known person and he has a disability .
There is no danger and no risk for the criminal justice system .
Roux confirms that Pistorius will appeal to the constitutional court .
Bail is fixed at 10,000 rand , Roux says .
The previous 1 m rand guarantee has been cancelled , Roux says : He doesnâ€ ™ t have that money .
Pistorius has served the â€œsentence requiredâ€ � of his original five - year term , Roux says â€ “ that is , one - sixth of the sentence in prison , the remainder under house arrest ( where he is currently ) .
The accused has offered to proceed with the house arrest , but with stricter conditions .
Roux says defence and state have agreed that Pistorius should remain under house arrest , leaving the premises only with the permission with the investigating officer or the prosecuting authority .
Pistorius would also consent to â€œelectronic monitoringâ€ � .
The precedent throughout the case has been that Pistorius has been allowed bail , Roux tells the judge .
But as the murder conviction is a schedule five offence , the defence now has to prove â€œexceptional circumstancesâ€ � for bail to be granted .
Barry Roux , for the defence , submits an affidavit in support of bail .
Pistorius was previously allowed bail when charged with premeditated murder , Roux points out .
Nel tells the judge that the defendant is now a â€œconvicted murdererâ€ � .
But he is not opposing the application for bail .
Deputy judge president Aubrey Ledwaba has arrived in court .
Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel begins for the state .
Reporters in the high court say no members of Pistoriusâ€ ™ family have accompanied him to court today , apparently at his request .
No members of Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s family are expected to attend either .
Oscar Pistorius has arrived in court : It is also possible that we will hear today if the defence team intends to appeal the supreme court ruling : South African legal experts have said it could be possible for Pistorius to appeal to the constitutional court , but this is a rare step .
The key to such an appeal might be for the defence to argue that he did not receive a fair trial â€ “ for example , if potential witnesses were deterred because the trial was televised worldwide .
Alternatively it could hinge once again on the courtâ€ ™ s interpretation of the law around dolus eventualis ( read more about that here ) .
Oscar Pistorius was last week found guilty of the murder of Reeva Steenkamp , in an appeal court ruling that set aside his original conviction for culpable homicide .
The supreme court judges decided : As a result of the errors of law â€ ¦ and on a proper appraisal of the facts , he ought to have been convicted not of culpable homicide on that count but of murder .
In the interests of justice the conviction and the sentence imposed in respect thereof must be set aside and the conviction substituted with a conviction of the correct offence .
The panel of five judges , who were unanimous in their verdict , said Pistoriusâ€ ™ evidence and explanations for killing Steenkamp were â€œimplausibleâ€
�
and he had â€œnever offered an acceptable explanationâ€ � for firing four times through a closed door .
The appeal court said the original trial judge , Thokozile Masipa , had been wrong on several points of law , chief among them her conclusion that Pistorius had not foreseen that his actions could kill somebody ( dolus eventualis ) .
Justice Eric Leach , reading the ruling on behalf of the bench , said : I have no doubt â€ ¦ the accused must have foreseen and therefore did foresee that whoever was behind that door might die .
The judges said it was clear that Pistorius had criminal intent in firing , and was therefore guilty of murder by dolus eventualis ( see here for what that means ) .
Todayâ€ ™ s bail hearing will determine whether Pistorius remains out of prison â€ “ albeit under house arrest conditions â€ “ until he appears again in front of Judge Masipa for fresh sentencing .
Oscar Pistorius will appear in court today to hear if he will return to jail immediately , after the supreme court last week overturned his conviction for culpable homicide and found him guilty of the murder of Reeva Steenkamp .
Pistorius is currently living under house arrest at his uncleâ€ ™ s home in Pretoria , having been released from prison in October after serving less than one year of his original five - year sentence .
On Tuesday at around 9.30am local time ( 7.30am GMT/6.30pm AEDT ) , Pistorius will appear at the North Gauteng high court in front of deputy judge president Aubrey Ledwaba .
It is not yet known if the state will oppose bail , or will seek more stringent restrictions on his house arrest .
The National Prosecuting Authority ( NPA ) had been expected to request a warrant for his arrest to guarantee his presence in court today , but his lawyers said he would appear on the basis of â€œvoluntary surrenderâ€ � .
Itâ€ ™ s also likely that the court today will set a date â€ “ almost certainly in 2016 â€ “ for the fresh sentencing on the murder conviction .
And we could hear if the defence intends to launch its own appeal , to the constitutional court , against the supreme court decision .
I will be covering the hearing live here , and will post key developments @Claire_Phipps ."

2016-03-03,"South Africaâ€ ™ s constitutional court has rejected a last - ditch attempt by Oscar Pistorius to appeal against his conviction for the murder of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp .
â€œWe can confirm that Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ s leave to appeal has been denied â€ ¦
The court dismissed the application for leave to appeal because there are are no prospects of success , â€ � Luvuyo Mfaku , spokesperson of the National Prosecuting Authority , told reporters .
Pistorius , a Paralympic champion , shot dead Steenkamp , a 29-year - old model and law graduate in 2013 .
He now faces a possible minimum 15-year jail sentence .
Pistorius ran on prosthetic extensions attached to his legs in the 2012 London Olympics , becoming one of the best known athletes in the world .
He was born with a birth defect which led to the amputation of his legs beneath the knees when he was 11 months old .
The trial of the athlete known as the Blade Runner was closely followed around the world .
Pistorious killed Steenkamp when he fired a handgun through the closed door of a toilet in his home in Pretoria .
In December last year the supreme court of appeal found him guilty of murder , reversing a 2014 ruling by the high court in Pretoria , which had only found him guilty of culpable homicide , or manslaughter .
Steenkampâ€ ™ s relatives welcomed that verdict .
â€œNow weâ€ ™ ve seen that the justice system works .
Itâ€ ™ s about respect for my daughter , how wonderful she was , how clever she was , all that was taken away from her ,
â€ �
Steenkampâ€ ™ s mother , June , said .
In January the former sprinter sought leave to appeal to the constitutional court to overturn the murder conviction .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s legal team argued the supreme court of appeal ignored his vulnerability as a person with a disability .
It believes the court wrongly rejected a lower courtâ€ ™ s judgment that Pistorius acted out of fear when he opened fire at what he thought , by his account , was an intruder in his home .
The appeals court said that regardless of who Pistorius said he thought was behind the door , he should have known someone could be killed if he fired .
Prosecutors had told judges Pistoriusâ€ ™ s appeal to South Africaâ€ ™ s highest court against the murder conviction was â€œcontrivedâ€ � and without merit .
Andrew Fawcett , a defence lawyer , confirmed the courtâ€ ™ s decision and said :
â€œWeâ€ ™ ll proceed to the sentencing.â€ � Pistorius , 29 , was granted bail under house arrest in December following the supreme court verdict .
He is currently fitted with an electronic tag and lives at his uncleâ€ ™ s mansion in Pretoria .
He is next due in court on 18 April for fresh sentencing on the murder conviction .
The athlete was originally sentenced to five years in prison for the culpable homicide conviction , but was released one year later under house arrest .
Anneliese Burgess , the Pistorius family spokeswoman , said she would issue a statement after consulting with the family ."
2016-04-18,"Oscar Pistorius will be sentenced in June for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp , a court in South Africa has confirmed .
The former Paralympianâ€ ™ s culpable homicide conviction
â€ “ and its five - year prison sentence
â€ “ was overturned by the supreme court in December 2015 , when appeal judges instead found him guilty of murder .
On Monday , Pistorius was in court in Pretoria as Judge Aubrey Ledwaba , who presided over an earlier bail hearing , told him he would face a fresh sentencing hearing from 13 - 17 June .
Pistorius spoke only to confirm that he understood the judgeâ€ ™ s decision .
The athlete , who is living at his uncleâ€ ™ s home in Pretoria , will remain on bail until the new hearing .
His lawyer told the court that his tracking device , which he wears on his wrist , had malfunctioned several times , alerting him that he had broken bail conditions while he was in fact at home .
Pistorius had always denied intentionally killing Steenkamp , his girlfriend , in his Pretoria home in the early hours of 14 February 2013 .
He insisted throughout his lengthy trial that he had mistaken her for an intruder , shooting four times through a locked toilet cubicle door , killing her instantly .
At his original trial , Judge Thokozile Masipa accepted this version of events , ruling that there was no evidence that Pistorius had wanted to kill Steenkamp , but that his actions had been negligent .
But the supreme court found that Masipa had wrongly applied the legal principle of dolus eventualis , which hinges on whether an accused should have foreseen the outcome of his actions .
Pistorius â€œmust have foreseenâ€
� that firing into the door could cause the death of whoever was behind it , the judges said .
Describing Steenkampâ€ ™ s death as â€œa tragedy of Shakespearean proportionsâ€ � , the judges said : â€œThe accused ought to have been found guilty of murder.â€ �
An attempt by Pistoriusâ€ ™ s legal team to have that finding thrown out by the constitutional court ,
South Africaâ€ ™ s highest judicial authority , was denied in March and he has no further avenues of appeal against the conviction .
The minimum sentence for murder is 15 years in prison , but the defence is likely to argue that Pistoriusâ€ ™ s disability â€ “ both his legs were amputated as a young boy â€ “ and the time he has already served in jail should be taken as mitigating factors .
Pistorius was originally handed a sentence of five years for the culpable homicide conviction and served just under a year in prison .
He was released under house arrest in October 2015 , before the state successfully challenged the verdict in the supreme court .
It is expected that Masipa will be the judge who hands down the new sentence in June ."
2016-05-05,"A feature - length documentary is to be made about the former Paralympian and convicted murderer Oscar Pistorius .
The film , which will be titled Pistorius , is to be directed by Vaughan Sivell , who also made the 2015 boxing documentary Mr Calzaghe .
The project will be shopped to distributors next week at Cannes film festival .
The South African athlete became the first double - amputee sprinter to compete in the Olympics in 2012 .
In 2013 , he was arrested after fatally shooting his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , in their home .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s culpable homicide conviction was overturned in 2015 and appeal judges found him guilty of murder .
He is currently awaiting a new sentence that will be announced in June .
â€œThe film will seek to discover whether the image we have of [ Pistorius ] is the truth , â€ �

Cut and Pasteâ€ ™ s melodies are glorious â€ “ single Daffodil Days is surging and swoonsome â€ “ but with lyrics so surface , you sometimes wish heâ€ ™ d get out a bit more ."
2016-06-11,"Four years ago , Oscar Pistorius , still a hero rather than a murderer , was about to compete in the London Olympics against enabled athletes , running on his carbon - fibre blades .
Not everyone was happy about this .
The German team , for instance , said his Flex - Foot Cheetahs used 25 % less energy and were unfair to natural runners .
How was it fair to ban all doping , then allow one athlete to use special technology ?
It was against fair play , the spirit of the Games .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s supporters were incredulous that anyone could accuse an awe - inspiring double amputee of having an unfair advantage .
That was definitely against the spirit of the games .
In the event , after Pistorius failed to qualify for the menâ€ ™ s 400 m final , it was he who complained most bitterly , after being beaten at the Paralympics by Brazilâ€ ™ s Alan Fonteles Cardoso Oliveira .
The winnerâ€ ™ s blades were too long , Pistorius said .
He wanted an official investigation .
â€œI believe in fairness in sport , â€ � he said ,
â€œand I believe in running on the right length.â€ �
With Pistorius and his blades out of the way , suspicions about sporting unfairness have returned to doping , whose detection is now practically a sport in itself , albeit a little on the slow side .
Details are still emerging , thanks in part to whistleblowers , of the substantial contribution made by banned performance - enhancing drugs to the excitement at Sochi 2014 .
In its 2015 report , the World Anti - Doping Agency ( Wada ) said a cheating Russian team had effectively â€œsabotagedâ€ � the London Games , assisted by official inaction , and called for Russia to be barred from international athletics .
A decision on Russian athletesâ€ ™ participation in Rio is imminent .
Definitely absent from sport for the next two years will be their compatriot , Maria Sharapova , the tennis star and the worldâ€ ™
s
highest paid female athlete for 11 consecutive years .
She has benefited , it emerges , from a fantastic sounding drug called meldonium , which is said to improve stamina and even , not unlike PG Wodehouseâ€ ™ s fabled Buck - U - Uppo , give the user â€œmental focusâ€ � and a â€œsharper edgeâ€ � .
Alas , thanks to Sharapova , the online price has reportedly soared , from Â£15 to Â£27 for 40 tablets , the athleteâ€ ™ s personal endorsement evidently carrying more weight than official warnings about the danger of unlicensed drugs and , indeed , meldoniumâ€ ™ s designation , by Wada , as against â€œthe spirit of sportâ€ � .
One of
Wadaâ€ ™ s purposes , its director general has explained , is to discourage the use of performance - enhancing drugs at the amateur as well as elite level , where it also constitutes a â€œchallenge to the values of sport and its integrityâ€ � .
Those values , he specified , included â€œethics , honesty , respect for rules , self - respect and respect for others , fair play and healthy competitionâ€ � .
If those donâ€ ™ t already sound quaint , given the colossal investment that rich countries consider a fair price for one medal , Wada may want to consider how sporting values accord with the IOCâ€ ™ s recent decisions on competition between individuals whose biology is so different that , some predict , fair play in certain womenâ€ ™ s events could become impossible .
The former Olympic champion Sonia Oâ€ ™ Sullivan has drawn attention to the latest triumphs of Caster Semenya , the South African sprinter who is now predicted to win a gold medal in Brazil .
She won a silver medal in London , then faltered , not even qualifying for the 2014 Commonwealth Games .
The reason usually advanced for Semenyaâ€ ™ s impressive return to form is the Court of Arbitration for Sportâ€ ™ s ( CAS ) decision to suspend an earlier ruling by the IAAF that put an upper limit on testosterone for intersex athletes competing in womenâ€ ™ s events .
It was designed to ensure â€ “ at some cost to the dignity of intersex women athletes â€ “ fairness for the majority , who have much lower testosterone levels .
Last year , the ruling was the subject of a legal challenge by the Indian sprinter Dutee Chand , arguing her right to compete without taking testosterone - suppressing drugs .
The CAS duly suspended the regulations and asked for more evidence that high levels of testosterone confer a performance benefit .
â€œTo me , that CAS decision seems ludicrous , â€ � Oâ€ ™ Sullivan writes .
â€œThatâ€
™ s the one marker that created the imbalance in performance and which has long been known.â€ �
Adding yet more interest to future womenâ€ ™ s events is the IOCâ€ ™ s decision to allow people who self - identify as women to participate in the 2016 Games , including , for the first time , women who have not physically transitioned .
The contestants must , however , have kept their testosterone levels below 10 nanomoles per litre for a year .
Women usually have fewer than three nmol / L.
If the potentially arresting consequences seem to be have been subjected , as yet , to relatively little public examination , it probably , as with Pistoriusâ€ ™ s blades , seems more in the spirit of the Games to welcome a landmark triumph over exclusion and discrimination for athletes who have as much right to compete as anyone .
The question is , when athletes are routinely segregated , in the interests of fairness , according to sex , often weight , against whom ?
Only the Games themselves will show if the cost of fairness for transgender and intersex women will be its loss â€ “ contrary to the spirit of the Games â€“for cis women athletes .
Then again , thereâ€ ™ s nothing particularly fair about the Olympics , unless athletes from wealthy and powerful countries are just naturally better than athletes from everywhere else .
Why shouldnâ€ ™ t intersex athletes enjoy their victories ?
But Joanna Harper , a physicist , athlete and trans woman , who is an adviser on gender issues to the IOC , says of the suspension of testosterone limits : â€œAllowing these [ intersex ] athletes to compete in womenâ€ ™ s sport with their serious testosterone - based advantage threatens the very fabric of womenâ€ ™ s
sport.â€ �
The IOCâ€ ™ s declared emphasis in Rio , on protecting â€œclean athletesâ€ � from the dopers , may only add to the indignation of some women competitors , held back by average hormone levels .
O ne solution , if testosterone is not all the help itâ€ ™ s cracked up to be , would be to remove it from the banned list of pharmaceuticals , to allow for individual topping up .
And if that led to demands , from people who donâ€ ™ t fancy the side - effects , for testosterone alternatives , there is surely a place for niche tonics such as Sharapovaâ€ ™ s Buck - U - Uppo or Lance Armstrongâ€ ™ s preferred androstenone
, the active ingredient in â€ “ really
â€ “ Boarmate .
As well as sparing athletes the incessant testing that never , anyway , keeps up with cheatingâ€ ™ s finest , the freedom to take any safe , performance - enhancing drug would guarantee , for the audience , Olympics that are genuinely , as advertised , ever faster , higher and stronger .
It would be a shame if any sudden leap forward in Brazil were restricted to womenâ€ ™ s events , courtesy of newly validated contestants .
If , however , the overriding sporting objective of fair competition dictates that pharmacological advances continue to be excluded from the range of athletics - enhancing innovations â€ “ from competitive swimsuits to the â€œsecret
techâ€ � promised by British cyclists
â€ “ the IOC might be advised to remind women in certain events of the importance of being a good loser .
Itâ€ ™ s the taking part that counts , right ?
â€¢ Comments will be opened later"
2016-06-12,"Barry Steenkamp , the father of murdered model Reeva Steenkamp , could give evidence for the first time in the trial of Oscar Pistorius this week .
Steenkamp was too unwell following the death of his daughter to attend Pistoriusâ€ ™ s trial and watched it on television from home .
His wife June sat in the courtroom through weeks of harrowing testimony .
On Monday , the original trial judge , Thokozile Masipa , will hear pre - sentencing arguments at Pretoria high court .
The Sunday Telegraph has reported that Steenkamp wanted to take the stand later this week to testify at the former Paralympianâ€ ™ s sentencing hearing .
A source told the Sunday Telegraph : â€œHe is very fragile but he wants to do it .
If he can , it will be very powerful and emotional testimony.â€ �
Pistorius is preparing to be sentenced for an upgraded murder conviction , after the supreme court in December 2015 overturned the manslaughter verdict .
Murder in South Africa carries a mandatory life sentence with a minimum of 15 years .
Pistorius has been denied the right to appeal .
However , his sentence could be reduced to take into account time already served .
â€œHe has served one year in prison and has been effectively on probation or correctional supervision , â€ �
Stephan Terblanche , a law professor at the University of South Africa , said .
â€œBut exactly how that is going to be taken into account by the court is difficult to predict.â€ � Pistorius killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentineâ€ ™ s Day 2013 , saying he mistook her for an intruder when he fired four times through the door of his bedroom toilet .
In March , Pistoriusâ€ ™ s lawyers failed in their legal bid to reverse a supreme court of appeal judgement that upgraded his original conviction from culpable homicide â€ “ the equivalent of manslaughter â€ “ to murder .
He was released from jail in October 2015 to live under house arrest at his uncleâ€ ™ s mansion in Pretoria after serving one year of his five - year original sentence .
Since being convicted of murder , he has been on bail and allowed to leave the house at set times , but not travel further than 20 km ( 12 m ) without permission .
The case at the high court in Pretoria was scheduled to start on Monday and last until Friday , though the sentence could be handed down earlier .
Pistorius was last seen in public at a court hearing in April when the date of the sentencing was announced .
Agence France - Presse contributed to this report"
2016-06-13,"The first day of the hearing to determine what sentence Oscar Pistorius will receive for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp has concluded .
Here are the key developments .
Two witnesses will speak in mitigation
The defence says it will call two witnesses : the first , psychologist Professor Jonathan Scholtz , gave evidence today .
The second , so far unnamed , will speak about Pistoriusâ€ ™ charity work .
Scholtz :
Pistorius should not return to prison Scholtz said in his view Pistorius was â€œbrokenâ€ � and should be in hospital rather than prison .
Further imprisonment would have a detrimental effect on him .
[ It ] would not be psychologically or socially constructive .
Mr Pistorius would be better served â€ ¦ if he gave back in a positive and constructive way , using his skills .
The doctor said Pistoriusâ€ ™ depression , anxiety , paranoia and social phobia had worsened since his trial .
He has post - traumatic stress disorder but is not a psychopath .
Scholtz said Pistorius can not bear the sound of gunfire , even on television , and has sold all his firearms .
Pistorius will not testify Scholtz said did not believe Pistorius was fit to testify in this hearing : I donâ€ ™ t think he is able to be a witness in this trial : his condition is severe .
But chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel asked why Pistorius had then been able to give an interview to Britainâ€ ™ s
ITV , to be broadcast next week .
â€˜His risk of reoffending is lowâ€ ™
The former athlete has participated in courses on anger management and restorative justice , and the doctor believed his risk of violent reoffending was low .
But he was â€˜verbally violent and aggressiveâ€ ™ in prison Nel said a separate report by a prison psychologist found Pistorius was â€œverbally violent and aggressiveâ€ � towards staff .
Scholtz justified omitting this report from his own , saying it was a â€œpoor reportâ€ � and â€œunscientificâ€ � .
Barry Roux , for the defence , said an episode in which Pistorius banged a table came after he had been denied access to a painkilling drug , Voltaren , for three weeks .
There are conflicting versions of his time in prison
The prosecution argued that information in the psychological report about Pistorius being assaulted in prison and witnessing a hanging were untrue .
Scholtz rejected a prosecution claim that two antidepressant drugs â€ “ Molipaxin and Cipralex â€ “ found in Pistoriusâ€ ™ cell were â€œillegalâ€ � .
Pistorius â€˜accepts he murdered Steenkampâ€ ™ Nel pushed Scholtz to confirm if Pistorius now admitted intentionally firing into the door and the person behind it ( Pistorius had previously insisted it was an accident and/or self - defence ) :
Nel :
Did Mr Pistorius indicate to you that he intentionally shot at the door knowing there was a person in the bathroom ?
Scholtz :
Yes â€ ¦ Nel :
Thatâ€ ™ s the first version of him intentionally shooting at the person that weâ€ ™
ve had in this court .
Itâ€ ™ s not clear if the Steenkamps will testify
Nel has not yet revealed how many witnesses he will call , or who they will be .
Reports suggested Barry Steenkamp , Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s father , might appear in aggravation of sentence .
Nel said June Steenkamp had forgiven Pistorius , but â€œfor her sake , not for his sakeâ€ � .
Scholtz told the court Pistorius had paid the Steenkamps R6,500 a month because : This is the kind of person he is â€
¦
It was not seen by him as some kind of means to change anything â€ ¦
This is what he does : he helps .
The court resumes on Tuesday at 9.30am local time ( 7.30am GMT ) , when we expect to hear from the second witness for the defence .
The live blog will return then .
Thanks for reading and for your comments and questions .
Scholtz and Roux agree that two medications found in Pistoriusâ€ ™ cell , one of which was Molipaxin ( apologies , I did not catch the name of the second drug ) , were â€œnot illegalâ€
� .
Both are antidepressants .
[ Edit : a reader via Twitter points out that the second drug mentioned was Cipralex .
Many thanks . ]
The witness is now excused .
The first witness testimony is done .
Court now adjourns to tomorrow at 9.30am local time ( 8.30am GMT ) .
I will post a summary of todayâ€ ™ s events shortly .
Barry Roux says Pistorius paid the R6,500-a - month to the Steenkamp family without any conditions .
Scholtz :
This is the kind of person he is â€
¦
It was not seen by him as some kind of means to change anything â€ ¦
This is what he does : he helps .
It comes almost naturally to him and he enjoys doing it .
Roux turns to the incident mentioned by Nel in which Pistorius apparently banged his hands on a table .
Roux says Pistorius was frustrated because he had swollen hands and a medicine ( Voltaren , an anti - inflammatory drug ) brought to the prison by his family was not given to him .
Scholtz says this was a situation of high stress .
One incident doesnâ€ ™ t mean that a person has a violent personality .
Barry Roux , for the defence , is on his feet again for re - examination .
He asks Roux to read from a different section of the prison psychologist report , which concludes that the risk of reoffending is low .
Scholtz says he agrees with this part .
Why were you at first reluctant to take on the writing of this report , Nel asks Scholtz .
Scholtz says it was an â€œethical dilemmaâ€ �
â€ “ because he had already assessed Pistorius in 2014 , and â€œyour objectivity is affected the second timeâ€ � .
Youâ€ ™ re biased towards the accused , Nel alleges .
Scholtz says he merely tried to â€œpresent the court with this person in the fullest extentâ€ � .
He wanted the court to â€œsee the person that is being sentencedâ€ � .
Thatâ€ ™ s
it â€ “ Nel takes his seat .
If someone is suffering from PTSD , is it safe for him to work with children , Nel wants to know .
Scholtz says he wouldnâ€ ™ t expect there to be any problem .
Pressed by Nel he says Pistorius might â€œsnapâ€ � if there was a confrontation , or pressure builds up , or an argument â€ “ but says this is unlikely to be a problem working with children .
Nel says Scholtz failed to include the negative portions of the prison psychologist report in his own report .
Scholtz said in his own assessment he â€œcould not find any anger or aggressionâ€ � in Pistorius .
Gerrie Nel is not letting go of this point .
He continues to read from the prison psychologist report , which says that Pistorius refused to acknowledge he had committed a crime .
Scholtz says he saw Pistorius a year later : It is not like that now .
He knew that you were seeing him to draft a report for re - sentencing , Nel says .
Judge Masipa intervenes :
she wants to know more about the prison psychologist report .
It says that at the beginning he struggled to adapt to prison life and was verbally violent , she says .
It doesnâ€ ™ t say anything about him being violent in nature .
Scholtz agrees : I am happy with my view that he is not a violent man .
Scholtz says he spent 27 hours with Pistorius and it was not his impression that he was violent and aggressive .
Nel says the prison psychologist saw Pistorius on three occasions .
Scholtz insists the report is â€œlimitedâ€ � .
Scholtz says he thought the report was â€œunscientificâ€ � .
Nel is incredulous : it is a factual paragraph , he says .
Why did you not talk to the prison psychologist if you did not agree with her , he asks : Why would you select only positive things that suits your view â€ ¦
Why would you do that ?
Why was the prison psychologist report not included in Scholtzâ€ ™ s report , Nel wants to know : You never mentioned another report to this court :
why ?
Scholtz says he didnâ€ ™ t want to â€œsingle outâ€ � a colleague .
He didnâ€ ™ t agree with her findings .
Scholtz says he did read that report , but he â€œdidnâ€ ™ t deem it necessaryâ€ � to refer to it in his own report .
Nel :
I know why .
He reads from the report , which says Pistorius was â€œverbally violent and aggressiveâ€ � towards staff in prison .
Scholtz says he thought it was a â€œpoor reportâ€ � .
He says Pistorius was going through an â€œadaptationâ€ � of being incarcerated .
Nel :
I find your answers to be totally biased to the accused .
They are not objective .
Do you think you can be objective , Nel asks Scholtz .
Are you able to put all factors before the court , positive and negative ?
Scholtz says yes , he can be objective .
Having gone through a trial would cause depression , wouldnâ€ ™ t it , Nel asks Scholtz .
The doctor agrees that it would exacerbate depression .
He says there is no â€œeasy fixâ€ � , it could take years for his condition to improve .
Scholtz : There is consistent adversity .
The trial isnâ€ ™ t finished , he doesnâ€
™ t know where he stands .
Nel wants to know about Pistoriusâ€ ™ current medications .
Scholtz says yes , for depression , anxiety and insomnia , prescribed by his own psychiatrist , Dr Bosch .
Youâ€ ™
re of the opinion that Pistorius needs to be hospitalised , Nel says â€ “ donâ€ ™ t you think you should have mentioned this to the psychiatrist ?
Scholtz said he mentioned it to Bosch and to the defence .
Did Bosch or the defence counsel do anything , Nel wants to know .
No , Scholtz says .
Judge Masipa arrives and the hearing begins again .
Gerrie Nel requested this lengthy break in order to consult with prosecution experts about the report by psychologist Dr Jonathan Scholtz , a witness appearing for the defence .
Oscar Pistorius , who left the courtroom during the break , is now heading back .
The hearing is due to resume in around 20 minutes .
The court has now taken a break until 2.30pm local time ( 12.30pm GMT ) to allow the state to consult its own experts on the contents of the defence psychiatric report .
Hereâ€ ™ s what weâ€ ™ ve heard so far in this first morning of Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ sentencing hearing for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp :
First defence witness
The defence says it will call two witnesses to argue in mitigation : the first , Professor Jonathan Scholtz , has been giving evidence today .
The second , so far unnamed , will speak about Pistoriusâ€ ™ charity work .
Scholtz said in his view Pistorius was â€œbrokenâ€ � and should be in hospital rather than prison .
Further imprisonment would have a detrimental effect on him .
[ It ] would not be psychologically or socially constructive .
Mr Pistorius would be better served â€ ¦ if he gave back in a positive and constructive way , using his skills .
The doctor said Pistoriusâ€ ™ psychological condition â€ “ including depression , anxiety , paranoia and social phobia â€ “ had worsened since his trial .
He has post - traumatic stress disorder but displays no indication of psychopathy .
Scholtz said Pistorius can not bear the sound of gunfire , even on television , and has sold all his firearms .
He did not believe Pistorius was fit to testify in this hearing : I donâ€ ™ t think he is able to be a witness in this trial : his condition is severe .
The former athlete has participated in courses on anger management and restorative justice , and the doctor believed his risk of violent reoffending was low .
Cross - examination Gerrie Nel , for the state , repeatedly pushed Scholtz to confirm whether Pistorius had taken responsibility for murdering Steenkamp and if he had admitted intentionally firing into the door and the person behind it ( previously , Pistorius has insisted it was an accident and/or self - defence )
: Nel :
Did Mr Pistorius indicate to you that he intentionally shot at the door knowing there was a person in the bathroom ?
Scholtz :
Yes â€ ¦ Nel :
Thatâ€ ™ s the first version of him intentionally shooting at the person that weâ€ ™
ve had in this court .
Nel told Scholtz that June Steenkamp had forgiven Pistorius for her daughterâ€ ™ s murder â€œfor her sake , not for his sakeâ€ � , after the doctor suggested this was a mitigating factor in sentencing .
The prosecutor argued that information in the psychological report about Pistorius being assaulted in prison and witnessing a hanging were untrue , and said he had acted aggressively towards a prison staff member .
And Nel wondered why , if Pistorius was too unwell to speak at this hearing , he had been able to give an interview to ITV , to be broadcast next week .
Iâ€ ™ ll be back with further live updates when the court resumes .
Nel says he would like the court to take a break so his own experts can look at Scholtzâ€ ™ s report .
He asks for the court to adjourn until 2.30pm .
The court takes a break .
This did happen , Nel says .
It happens to all inmates , when inspectors come to the prison .
That is not the context here , says Scholtz .
Nel cites Scholtzâ€ ™ s earlier testimony that while in prison , Pistorius overheard an inmate being raped and later saw that the man had hanged himself .
Nel :
That did not happen â€ ¦
Perhaps if Mr Pistorius was here [ on the stand ] he could have testified to that .
Nel says Pistorius complained a lot in prison .
Itâ€ ™ s a different thing to complain about being assaulted , in a place where that shouldnâ€ ™ t happen , than to complain about having â€œno soapâ€ � , Scholtz argues .
Pistorius had access to an open courtyard , Nel points out , but the doctor says he was often too afraid to use it , â€œsomething might happen to him thereâ€ � .
Nel turns to Pistoriusâ€ ™ period of imprisonment .
He was not confined to his cell , Nel says , contrary to Scholtzâ€ ™ s report .
Scholtz says his understanding is that he was confined â€œmost daysâ€ � for up to 18 hours a day .
Nel says his cell was open during the day and he could move around the section he was held on .
Scholtz says he was too fearful to leave his bed :
He had fear because someone did go through into his section and assaulted him there .
Itâ€ ™ s not true , Nel says .
He didnâ€
™ t report this .
Itâ€ ™ s a lie , he says .
Nel :
Your report deals with the accused and whatâ€ ™ s best for the accused .
It doesnâ€ ™ t take other factors into account .
I just find it peculiar that you place a lot of emphasis [ on ] the negative media as a factor that impacts on the accused â€ ¦ You indicate that â€˜his children may in future search the internet and find negative report of the trialâ€ ™ .
Donâ€ ™ t
you think the fact the father murdered somebody is more significant than negative reports ?
Nel turns to the money paid by Pistorius to the Steenkamp family : R6,500 a month , which continued for about 17 months .
He doesnâ€ ™ t want that back , Scholtz says .
The prosecutor says the R6,500 was viewed as part payment for a civil claim â€œby all parties concernedâ€ � and was meant to be kept confidential : It then came out in the trial from the accusedâ€ ™ s side .
June Steenkamp has said Pistoriusâ€ ™ apology in court left her â€œunmovedâ€ � , Nel tells Scholtz .
Scholtz says he understands that Pistorius did try to contact Steenkampâ€ ™ s family directly after her death .
Did he try to contact them after he left prison , Nel asks .
No , says Scholtz .
Nel says that would have been a good opportunity to do so .
Scholtz says Pistorius thought he might do so â€œat a later stageâ€ � .
Nel says there was an attempt by Pistorius to meet the family â€ “ in April , during preparations for the sentencing arguments .
Judge Masipa intervenes :
the state wants to know what Pistorius told the doctor , not what the doctor understands from the court judgment .
She allows the question .
Nel :
Did Mr Pistorius indicate to you that he intentionally shot at the door knowing there was a person in the bathroom ?
Scholtz says yes , he did .
Nel says that would be the first admission by Pistorius .
He says he doesnâ€ ™ t accept it .
Thatâ€ ™ s the first version of him intentionally shooting at the person that weâ€ ™
ve had in this court .
Nel says he would have liked to have been able to question Pistorius on this admission .
Listen carefully , Nel tells the witness .
Did Pistorius tell you he armed himself and intentionally shot through the door ?
Scholtz says he did not ask Pistorius this question .
So he intended to kill a person , just not Steenkamp , Nel asks .
Scholtz agrees â€ “ but Nel presses him .
Thatâ€ ™ s his view , not that of Pistorius .
Nel wants to know if Pistorius himself agrees that he intended to kill a person .
Scholtz :
Perhaps these are legal nuances that I donâ€
™ t understand properly .
Nel pushes on .
Did he tell you he intended to shoot through the door at the person ?
Barry Roux chips in
: it is getting too technical , he says .
Itâ€ ™ s unfair to the witness , he adds .
He says the court ruled that Pistorius foresaw that he could kill someone and proceeded anyway ( dolus eventualis ) .
Itâ€ ™ s not about intending to kill .
Nel wants to know why Scholtz believes Pistorius has taken responsibility for his actions .
Did he accept that he killed her intentionally , Nel asks .
Scholtz says even though he didnâ€
™ t know it was Steenkamp behind the door , he does accept he killed her .
He accepts he took a human life when he shouldnâ€ ™ t have and that is murder .
Thatâ€ ™ s your view , not his , says Nel .
Scholtz says Pistorius does accept it was murder because the court has said so .
( Nel is pushing him very hard on this point , and what Pistorius himself has actually said . )
Does he accept he intentionally fired four shots into the door , Nel asks .
Yes , says Scholtz .
He has never admitted that to the court , Nel says .
He says this is yet another version of events from Pistorius .
Nel asks how Scholtz knows that the family of Reeva Steenkamp forgives Pistorius .
Scholtz says he has seen a letter they wrote to the parole board .
Reevaâ€ ™ s
mother , June Steenkamp , wrote a book , Nel says .
Scholtz doesnâ€ ™ t know about this .
Nel reads from the book , A Motherâ€ ™ s Story .
He says she has forgiven him â€œfor her sake , not for his sakeâ€ � , because of her faith .
Nel now turns to the doctors who saw Pistorius while he was in prison .
Scholtz says he knows he was visited by his private psychologist but is not aware of the others .
How then can you talk about the infection in his stumps , Nel asks .
Scholtz says he was concerned with the psychological effects .
Nel turns to the medication Scholtz says Pistorius has been taking .
Scholtz confirms he has not seen the medication or the dosage , but has relied on what Pistorius told him .
Nel asks about Pistoriusâ€ ™ â€œtemper tantrumsâ€ � while in prison .
He was â€œso
agitatedâ€ � when talking to someone in prison ( named as Sister Mashabane ) that â€œhe banged a table in her presenceâ€ � in January 2015 .
Scholtz isnâ€ ™ t aware of this incident .
Nel :
He got so upset â€ ¦
He approached her in her office , he was shaking and he banged the table .
Nel asks Scholtz if he ever discussed with Pistorius why he fired the shots through the toilet cubicle door .
He did not .
Why , Nel asks .
Scholtz said in his view it no longer mattered what Pistorius thought about it , but what the court had ruled .
But , Nel says , you deal with his remorse .
Isnâ€
™ t it key that he accepts what he did ?
Scholtz says Pistorius does accept that he took Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s life .
Nel says there is a difference between accepting â€œI took her lifeâ€ � and â€œI murdered herâ€ � .
It could be remorse for himself , he adds .
Scholtz says he canâ€ ™ t â€œclinically substantiateâ€
� the idea that Pistorius only feels sorry for himself .
( The live stream at the top of the blog doesnâ€ ™ t seem to have noticed this , apologies . )
Defence witness Dr Jonathan Scholtz is now being questioned by Gerrie Nel , for the state .
Scholtz told the court that Pistorius is not in a fit state to testify , but Nel wonders how he was able to do an interview with international media .
( Pistorius has been interviewed for Britainâ€ ™ s ITV , for a programme to be shown after this hearing . )
Scholtz says he did not know about the interview , and learned about it only yesterday .
During the break , it appears Pistorius approached the mother of Reeva Steenkamp but was rebuffed : Oscar Pistorius has not spoken in court , and we donâ€ ™ t expect him to be called to testify .
The defence said it would present two witnesses : Dr Jonathan Scholtz , who has said so far this morning that a further period of imprisonment would be â€œdetrimentalâ€ � to Pistorius ; and a second witness who will apparently talk about Pistoriusâ€ ™ charity work .
Hereâ€ ™ s Pistorius arriving at the court this morning .
Scholtz reiterates his earlier assertion that Pistorius ought to be under medical supervision : If he was my patient in private practice , I would admit him to hospital .
The court now takes a short adjournment .
Scholtz is asked by Roux to turn to a theme aired during the original trial : the notion of â€œtwo Oscarsâ€ � .
The first Oscar being the athlete , tall on his prostheses , confident ; the second the man on his stumps , anxious and vulnerable .
Thereâ€ ™ s more on that from the original trial here : Scholtz says there is â€ “ almost â€ “ now a third Oscar , one who has given up , whose spirit is broken and does not have hope for the future .
Scholtz says he has concluded that Pistorius should not be returned to prison : Further imprisonment would have a detrimental effect on him .
[ It ] would not be psychologically or socially constructive .
Mr Pistorius would be better served â€ ¦ if he gave back in a positive and constructive way , using his skills .
For the first five weeks in prison , Pistorius had no chair to sit on while showering and contracted an infection in his stumps , Scholtz says .
He overheard the rape of a fellow inmate who later hanged himself .
Pistorius was held separately from other prisoners for his safety , but the isolation had a negative effect on him , like â€œan animal in a cageâ€ � .
It was effectively solitary confinement , Scholtz says .
There were several â€œhumiliating and hurtfulâ€ � experiences inside prison , he tells the court .
Scholtz says Pistorius has displayed â€œtrue remorseâ€ � and contributed financially to Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s family for several months â€œwithout expecting the money backâ€ � .
Scholtz says the Steenkamp family has forgiven him .
He has complied with all conditions of his house arrest .
Scholtz says it is â€œgood
practiceâ€ � to consider the offenderâ€ ™ s personality as well as the facts of the case .
His conclusion for the court is that the following points could be taken into account : He is a first - time offender , intelligent , enrolled for a degree at the University of London .
He has a supportive family , a home , and a job offer .
He has spent 12 months in prison .
He does not have any substance abuse problems .
He is not antisocial or psychopathic .
The risk for violent reoffending is low .
He has a major depressive disorder , â€œwith anxious distressâ€ � ; and post - traumatic stress disorder , social phobia , agoraphobia and panic disorder .
His mental health has deteriorated since 2014 .
In laymanâ€ ™ s terms , one would describe him as â€˜brokenâ€ ™ .
In my opinion his current condition requires hospitalisation He has taken responsibility for his actions .
He wants to â€œcontinue helping peopleâ€ � and has previously made a positive contribution to society .
He was a positive role model and â€œhis fall from grace has been significantâ€ � .
The offence was caused by his â€œhuman frailtiesâ€ � , not avarice .
He did not benefit from the murder .
He is a vulnerable person , physically , socially and psychologically .
Pistorius has plans for a life outside prison , Scholtz tells the court : Pistorius has sold all his firearms and never wants to touch one again , Scholtz says .
He adds that Pistorius told him it was wrong to take a human life , and only god could do that .
Scholtz concludes that Pistorius is not a future danger : The risk for future violence was low .
Scholtz reads out a comparison of Pistoriusâ€ ™ test results from his 2014 assessments and his most recent ones .
For most , his condition has worsened , he says .
His agoraphobia has increased , he says , in line with Pistoriusâ€ ™ â€œgeneral feelings of vulnerabilityâ€ � .
He has â€œsocial phobiaâ€ � â€ “ an â€œextreme self - consciousness and anxiety about being ridiculed and embarrassedâ€ � .
This underlying tendency has worsened as a result of his arrest and trial , the doctor concludes .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ depression has worsened since 2014 â€œbecause he was unable properly to mourn the deceasedâ€ � , Scholtz says .
He also cites attacks on social media as a contributory factor to the depression .
According to Scholtzâ€ ™ s assessments , Pistorius rates high for paranoia and depression but low for psychopathic behaviour .
Mr Pistorius suffers from serious symptoms of depression â€ ¦
Mr Pistorius does not have the personality characteristics usually associated with antisocial personality disorder or psychopathy .
[ He has ] a distrustful disposition , which explains his paranoia as he feels he is always being watched by the media .
The sound of gunfire is now unbearable for Pistorius , the doctor says , even on television .
Scholtz says Pistoriusâ€ ™ relationship with Reeva Steenkamp was only the second romantic relationship in which he felt â€œreal companionshipâ€
� :
He often was approached by beautiful girls like models , but never reacted to their offers .
Scholtz says Pistorius takes solace in the knowledge that Steenkamp is now in godâ€ ™ s hands .
He was â€œgenuine in his affection for the deceased â€ ¦ there were no signs of abuse or coercionâ€ � .
Scholtz turns to the murder of Reeva Steenkamp : All of this changed when the incident took place in 2013 â€ ¦ his fall from grace was enormous .
Although he received support from many quarters , he was vilified by many .
He dealt with the trial â€ ¦ as best he could , but was unable to properly mourn the deceased .
Pistorius was not allowed to attend Steenkampâ€ ™ s funeral , Scholtz says : He was severely traumatised by the events .
Scholtz says Pistoriusâ€ ™ mother installed in him the idea that â€œgod had a special plan for himâ€ � and encouraged him not to think of himself as disabled .
There were no behavioural problems throughout his time at school .
His life became â€œvery structured and pre - determinedâ€ � when he moved into professional athletics .
The doctor goes on to mention Pistoriusâ€ ™ appearance in a Time list of 100 influential people and an honorary degree from Strathclyde University .
Scholtz talks about Pistoriusâ€ ™ family background , including his motherâ€ ™ s preoccupation with fear of crime and her death when he was 15 .
He is estranged from his father but has a close relationship with his uncle .
His sister Aimee Pistorius recently left South Africa , Scholtz says , because of the stress of the court case .
This was a â€œbig lossâ€ � for Oscar Pistorius , the doctor says .
Scholtz says in his view :
I donâ€ ™ t think he is able to be a witness in this trial : his condition is severe .
In his assessments , he found : His mood was anxious and depressed â€ ¦
He tended to derail and become tangential at times .
Pistorius was preoccupied with the upcoming sentencing and his guilt , Scholtz says , displaying symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorder .
He is taking medication for depression , anxiety and insomnia .
Pistorius has attended several courses , Scholtz says , including sessions on anger management and restorative justice .
Scholtz runs through the list of people he spoke to for his current assessment , including Pistorius himself and family members , as well as his correctional services officer and a private psychologist .
He says he requested an interview with the parents of Reeva Steenkamp , but this was declined .
Scholtz talks through his 2014 assessment of Pistorius : you can read about that from our report at the time here .
That report concluded that Pistorius had post - traumatic stress disorder and a major depressive disorder , and could be considered a suicide risk .
Roux says the defence asked only that Scholtz should assess Pistorius and did not give him further instructions about the nature of his report .
This new report has now been handed to the judge .
Scholtz says he had consultations with Pistorius , including a psychometric assessment and a risk assessment , and interviewed others who might have supporting information .
The defence calls its first witness : Professor Jonathan Scholtz .
He says he works at Weskoppies psychiatric hospital , the University of Pretoria and private practice .
Roux says a report by Scholtz was previously presented to the court when he acted as an expert witness after Pistorius was referred by the court for a mental health evaluation .
Scholtz says he was concerned about the â€œethical implicationsâ€
� when he was approached by the defence to compile his current report .
He concluded after consultation that the move was sound .
Gerrie Nel , the lead prosecutor begins .
He runs through the sequence of events that has brought everybody back to this court .
Barry Roux says the defence will call two witnesses : Pistoriusâ€ ™ psychologist and someone who will talk about his charity work .
It appears at this stage that Pistorius himself will not testify .
Judge Thokozile Masipa has entered and the hearing is underway .
Masipa presided over the original trial that resulted in a verdict of culpable homicide â€ “ and cleared Pistorius of murder .
Now the supreme court of appeal has overturned that decision and found Pistorius guilty of murder , Masipa will hear arguments from the defence and the state about how long his sentence should be .
Reporters in the Pretoria high court say there is an unusually heavy police presence within the courtroom , with the hearing about to begin ; one reporter counted 18 officers following Pistorius into the room :
Oscar Pistorius has arrived at the court , and was ushered swiftly into the building by police officers past the waiting media .
His defence team , including lead counsel Barry Roux , is already in the courtroom , as is Gerrie Nel , for the state .
The Steenkamp and Pistorius families are already in the courtroom , though Oscar Pistorius himself is yet to arrive .
Both Barry and June Steenkamp , the parents of Reeva Steenkamp , are present .
There have been reports that Barry Steenkamp â€ “ who has not previously spoken in court â€ “ might appear as a witness for the prosecution to argue for a strong sentence for the man who killed his daughter .
Aimee Pistorius and Carl Pistorius , the siblings of Oscar Pistorius , are also in attendance , along with wider family , including Arnold Pistorius , his uncle , at whose home the disgraced athlete has been living under house arrest since October 2015 .
His estranged father Henke Pistorius is also in court .
How did we get here , more than three years after Pistorius shot dead Reeva Steenkamp at his Pretoria home , firing four bullets through a locked toilet cubicle door ?
In 2014 , the former athlete was found guilty by Judge Masipa â€ “ after a trial lasting many months â€ “ of culpable homicide , but cleared of murder .
Masipa found that while Pistorius had acted recklessly , he had not intended to kill Steenkamp .
But an appeal court last December overturned that ruling , finding him guilty of murder .
The five supreme court judges ruled unanimously :
As a result of the errors of law â€ ¦ and on a proper appraisal of the facts , he ought to have been convicted not of culpable homicide on that count but of murder .
In the interests of justice the conviction and the sentence imposed in respect thereof must be set aside and the conviction substituted with a conviction of the correct offence .
The judges said Masipa had been wrong on several points of law , chief among them her conclusion that Pistorius had not foreseen that his actions could kill somebody ( a legal principle known as dolus eventualis ) .
Justice Eric Leach , reading the ruling on behalf of the bench , said : I have no doubt â€ ¦ the accused must have foreseen and therefore did foresee that whoever was behind that door might die .
This weekâ€ ™
s sentencing hearing â€ “ officially a continuation of the original trial â€
“ takes place once again in front of Masipa , who will decide the fresh sentence .
Welcome to live coverage as what looks to be the final stage of the long trial of Oscar Pistorius for the death of Reeva Steenkamp gets underway in Pretoria today .
Pistorius will appear before his original trial judge , Thokozile Masipa , for a sentencing hearing , as his lawyers seek to persuade the court that his circumstances mitigate against the minimum jail term for murder of 15 years .
The hearing is expected to take several days , perhaps until Wednesday .
The judge will then retire to consider the arguments in mitigation and aggravation of sentence , and could return with her decision as early as Friday â€ “ although she could take as long as a week .
Pistorius has so far served one year inside Kgosi Mampuru II prison , and has spent the months since he was released in October 2015 under house arrest conditions at his uncleâ€ ™ s home .
It is expected that his legal team will argue that this should be taken into account when determining any further sentence .
Itâ€ ™ s possible , though not confirmed , that Pistorius could take the stand himself .
The state is expected to put forward witnesses , with reports this weekend suggesting that Barry Steenkamp , the father of Reeva , could take the stand .
It would be his first testimony in court , after ill - health forced him to watch much of the original trial unfold on television .
Reeva Steenkamp was shot dead by Pistorius at his home in the early hours of 13 February 2013 .
He claimed he had believed her to be an intruder , but an appeal court last year ruled that he had acted with criminal intent and should be found guilty of her murder .

2016-06-13,"The first day of the hearing to determine what sentence Oscar Pistorius will receive for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp has concluded .
Here are the key developments .
Two witnesses will speak in mitigation
The defence says it will call two witnesses : the first , psychologist Professor Jonathan Scholtz , gave evidence today .
The second , so far unnamed , will speak about Pistoriusâ€ ™ charity work .
Scholtz :
Pistorius should not return to prison Scholtz said in his view Pistorius was â€œbrokenâ€ � and should be in hospital rather than prison .
Further imprisonment would have a detrimental effect on him .
[ It ] would not be psychologically or socially constructive .
Mr Pistorius would be better served â€ ¦ if he gave back in a positive and constructive way , using his skills .
The doctor said Pistoriusâ€ ™ depression , anxiety , paranoia and social phobia had worsened since his trial .
He has post - traumatic stress disorder but is not a psychopath .
Scholtz said Pistorius can not bear the sound of gunfire , even on television , and has sold all his firearms .
Pistorius will not testify Scholtz said did not believe Pistorius was fit to testify in this hearing : I donâ€ ™ t think he is able to be a witness in this trial : his condition is severe .
But chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel asked why Pistorius had then been able to give an interview to Britainâ€ ™ s
ITV , to be broadcast next week .
â€˜His risk of reoffending is lowâ€ ™
The former athlete has participated in courses on anger management and restorative justice , and the doctor believed his risk of violent reoffending was low .
But he was â€˜verbally violent and aggressiveâ€ ™ in prison Nel said a separate report by a prison psychologist found Pistorius was â€œverbally violent and aggressiveâ€ � towards staff .
Scholtz justified omitting this report from his own , saying it was a â€œpoor reportâ€ � and â€œunscientificâ€ � .
Barry Roux , for the defence , said an episode in which Pistorius banged a table came after he had been denied access to a painkilling drug , Voltaren , for three weeks .
There are conflicting versions of his time in prison
The prosecution argued that information in the psychological report about Pistorius being assaulted in prison and witnessing a hanging were untrue .
Scholtz rejected a prosecution claim that two antidepressant drugs â€ “ Molipaxin and Cipralex â€ “ found in Pistoriusâ€ ™ cell were â€œillegalâ€ � .
Pistorius â€˜accepts he murdered Steenkampâ€ ™ Nel pushed Scholtz to confirm if Pistorius now admitted intentionally firing into the door and the person behind it ( Pistorius had previously insisted it was an accident and/or self - defence ) :
Nel :
Did Mr Pistorius indicate to you that he intentionally shot at the door knowing there was a person in the bathroom ?
Scholtz :
Yes â€ ¦ Nel :
Thatâ€ ™ s the first version of him intentionally shooting at the person that weâ€ ™
ve had in this court .
Itâ€ ™ s not clear if the Steenkamps will testify
Nel has not yet revealed how many witnesses he will call , or who they will be .
Reports suggested Barry Steenkamp , Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s father , might appear in aggravation of sentence .
Nel said June Steenkamp had forgiven Pistorius , but â€œfor her sake , not for his sakeâ€ � .
Scholtz told the court Pistorius had paid the Steenkamps R6,500 a month because : This is the kind of person he is â€
¦
It was not seen by him as some kind of means to change anything â€ ¦
This is what he does : he helps .
The court resumes on Tuesday at 9.30am local time ( 7.30am GMT ) , when we expect to hear from the second witness for the defence ."
2016-06-13,"Oscar Pistorius is to learn this week how long he will spend in prison for the crime of murdering his girlfriend with four bullets fired through a closed toilet door .
A sentencing hearing at the high court in Pretoria in South Africa starts on Monday and is expected to be be the final chapter in an extraordinary story that attracted intense worldwide attention .
The 29-year - old Olympic and Paralympic sprinter , who has spent recent months under house arrest at his uncleâ€ ™ s luxurious home in the city , could be in jail by the end of the week , with the prospect of about 15 years or possibly more behind bars .
Pistorius won global fame and fortune when he reached the semi - finals of the 400 m at the 2012 Olympics .
A double amputee below the knee from 11 months old , Pistorius inspired millions around the world with his determination to reach the highest levels of sport .
His success attracted lucrative endorsement contracts and sponsorship deals from major brands .
But in February 2013 Pistorius fell spectacularly from grace when he killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp , a model and law graduate .
Initially found guilty only of culpable homicide , or manslaughter in British law , and sentenced to five years in prison , he was convicted of murder after an appeal by state prosecutors last year .
The former athlete has exhausted almost every legal option available to him .
â€œThere is the theoretical possibility that he could appeal a sentence but â€ ¦ an appeal would not generally be admitted unless [ the sentence ] is shockingly inappropriate , â€ � said David Unterhalter , a professor of law at the University of Cape Town and a leading advocate .
Tens of millions around the world followed the 2014 trial of Pistorius .
Almost every minute of more than 40 days of psychological drama , intense emotion , police procedural and legal argument was broadcast live on South African television , and massively amplified by social media .
In South Africa the interest in the killing and its aftermath bordered on the obsessive .
â€œPeople took time off work and watched the action .
Workplaces came to a standstill .
There were dedicated TV channels and ratings for anything else plummeted .
Day after day , week after week , it was on the front pages .
The story was just so compelling .
The guy was a national hero and worshipped , and he became a national villain , â€ � said Mondli Makhanya , a prominent South African journalist .
The killing and the trial also held a mirror to South Africa more than 20 years after the end of apartheid and the coming of democracy at a time of widespread disillusionment at a perceived failure to achieve the lofty goals of that time have not been achieved .
â€œIn the same way that [ Nelson ] Mandela was the symbol of the country in the glorious years of generosity and pragmatism and all those good things ,
Pistorius â€ ¦ was a national icon of whom everyone was proud .
His cataclysmic fall was a metaphor for broader disappointed dreams , â€ � said John Carlin , who attended the trial and is the author of a book on the former athlete .
Though one South African commentator described the country as â€œheartily sickâ€ � of the case , every twist and turn is still being picked over .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s family has responded angrily to a new book , published in April , claiming forensic evidence from the trial showed the athlete had attacked Steenkamp shortly before shooting her dead .
The family dismissed the book as the work of â€œamateur forensic hobbyistsâ€ � .
Days later came the news that ITV , the British network , would broadcast an interview with Pistorius , his first since the murder , in which he would speak about the night he murdered his girlfriend and be questioned about the case .
It will be screened later this month .
A feature - length film is also planned , as well as a three - part South African TV documentary based on a bestselling book about the murder .
Initially the prosecution had argued that Pistorius had deliberately killed his girlfriend out of jealousy and anger .
Pistorius , who frequently broke down in court , denied the accusation , saying he was deeply in love with her and believed he was protecting her when he shot through the toilet door because he thought an intruder was hiding there .
The trial judge found there was no evidence that Pistorius had wanted to kill Steenkamp but found him guilty of the lesser crime of culpable homicide , as he had acted â€œtoo hastily and used excessive forceâ€ � .
The verdict and sentence â€ “ five years in jail , of which only one would be served before the athlete was bailed â€
“
prompted outrage among campaigners against rape and domestic violence in South Africa and surprise among many legal experts .
The trial judge was criticised for failing to answer the key legal question of whether any reasonable person should have foreseen that firing so many bullets through a door was likely to cause death , whoever was thought to be on the other side .
The appeal court felt Pistorius must have known that he was likely to kill someone and overturned the manslaughter verdict .
Describing Steenkampâ€ ™ s death as â€œa tragedy of Shakespearean proportionsâ€ � , the appeal judges said the accused ought to have been found guilty of murder .
As Pistorius had already been released under house arrest at his uncleâ€ ™ s residence in October 2015 , before the stateâ€ ™ s successful appeal , he did not return to prison .
A subsequent attempt by Pistoriusâ€ ™ s legal team to appeal against the murder conviction was blocked in March by the constitutional court ,
South Africaâ€ ™ s highest judicial authority .
In the hearings this week the former athleteâ€ ™ s lawyers are likely to argue that his double amputation has made him psychological fragile , inducing a deep anxiety and a tendency to overreaction .
They are likely too to emphasise his work with charity in an effort to reduce the sentence .
The first trial revealed Pistoriusâ€ ™ s taste for guns and fast cars as well as his short temper .
â€œFor the prurient there will be a privileged view in his psychological makeup .
The defence will be looking to show that he is a paranoid personality prone to this kind of behaviour .
Now the issue is not whether is he guilty of murder the perspective is slightly different , â€ � said Unterhalter .
Prosecutors may call their own witnesses .
Steenkampâ€ ™ s father , Barry , could give evidence for the first time .
One further twist is that as the hearing this week is effectively a continuation of the original trial , the same judge will preside .
Thokozile Masipa , a 68-year - old former journalist who was only the second black woman to be appointed to the high court , was praised for her calm authority despite her controversial original verdict .
Observers say that , amid all the negative reflections on South Africa prompted by the Pistorius saga , one positive element has been the apparent strength of the countryâ€ ™ s justice system .
â€œThe South African justice system has come out of this very well .
The trial was conducted in an intelligent and mature way that was impressive by any world standards , â€ � said Carlin .
Makhanya said it was unlikely that Pistorius would be forgotten , even if jailed .
The Steenkamp family has made efforts to keep the public focused on the killing , as have campaigners against domestic violence and abuse .
â€œIt will be with us for a long time to come , â€ � Makhanya said .

2016-06-13,"Silent , head bowed , shoulders hunched in an ill - fitting suit , Oscar Pistorius would have attracted little attention from a casual observer unaware of his central role in the drama under way on Monday , in a nondescript ground floor courtroom in Pretoria .
Behind him sat members of his own family and that of Reeva Steenkamp , the model and law graduate he killed on Valentineâ€ ™ s Day 2013 , by firing four shots through a door in his home only a few miles away .
In front was his defence team , who hope this week to convince judge Thokozile Masipa , to be lenient , as well as the state prosecutors , there to demand the minimum 15-year prison sentence for the double - amputee Olympic runner , after his original manslaughter conviction was changed to murder .
After the break for lunch , Pistorius re - entered the courtroom alone , long before the court was due to reconvene .
Walking slowly , he appeared disorientated .
Sitting down he appeared to break down and was comforted by his sister Aimee .
Pistorius won global fame and fortune by reaching the semi finals of the 400 m sprint in the London Olympics of 2012 and landing a series of lucrative sponsorship deals with major brands .
The 29-year - old , whose lower legs were amputated when he was 11 months old was dubbed the â€œblade runnerâ€ � , a reference to the carbon fibre prosthetics he used to compete .
Now Pistorius is a â€œbroken manâ€ � suffering serious depression , who has â€œleft his fate up to Godâ€ � , Prof Jonathan Scholtz , a clinical psychologist called as an expert witness for the defence , told the court during the morning session .
Scholtz said he had seen a significant deterioration in the mental state of Pistorius since he had first examined him in 2014 .
â€œ[Then ] I saw two Oscars ...
One was this super - Olympian , very successful , who seemed totally in control and even physically tall with his prostheses .
Then there was the other [ Oscar ] without his prostheses who was a vulnerable , anxious man .
More recently I saw a third Oscar that really has almost given up .
His spirit seems broken .
I believe he is quite ill .
If he was my patient , I would admit him to hospital , â€ � Scholtz said .
The psychologist said the former athlete was suffering severe depression , as well as post traumatic stress syndrome , and was unfit to testify before the court .
First convicted for manslaughter in September 2014 , Pistorius received a sentence of five years .
He was released on bail after 10 months and has been living under effective house arrest at the luxurious Pretoria home of his uncle .
However , prosecutors appealed the verdict , which was upgraded to murder by South Africaâ€ ™ s supreme court .
Pistorius was denied permission to appeal against that decision .
Legal experts say it is extremely unlikely that the sportsman will be able to challenge the sentence he receives following this weekâ€
™ s hearing .
Scholtz told the court that Pistorius had suffered ill - health in prison , had overheard the rape of another inmate , who subsequently hanged himself , had been assaulted and had been kept in what amounted to solitary confinement .
However , in cross examination , Gerrie Nel , the leading state prosecutor , accused Scholtz of a lack of objectivity .
Nel , who is known for his belligerent style , said there was no official record of the incidents in prison that the former athlete had described and that he had in fact been permitted to leave his cell but had not wanted to do so .
The prosecutor also referred to reports of Pistorius being â€œverbally violentâ€ � with officials , which he said Scholtz had ignored , and said that the sportsman was depressed only because he â€œfelt sorry for himselfâ€ � .
Nel also questioned Scholtzâ€ ™ s assertion that Pistorius was not fit to testify , saying the former athlete had given a TV interview .
An hour - long interview with Britainâ€ ™ s
ITV is due to air later this month .
The trial continues to excite significant interest in South Africa , where it has provoked a fierce debate about violence and domestic abuse , and internationally .
Critics and supporters were both present in the trial , and outside the courtroom .
â€œA big sentence will send a message that we are not going to be allow men and women to kill each other .
As South Africans , we are sick and tired of this killing of women and kids , â€ � said Joyce Ramutloa , a 60-year - old pensioner from Mamelodi , a township on the outskirts of Pretoria .
Ramutloa , a member of the African National Congress Womenâ€ ™ s League said she had attended every hearing .
The organisation has been a vocal presence throughout the trial .
Nearby sat Lize Bester , a 45-year - old doctorâ€ ™
s receptionist from a small farming town in Mpumalangma province .
A member of an organisation called the International Supporters of Oscar Pistorius , she had driven 250 miles to the court .
â€œWe are praying for him .
We really hope justice will be done .
He did not receive a fair trial .
His human rights were abused , â€ � Bester said .
At the end of the dayâ€ ™ s hearing at 3.15pm , Pistorius shook off some of his apparent lethargy for the first time .
He embraced a supporter , refused a journalistâ€ ™ s request for an interview and then , flanked by security , left the courtroom .
The hearing continues on Tuesday .

2016-06-14,"Barry Steenkampâ€ ™ s evidence
The father of Reeva Steenkamp said he thought the world should see the photographs of her wounds , to see â€œthe pain she must have gone throughâ€ � .
He said he had pushed his diabetes needles into his own stomach and arms to try to feel it himself .
Steenkamp said he did not know his daughter was in a relationship with Pistorius .
He said he and his wife June had forgiven Pistorius because of their Christian faith .
But he added : Oscar has to pay for what he did .
He has to pay for it
â€
¦
That is up to the court .
And we will go by the decision that the court hands down to Oscar .
But he has to pay for his crime .
He said his wife had been depicted in some reports as a â€œstone - faced womanâ€ � :
But I hear her crying at night .
I hear her talking to Reeva .
She feels just as much as I do .
Steenkamp said he might one day want to speak to Pistorius about the death of his daughter .
Defence witnesses Ebba Gudny Gudmundsdottir , from Iceland , said Pistorius had become a close friend when she contacted him about her son , who was born without legs .
The then athlete had encouraged him when he struggled with his prostheses and gave him one of his gold medals .
Pastor Marius Nel said Pistorius was a member of his church and had volunteered to work with schools to help students with fitness and nutrition .
Pastor Nel said he visited Pistorius in prison and found him â€œa broken manâ€ � .
State witness Charlotte Mashabane Prison nurse Charlotte Mashabane testified to incidents in which she said Pistorius had been aggressive with her while serving his jail sentence , including one occasion when she went into his cell when he was asleep and he shouted at her to get out .
On another occasion she said he banged a table with a notebook when she did not give him the medication he wanted .
Barry Roux , for the defence , accused her of exaggerating her account to paint Pistorius in a negative light .
Dispute continues over whether antidepressants
â€ “ 28 molipaxin and 14 cipralex
â€ “ found in Pistoriusâ€ ™ cell were unauthorised ; and over an assault the defence alleges he suffered in prison and a hanging he witnessed .
The state says the last two did not happen .
What will happen on day three ?
Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel says he has one more witness who will give â€œemotional evidenceâ€ � .
The court resumes at 9.30am local time ( 7.30am GMT ) .
Thanks for reading .
This live blog will be back for Wednesdayâ€ ™ s hearing .
Nel says he has another , final witness to argue in aggravation of sentence but would like to complete that testimony in one day
â€ “ so would rather wait until tomorrow .
He says he does not want to take a chance of the evidence carrying overnight .
It will be emotional evidence , I donâ€ ™ t want to do that to the witness .
Roux objects .
Itâ€ ™ s a waste of time and not fair on Pistorius , he argues .
He doesnâ€
™ t know who the witness is , and accuses Nel of â€œa tacticâ€ � .
Nel : Iâ€ ™
m just doing the best I can for my witnesses
â€ ¦
My only concern is I donâ€ ™ t want to keep the witness overnight .
Judge Masipa allows Nelâ€ ™ s request but says the court must sit late tomorrow if this witness runs over time .
The court adjourns .
Iâ€ ™ ll post a summary shortly .
Roux has an intervention .
He says the final questioning implied that molipaxin and cipralex were not prescribed .
He says they were .
Nel agrees .
Nel picks up the drugs - in - cell theme .
Mr Roux wants to tell you that this accused was hoarding medicine prescribed for anxiety and depression .
Do you know how many tablets a day he was supposed to take ?
They calculate that he would have had to store drugs for a month without taking any to reach the number that was found in his cell .
And Nel now is also done .
Gerrie Nel begins his re - examination of prison nurse Charlotte Mashabane .
He turns to her incident report .
She reads from it about the occasion in which Pistorius was , she says â€œdisrespectfulâ€ � , angry and shaking , banging the table with a small book .
Roux says Pistorius did not report the attack to prison authorities but told his psychologist .
Mashabane says he had only one black eye .
She also disputes again the defence account of Pistorius seeing an inmate who had hanged himself .
There was a prisoner who killed himself , she says .
But they donâ€ ™ t
â€œleave a body hanging there
so everyone can see
itâ€ � .
How did he then know about it , Roux asks .
He might have heard about it from another inmate , she replies .
Roux is finished with his cross - examination .
Roux wants to know more about the medication found in Pistoriusâ€ ™ cell : molipaxin and cipralex .
Do staff supervise inmates taking each pill ?
Mashabane says they do not .
So he could carry his pills back to his cell , Roux asks .
You didnâ€ ™ t know whether he was actually taking them .
He did not have to drink it there and then .
Roux says he can cite other occasions when Pistorius was given prescribed medication for anxiety and told to take it when necessary .
Presumably Roux here is trying to puncture Nelâ€ ™
s claim that Pistorius had â€œillegalâ€ � or unauthorised drugs in his cell by arguing that he could have accumulated them legitimately .
Roux says Pistorius was trying to wean himself off anxiety medicine that made him drowsy .
After the emotional testimony of Barry Steenkamp this morning â€ “ and Rouxâ€ ™ s
understandably brief cross - examination â€ “ the defenceâ€ ™ s time spent on this witness is puzzling some court observers : Prison nurse Charlotte Mashabane , called by the state , is still on the stand .
Sheâ€ ™ s being cross - examined by Barry Roux for the defence .
My colleague Jason Burke has filed this report from the court in Pretoria : The father of Reeva Steenkamp has said he and his wife have forgiven Oscar Pistorius , but this did not mean he should not pay for his crime .
In emotional testimony before a crowded courtroom in Pretoria on the second day of Pistoriusâ€ ™ s sentencing hearing , Barry Steenkamp described how his family had been devastated by the killing .
â€œI think of her every day ; I talk to her .
It is difficult to explain .
What happened devastated us .
I wouldnâ€ ™ t wish that on anybody in the world , â€ � Steenkamp , 73 , said .
Many wept during the testimony .
Pistorius sat with his head bowed in his hands , crying openly .
Relatives of the former Paralympian were present in court , along with the Steenkamps .
In halting testimony , Steenkamp described the pain of bereavement .
â€œEver since Reevaâ€ ™ s death I have spent my time on my veranda , at two or three in the morning .
I smoke my cigarettes .
When I see feathers or something like that , I think Reeva would have liked that , â€ � he told the court .
â€œI think of Reeva every day , every day of my life , in the afternoon , in the night â€
¦ I talk to her every day in my head â€ ¦ my daughter.â€
� â€œWhat she must have gone through in those split seconds .
She must have been in so much fear and pain .
That is what I think of all the time .
I can see it myself .
It must have been absolutely and utterly awful , â€ � Steenkamp said .
Barry Roux , leading the defence team , did not cross - examine Steenkamp , saying only : â€œWe understand and we are very , very sorry .
Whatever we do and say it can not bring her back.â€
�
The judge says the court will take a half - hour break for lunch .
She addresses the courtroom .
We are not at a picnic , she says .
Sometimes witnesses say things that are funny , but she warns the gallery : Please restrain yourselves , we are in a court of law .
Prior to that incident , Pistorius was â€œa kind personâ€ � , Mashabane says .
Roux makes her repeat that .
Twice .
Judge Masipa intervenes .
You are tricking the witness , she tells him .
Roux pushes her : why would she feel threatened ?
In the incident in which she walked into his cell while he was sleeping , he was in his underpants , he says .
No , Mashabane tells him : he was under a blanket and pulled it over his head , speaking to her rudely .
Was he violent , Roux asks her .
No , she says : he just raised his voice .
Roux hands Mashabane a prison register .
Where on here does it say Pistorius was happy with the rub - rub , he wants to know .
Take your time , he tells her .
Roux : Iâ€
™ m still trying to understand the purpose of your evidence
â€
¦ Are you coming to tell the court that heâ€ ™ s a violent person ?
Mashabane : Iâ€ ™
m not coming to tell the court that heâ€ ™ s a violent-
Roux :
So I can exclude that ?
Mashabane :
He is actually , sometimes .
She says on those three occasions he threatened her .
Roux sounds incredulous : we could walk to a pharmacy now and get Voltaren , he tells her .
His hand was fractured and you would not let him have an x - ray , only â€œrub - rubâ€ � .
No , no , Mashabane replies .
It was an old injury .
The remedy she gave him assisted him .
She doesnâ€ ™ t know why Pistorius is changing his statement now .
Roux is picking apart Mashabaneâ€ ™ s description of the table - banging incident .
She says he was shaking and she stayed calm .
He banged his notebook on the table , she says .
Not his fist , Roux asks .
Because Nel yesterday said he was banging with his fist on the table .
And now itâ€ ™ s become a notebook .
So it was never with his fist .
Was what Pistorius was asking so bad , Roux wants to know .
The prison medication didnâ€ ™ t work â€
“
he simply wanted his own medication .
It was the attitude , Mashabane tells him .
He was angry .
He demanded medication that was not allowed .
She starts to talk about Pistorius â€œthrowing thingsâ€ � down on the table .
You didnâ€
™ t mention this previously , Roux says .
He accuses her of making it sound worse .
Why do I get the impression that you want to say something about him
thatâ€ ™ s negative because the two of you are not very compatible personalities ?
Roux asks why Pistorius did not shake her hand if she was so nice to him .
Roux clarifies that Mashabane interacted with Pistorius every day for about six months .
Nel turns to the evidence yesterday about Pistorius witnessing a hanging .
Mashabane says the ward in question was not visible from the hospital wing where Pistorius was held : Ward 4 is very far from where Mr Pistorius was staying .
She says the inmate hanged himself shortly after being taken to this ward .
Nelâ€ ™ s questioning is over now , and Roux is on his feet .
Mashabane says that in court Pistorius greeted all officials apart from her
It didnâ€
™ t worry me â€
¦
It is his choice .
Nel asks who would have had action to the wing where Pistorius was kept .
Mashabane says there is a security guard , and other inmates are not allowed in there .
Yesterday , the court was told by the defence witness that Pistorius was assaulted .
Mashabane says there was no report of that
and she would have known about it .
He did have a â€œblue eyeâ€ � ( black eye ) on one occasion , she says .
He slipped in the gym , she understands from the injury form .
Nel refers again to testimony yesterday , this time that his hand was injured when he banged on the table .
Mashabane says she had never heard of this .
Mashabane says that â€œafter several incidentsâ€ � with Pistorius , she was asked not to â€œinteract any moreâ€ � with him .
After that she never worked with him again , she tells the court .
Nel asks if Pistorius was taking antidepressant drugs molipaxin and cipralex .
Mashabane says he had these medications when he was admitted .
They should be kept by prison staff .
Nel asks why Pistorius had 28 molipaxin and 14 cipralex in his cell .
Mashabane says they would never have given him so many , and would only have given one day at a time .
Mashabane says that when a family member brings in a medication , it has to be cleared .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ family brought something for him in February 2015 , she says .
Her testimony is very detailed , but in brief , she says it was unclear who had arranged access to the medication .
Mashabane asked that the medication be given to her .
She locked it in her drug cupboard .
Pistorius came to her to ask for this medication .
She said no : it was not the procedure .
It was not on his prescription .
He started again with tantrums again .
Mashabane says Pistorius applied to be seen by his private doctor , Dr Van Wyk .
She rang this doctor herself , she tells the court , and then drove to speak to her .
She tells the court she did not want to slow down the process .
Nel asks if Van Wyk told her that she was Pistoriusâ€ ™ cousin .
Mashabane says she did not .
Nel says the doctor was newly qualified .
But she was approved to visit him .
Mashabane says she was approved even though she worked in a government hospital and would not normally be allowed to practise privately as well .
This is perhaps two separate confrontations ; we have now moved to the table - banging episode .
Mashabane is now talking about another occasion when she was told Pistorius was looking for her .
He wanted a supplement and a device that were not prescribed , she says , and the prison doctor was unfamiliar with it .
Mashabane says she googled the device and wrote a memo for the doctor .
The problem was the process , she goes on .
It is not something that can be approved in two days .
Pistorius came looking for her , she says .
He banged on the table , she adds .
He was holding a notebook and used it to bang close to where she was sitting .
Mashabane says Pistorius told her the doctor was â€œuselessâ€ � and that she herself was â€œnot competentâ€
�
, she tells the court .
Mashabane is asked about the confrontation mentioned in court yesterday â€ “ when Pistorius reportedly banged on a table in front of her .
She confirms there was a confrontation during her morning rounds .
He shouted and screamed at her , she says : He said , get out , get out , I am still sleeping .
This was on 1 March 2015 , she confirms .
Mashabane said she was involved in admitting Pistorius to prison .
He was accommodated in the hospital wing that held only two people .
It had two cells and a gym , she says .
We will now hear from prison nurse Charlotte Mashabane .
She was mentioned during the cross - examination yesterday of defence witness Prof Scholtz .
The father of Reeva Steenkamp has given emotional testimony about the loss of his daughter , saying Oscar Pistorius must â€œpay the priceâ€ � for killing her .
Barry Steenkamp said he thought the world should see the photographs of Reevaâ€ ™ s wounds , to see what was inflicted upon her â€œand the pain she must have gone
throughâ€ � .
He said he had pushed his diabetes needles into his own stomach and arms to try to feel some of the pain she must have felt .
Steenkamp said he did not know his daughter was in a relationship with Pistorius , but that she would have told him when the â€œtime was rightâ€ � .
She would ring her parents every weekend , he told the court .
He spoke of how he and his wife June had forgiven the man who killed their daughter because of their Christian faith and to enable them to move on with their lives .
But he added : Oscar has to pay for what he did .
He has to pay for it
â€
¦
That is up to the court .
And we will go by the decision that the court hands down to Oscar .
But he has to pay for his crime .
I donâ€
™ t want to say that he has to go to the maximum â€
¦
But he has to pay for it .
He said his wife had been depicted in some reports as a â€œstone - faced womanâ€ � :
But I hear her crying at night .
I hear her talking to Reeva .
She feels just as much as I do .
Steenkamp said he had declined attempts by Pistorius to make contact , but that he might one day want to speak to the former athlete about the events that led to the death of his daughter .
And he told the court he believed there had been an argument between the couple on the night she died â€ “ though this point was interrupted by the prosecutor , Gerrie Nel .
Steenkamp said his familyâ€ ™ s lives had â€œchanged completelyâ€ � since her murder .
He had a stroke and has suffered heart problems .
He and June were asked to leave their home two weeks after Reevaâ€ ™ s death after their landlord read about his financial difficulties in media reports .
Roux has no more questions for Barry Steenkamp .
Nel has one more issue to address .
He mentions the testimony of Dr Scholtz yesterday , who said the Steenkamp family have forgiven Pistorius .
Steenkamp says his wife June is a Christian
She feels itâ€ ™ s right in her heart to forgive Oscar â€
¦
It still does not exonerate you for the crime that you committed .
He must still understand that he has to pay for that .
June has forgiven him so that she can carry on with her life .
He says it has been difficult for him to forgive .
But I feel the same , that Oscar has to pay for what he did .
He has to pay for it
â€
¦
That is up to the court .
And we will go by the decision that the court hands down to Oscar .
But he has to pay from his crime .
I donâ€
™ t want to say that he has to go to the maximum â€
¦
But he has to pay for it .
Nel has finished .
Barry Roux for the defence begins by saying he is â€œvery , very sorryâ€ � for the loss of Reeva .
He can not bring her back .
He asks about the â€œmanyâ€ � efforts Pistorius made to contact the family but they declined .
If you were in my position , you might understand , Steenkamp tells him .
In tears , he adds that in future , he would like to talk to Pistorius .
Roux tells him that can happen when he is ready .
He says his wife June has been depicted as a â€œstone - faced womanâ€ � :
But I hear her crying at night .
I hear her talking to Reeva .
She feels just as much as I do.â€ � Steenkamp says the only photograph he has seen of his daughter was the one shown to the court .
A lot of people will disagree with me and think that Iâ€ ™ m callous â€ ¦
But what I would like the world to see are the wounds inflicted on to Reeva and the pain she must have gone through , so the world can see this .
Turning to the relationship between Reeva Steenkamp and Pistorius , her father says he didnâ€ ™ t know about it , adding that she would have told him when the â€œtime was rightâ€ � .
He says he and his wife have not had any direct contact with Pistorius .
On the R6,500 per month paid by Pistorius to the Steenkamps , he says that was arranged by legal teams .
We were in dire financial straits , he says .
The payments were supposed to be private and confidential but were brought up in court by the defence : I was disgusted by that .
The family declined further offers of money , he says .
Itâ€ ™ s my daughter
thatâ€ ™ s gone .
Itâ€ ™ s not the money .
Steenkamp says almost every week , Reeva would call to speak to her parents .
Christmas and birthdays are particularly difficult for the family , he goes on .
We would sit down and one chair would be there for Reeva .
Nel asks him about the night of the murder .
I personally think there was an argument .
Nel gently stops him .
He asks about Reeva : What she must have gone through in those split seconds .
She must have been in so much fear and pain .
That is what I think of all the time .
I can see it myself .
It must have been absolutely and utterly awful .
He says he used to jab the needles he uses for his diabetes into his stomach and his arms to see if he could feel the pain Reeva felt : â€œBut no.â€ � Steenkamp says he rang his brother â€ “ he says itâ€ ™ s â€œlike
Mr Pistorius : he can confide in his brotherâ€ � .
He turns to the day of the murder .
He was at work when his wife June rang him .
He couldnâ€
™
t understand , she was â€œscreaming and shoutingâ€ � .
He raced home and on his way he realised : She had mentioned Reeva â€ ¦ Driving home , I realised , Reevaâ€ ™ s been killed .
It hit me then .
Itâ€ ™ s like it happened yesterday .
Steenkamp says Reeva had worked as a model but also wanted to return to the law ( in which she had a degree ) and look after her parents .
He talks about how proud he and his wife were of their daughter : We were completely and utterly proud of her .
Nel asks Steenkamp about the wider family .
He has a son from a previous relationship and his wife June has a daughter , also from an earlier partnership .
Reeva was their only child together and the only one still living with them .
He says in 2013 they were in financial difficulty .
When Reeva died , he says , the landlady found out from media reports that he was virtually bankrupt .
Within two weeks of the murder , the family were given notice , he says .
They had to leave their home .
Nel asks him about the murder .
From that day , itâ€ ™ s affected June and my family
so much â€ ¦
Our lives have just changed completely .
Itâ€ ™ s very difficult to explain it â€
¦
I donâ€
™ t wish that on any human being .
Finding out what happened , it devastated us .
I ended up having a stroke .
I donâ€
™ t wish that on anybody in the whole world .
He says he has had heart problems since his daughter was killed .
I have changed completely , Steenkamp tells the court .
He says he can not mix with people any more .
He sits outside late into the night by himself .
He says he gets messages from â€œpeople who support usâ€ �
â€ “ perhaps a couple of hundred every day .
Steenkamp says he thinks of Reeva
Every day of my life â€ “ morning , noon , night â€
¦ I think of her all the time .
He is in tears .
Nel tells him he can stop at any time .
Steenkamp says the family has photos of Reeva â€œall over our houseâ€ � .
He talks to her every day .
He says people told him after two or three years he would start to feel a little better : But every day of my life is the same .
Steenkamp confirms he is the father of Reeva Steenkamp .
Nel asks him about evidence previously given in court by Kim Martin , his niece , with his blessing .
I couldnâ€ ™ t give evidence at the time
, Steenkamp says : I took a bad turn and I was advised by my doctor not to travel up to Pretoria .
Now , he says : I must give evidence .
Barry Steenkamp is sworn in as the first witness for the state in aggravation of sentence .
Barry Steenkamp has taken his place in the witness box .
We are waiting for the judge to return .
This will be a key moment in the hearing .
Barry Steenkamp has so far not spoken in court about the death of his daughter Reeva .
He was unable to attend large stretches of the original trial because he was so unwell , and instead watched it unfold on television at home .
The Sunday Telegraph reported that Steenkamp wanted to take the stand , citing a source saying : He is very fragile but he wants to do it .
If he can , it will be very powerful and emotional testimony .
Roux says he doesnâ€ ™ t know if he needs to call further witnesses because he doesnâ€ ™ t know the state witnesses and he might need to call someone to rebut .
For now he has no further witnesses .
Gerrie Nel says the stateâ€ ™ s first witness will be Barry Steenkamp , the father of Reeva Steenkamp .
He asks for another break to prepare the witness .
Gerrie Nel asks Marius Nel how often he saw Pistorius in prison .
The pastor says he was able to see him weekly .
Gerrie Nel has no further questions .
No re - examination from Roux .
The second witness of the day is finished .
Judge Masipa is back in the courtroom and the hearing resumes .
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel now has his chance to cross - examine defence witness and pastor Marius Nel .
Gerrie Nel :
Itâ€ ™ s kind of strange to address the witness as Mr Nel .
During the break , Oscar Pistorius turns round to talk to his uncle Arnold Pistorius and aunt Lois Pistorius who are , as usual , on the bench behind him .
His brother Carl Pistorius is also in court .
Marius Nel says he would prefer not to reveal in open court the names of the schools Pistorius worked with but can provide them to the judge .
Roux is finished with his questioning .
Gerrie Nel asks for a 15-minute break .
The pastor says he visited Pistorius â€œoftenâ€ � while he was in prison to provide spiritual care and comfort .
I experienced â€ ¦ a man that was broken , who expressed his sorrow .
I ministered to Mr Pistorius , prayed with him â€ ¦ and supported him .
Marius Nel says Pistorius is a member of his church .
Schools were interested in fitness , skills and nutrition and Pistorius was â€œvery excited and positive about thatâ€ � .
The feedback from the schools were very positive â€ ¦
They would appreciate his involvement and it would have a great effect in the school .
Marius Nel is a pastor in a church in Centurion , which runs a non - profit organisation called Bright Smiles , Bright Future focused on underprivileged children .
He says the group works with the education department to reach out to underprivileged learners in an â€œadopt a scholarâ€ � programme , providing blankets , stationery and so on .
There is also a feeding scheme for 5,000 children each day , and a medical programme .
It looks as if we will get a third witness for the defence in mitigation of sentence .
This is Marius Nel , a pastor .
( I will try to avoid confusion with the prosecutor by calling him Marius Nel , rather than simply Nel . )
Marius Nel asks not to be televised .
Roux says he has no further questions for Gudmundsdottir .
Gerrie Nel has only one : he wants to know how old her son is now .
He is 11 .
The witness is excused .
Gudmundsdottir says her family travelled to Manchester to see Pistorius running and it was â€œan inspirationâ€ � for her son , who at that time was struggling with his own prostheses .
Pistorius gave her son his gold medal , saying : This is for you , champion .
Pistorius told her it â€œwould be his pleasure to help us in any wayâ€ � , Gudmundsdottir says .
She says Pistorius wrote to her when her son was around seven months old to say he was coming to Iceland and did they want to meet him .
We were of course very , very happy .
Pistorius travelled frequently to Iceland because the company that made his blades ( prostheses ) was based there .
He took a special interest in her son , she says , but also in her older daughter , who is not disabled .
He made sure she was never left out .
Gudmundsdottir tells the court that when she was pregnant , she found out her son would be born without legs .
He was the first person to be born without legs in Iceland .
She says she Googled and came across footage of Pistorius running .
She contacted him .
Defence counsel Barry Roux calls his witness , Ebba Gudny Gudmundsdottir .
She is apparently a longstanding friend of Pistorius and is from Iceland .
Judge Thokozile Masipa has arrived and the hearing starts .
Today we expect to hear from the second defence witness â€ “
so far unnamed â€ “ who will testify about Pistoriusâ€ ™ work for charity .
Two witnesses will speak in mitigation
The defence will call two witnesses .
Psychologist Professor Jonathan Scholtz gave evidence on Monday .
The second , so far unnamed , will speak about Pistoriusâ€ ™ charity work .
Scholtz :
Pistorius should not return to prison Scholtz said Pistorius was â€œbrokenâ€ � and should be in hospital :
Further imprisonment would have a detrimental effect on him .
[ It ] would not be psychologically or socially constructive .
Mr Pistorius would be better served â€ ¦ if he gave back in a positive and constructive way , using his skills .
The doctor said Pistoriusâ€ ™ depression , anxiety , paranoia and social phobia had worsened since his trial .
He has post - traumatic stress disorder but is not a psychopath .
Scholtz said Pistorius can not bear the sound of gunfire , even on television , and has sold all his firearms .
He has taken courses on anger management and restorative justice , and Scholtz believed his risk of violent reoffending was low .
Pistorius will not testify Scholtz :
I donâ€ ™ t think he is able to be a witness in this trial : his condition is severe .
Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel asked why Pistorius had then been able to give an interview to Britainâ€ ™ s
ITV , to be broadcast next week .
He was â€˜verbally violent and aggressiveâ€ ™ in prison Nel said a separate report by a prison psychologist found Pistorius was â€œverbally violent and aggressiveâ€ � towards staff .
Scholtz justified omitting these findings , saying it was a â€œpoor reportâ€ � and â€œunscientificâ€ � .
Barry Roux , for the defence , said an episode in which Pistorius banged a table came after he had been denied access to a painkilling drug , Voltaren , for three weeks .
Pistorius â€˜accepts he murdered Steenkampâ€ ™ Nel asked Scholtz if Pistorius admitted he was guilty of murder :
Nel :
Did Mr Pistorius indicate to you that he intentionally shot at the door knowing there was a person in the bathroom ?
Scholtz :
Yes â€ ¦ Nel :
Thatâ€ ™ s the first version of him intentionally shooting at the person that weâ€ ™
ve had in this court .
Itâ€ ™ s not clear if the Steenkamps will testify
Nel has not yet revealed how many witnesses he will call , or who they will be .
Reports suggested Barry Steenkamp , Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s father , might appear in aggravation of sentence .
Today the high court in Pretoria reconvenes for the second day of the sentencing hearing for Oscar Pistorius .
The former athlete will receive a fresh sentence after his initial conviction for culpable homicide â€ “ for which he was given a five - year prison term â€ “ was overturned by South Africaâ€ ™ s supreme court , which found him guilty of murder .
Pistorius killed Reeva Steenkamp , his girlfriend , in February 2013 when he fired four bullets through a locked toilet cubicle door in his Pretoria home .
He served 10 months of his original jail sentence and since October 2015 has been living under house arrest conditions at his uncleâ€ ™ s home .
Yesterday the defence put forward its first witness , Professor Jonathan Scholtz , a clinical psychologist who testified that Pistorius was â€œbrokenâ€ � and should be in hospital rather than facing more prison time .
Iâ€ ™ ll post a summary of Scholtzâ€ ™ s evidence shortly .

2016-06-14,"The father of Reeva Steenkamp told a crowded courtroom on Tuesday that although he had forgiven Oscar Pistorius , who was convicted of his daughterâ€ ™ s 2013 murder , the former athlete should pay for what he has done .
In emotional testimony in the Gauteng high court in Pretoria on the second day of a sentencing hearing , Barry Steenkamp described how his family had been devastated by the killing of the law graduate and model .
â€œI think of her every day .
I talk to her .
It is difficult to explain .
What happened devastated us .
I wouldnâ€ ™ t wish that on anybody in the world , â€ � Steenkamp , 73 , said .
Many wept during the testimony .
Pistorius , who faces up to 15 years in prison , sat with his head in his hands , crying .
Relatives of the disgraced athlete were present in court , along with the Steenkamp family .
Pistorius won global fame and fortune as a Paralympic athlete and became the first double - leg amputee to participate in the Olympics , reaching the semi finals of the 400 m sprint in London 2012 .
He landed a series of lucrative sponsorship deals with major brands , and was branded the â€œblade runnerâ€ � , a reference to the carbon fibre prosthetics he used to compete .
But the fairytale ended when the 29-year - old , whose lower legs were amputated when he was 11 months old , shot dead his girlfriend on 14 February 2013 , claiming he thought she was an intruder .
The case has gripped south Africa and prompted intense global interest .
Pistorius was convicted of manslaughter in 2014 but the conviction was upgraded to murder last year after an appeal by state prosecutors .
The minimum sentence for murder in South Africa is 15 years , however legal experts say Judge Thokozile Masipa has considerable powers of discretion .
With his hands shaking and voice trembling , Steenkamp described the moment he learned of his daughterâ€ ™ s death and the intense pain of bereavement .
â€œEver since Reevaâ€ ™ s death I have spent my time on my veranda , at two or three in the morning .
I smoke my cigarettes .
I think of Reeva every day , every day of my life , morning , noon and night ...
I talk to hear every day in my head â€ ¦ my daughter , â€ � he told the court .
Steenkamp , a horse trainer , said he had pushed his diabetes needles into his own stomach and arms to try to feel some of the pain she must have felt .
Earlier in the day , Ebba GuÃ ° mundsdÃ³ttir , a celebrity chef and author from Iceland , described how Pistorius had become a family friend after he heard her son suffered the same disability .
The athlete had reached out to GuÃ ° mundsdÃ³ttir after being told of the boyâ€ ™ s condition by a journalist in contact with her mother and had visited the family frequently .
She described how , having won a gold medal in Manchester , Pistorius ran into the crowd to hang it around her sonâ€ ™ s neck .
â€œIt was a very lovely gesture , â€ � GuÃ ° mundsdÃ³ttir said .
Much of the legal argument around the killing has centred on whether Pistorius knew his girlfriend , who was 29 when she died , was in the toilet when he opened fire through the door .
The former athlete has repeatedly said he thought an intruder who had broken into the home was hiding in the cubicle .
Barry Steenkamp described his daughterâ€ ™ s plans to look after her parents in their old age when she returned to practise law after her a modelling career .
He was not aware of her relationship with Pistorius , though he spoke to his daughter weekly .
Asked to describe the events of the night of the killing , Steenkamp said â€œhe thought there was an argumentâ€ � before being gently stopped by leading prosecution lawyer Gerrie Nel .
â€œWhat she must have gone through in those split seconds .
She must have been in so much fear and pain .
That is what I think of all the time .
I can see it myself .
It must have been absolutely and utterly awful , â€ � Steenkamp said .
Barry Roux , leading the defence team of Pistorius , did not question Steenkamp , saying only : â€œWe understand and we are very , very sorry .
Whatever we do and say it can not bring her back.â€
�
Steenkamp explained that he had felt unable to accept previous requests from Pistorius to meet or talk .
Addressing the former athlete directly , he said that the â€œtime would comeâ€
� .
â€œI would like to talk to you , Oscar .
But not now , not here .
I would like to talk to you , â€ � he said .
When he was convicted for manslaughter , Pistorius received a sentence of five years .
He was released on bail after 10 months and has been living under effective house arrest at the luxurious Pretoria home of his uncle .
Legal experts say it is extremely unlikely that the former sportsman will be able to challenge the sentence he receives following this weekâ€ ™ s hearing .
But he might be able to apply for medical parole , once sentenced .
On Monday , the court heard from a psychologist who said Pistorius was suffering serious depression , anxiety and post - traumatic stress syndrome .
â€œHis spirit is broken .
If he was my patient I would admit him to hospital , â€ �
Prof Jonathan Scholtz said .
But prosecutor Nel said Pistorius has shown no remorse for killing Steenkamp and was depressed because he felt sorry for himself .
Charlotte Mashabane , an assistant health manager at the prison where Pistorius was held for a year , told the court on Tuesday
he â€œthrew tantrumsâ€ � while in prison
and she felt threatened by him .
Steenkamp said on Tuesday that , as Christians , he and his wife June , who was in court , had forgiven Pistorius .
â€œFor me
it has been difficult to forgive , but I feel that Oscar ... has to pay .
We will go by the decision that the court hands down to Oscar .
I donâ€
™ t want to say that he has to go to the maximum â€
¦
But he has to pay for it , â€ � he said .
The hearing , set for four days , continues ."
2016-06-15,"Oscar Pistorius , the South African Paralympic and Olympic athlete , removed the prostheses he uses for walking and running in court on Wednesday in an effort to avoid a heavy jail sentence for killing his girlfriend with four shots from a 9 mm handgun fired through a closed toilet door .
Pistorius , whose lower legs were amputated when he was 11 months old , removed his prostheses and made his way unsteadily across the courtroom .
On the third day of a sentencing hearing in the Gauteng high court in Pretoria , Barry Roux , who leads the former athleteâ€ ™ s defence team , said they wanted to show the court that Pistorius was not a â€œstrong , ambitious man winning gold medalsâ€
� .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t want to overplay vulnerability â€ ¦
I donâ€ ™ t want to overplay disability â€
¦
It doesnâ€
™ t mean because heâ€ ™ s vulnerable that he can do what he likes .
But please letâ€ ™ s understand â€ ¦ who is this man that you must sentence?â€ � Roux said .
The state prosecutor Gerry Nel told the trial judge Thokozile Masipa that it was her duty to impose at least the 15 years prescribed as a minimum sentence for murder in South Africa â€œdespite any personal doubtsâ€
� she might have .
Pistorius was released on bail last year after serving 10 months of a five - year sentence for culpable homicide , the equivalent of manslaughter in English law .
His conviction was subsequently upgraded to murder by the supreme court of appeal .
Masipa will now sentence the former athlete for the more serious crime .
Nel said any sentence needed to consider the needs of the community and send a strong message to deter violent crime .
South Africa has some of the highest levels of murder in the world .
â€œI can not think of a more excessive use of a firearm than â€ ¦ .
firing four shots through that doorway , â€ � said Nel , whose belligerent style has attracted both praise and criticism .
â€œMurder remains the most reprehensible crime â€ ¦ Society demands that appropriate sentences be imposed .
We argue for long - term imprisonment.â€ � Pistorius won global fame and fortune by reaching the semi - finals of the 400 m sprint in the London Olympics of 2012 and landing a series of lucrative sponsorship deals with major brands .
The 29-year - old was nicknamed the â€œblade runnerâ€ � , a reference to the carbon fibre prosthetics he used to compete , and hailed as a role model for disabled people all over the world .
He killed Reeva Steenkamp , a law graduate and model , in the early hours of 14 February 2013 at his home in Pretoria .
The subsequent trial showed a darker side to the athlete , revealing a taste for guns and fast cars .
Pistorius remained slumped with his head in his hands through much of Wednesdayâ€ ™ s hearings .
The case has gripped South Africa and prompted fierce global interest .
Relatives of both Pistorius and Steenkamp have attended the court , sitting within metres of each other .
Both sides have sought to sway Masipa with hours of legal arguments and testimony which have seen moments of intense emotion .
On Tuesday , the father of the victim wept as he told the court said that though , with great difficulty , he had forgiven Pistorius , the former athlete should â€œpayâ€ � for what he had done .
In emotional testimony , Barry Steenkamp described how his family had been devastated by the murder .
â€œI think of her every day .
I talk to her .
It is difficult to explain .
What happened devastated us .
I wouldnâ€ ™ t wish that on anybody in the world , â€ � Steenkamp , 73 , said .
Nel told the court on Wednesday that â€œforgiveness has more to do with the person who is forgiving than the person who committed the crimeâ€ � .
â€œThere is still that need for a sentence according to the crime that is committed , â€ � Nel said .
Earlier in the week , the court heard from a psychologist who said Pistorius was suffering serious depression , anxiety and post - traumatic stress syndrome .
Roux , appearing for Pistorius , told the court on Wednesday
that the former athlete had already â€œpunished himselfâ€ �
. â€œ[He ] will punish himself for the rest of his life far more than any court of law can punish him .
He paid from the moment he fired the shot .
He has lost his future , losing his loved one .
He is a broken man .
He has paid financially .
He has paid socially â€ ¦
He is filled with self - loathing .
He has paid constantly , â€ � Roux said .
State prosecutors initially accused Pistorius of killing his girlfriend in a fit of jealous rage after an argument at his luxurious home in a gated community in Pretoria .
Roux said this â€œincorrect versionâ€ � had been rejected during the trial and should not be allowed to influence any sentence .
â€œThe accused never intended to kill the deceased , â€ � he told the court .
Much of the legal argument around the killing has centred on whether Pistorius should have foreseen the likelihood of the death of whoever was in the cubicle when he opened fire .
The former athlete has repeatedly said he thought an intruder had broken into the home and was hiding there .
Nel successfully applied for the removal of a court ban imposed on the publication of graphic images of the wounds inflicted on Steenkamp .
He also said that an interview given by Pistorius to ITV , the British television network , due to be broadcast after legal proceedings end , was â€œdisrespectfulâ€ � .
Legal experts say it is extremely unlikely that the former sportsman will be able to challenge the sentence he receives following this weekâ€
™ s hearing .
He might however be able to apply for medical parole , once sentenced .
Masipa said she would announce the sentence next month ."
2016-06-15,"Sentencing will take place on 6 July Judge Thokozile Masipa said the court would reconvene on Wednesday 6 July for her to hand down sentence .
Masipa also allowed an application by chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel , backed by the Steenkamp family , to publish photos of Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s injuries .
Nel : Isnâ€ ™ t it time
we now finally let the world see what this accused did with four black talon rounds through a door ?
Defence : â€˜no purpose servedâ€ ™ in sending Pistorius to prison
In a moment of high drama , and with many people in court in tears , Oscar Pistorius took off his prostheses and walked across the room , grabbing a desk for support .
Defence counsel Barry Roux told the judge : I donâ€ ™ t want to overplay vulnerability â€ ¦
I donâ€ ™ t want to overplay disability â€
¦
It doesnâ€
™ t mean because heâ€ ™ s vulnerable that he can do what he likes .
Thatâ€ ™ s not what we say .
But when weâ€ ™ re entering the field of sentencing , look at that manâ€ ™ s conduct â€ ¦
Please letâ€
™ s understand â€ ¦ who is this man that you must sentence ?
â€œThere is no purpose servedâ€
� by sending Pistorius back to prison , Roux argued , and he should instead perform community service : Punishment is not meant to break the defendant â€ ¦
The accused does not fall into the category of offender who should be removed from society .
Roux said there were â€œserious enemiesâ€ � in the case , including the widely - held perception that Pistorius had intended to kill Steenkamp , and the unwillingness of many people to take into account the circumstances : It was not the man winning gold medals that must be judged â€ ¦
It was a 1.5-metre person , standing on his stumps , three oâ€ ™ clock in the morning when it was dark .
The defence cited the case of rugby player Vleis Visagie , who accidentally killed his daughter and was not prosecuted : How must you feel when you fire those shots that you should not have , and itâ€ ™ s your own girlfriend ?
The facts of the case were not set aside by the supreme court , which upgraded the conviction to murder on a legal point , Roux said .
The original five - year sentence relied on those same facts : he was anxious , vulnerable and afraid ; he did not intend to kill Steenkamp .
The decision to broadcast the trial had not benefitted Pistorius , Roux said : No other accused has ever had to endure this level of publicity , misinformation and character assassination .
State : â€˜15 years in prison is the minimumâ€ ™ Gerrie Nel , for the state , said the judge had no choice under the law but to start with a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison .
It was not plausible to argue that Pistorius was remorseful when he still has â€œno acceptable explanationâ€
� for why he acted as he did , Nel said .
Nel said that while the defence talked about Pistoriusâ€ ™ suffering , Reeva Steenkamp â€œdisappearedâ€ � .
She is just as important as the personal circumstances of the accused â€ ¦
She can never walk in court .
Nel said the â€œbroken manâ€ � in the courtroom was not Pistorius but Barry Steenkamp , Reevaâ€ ™ s father , and that his decision to forgive his daughterâ€ ™ s killer was not a reason for leniency : Forgiveness has more to do with the person forgiving than with the crime .
Nel said it was â€œdisrespectful to the court , to the victims of this crime , to the deceasedâ€ � that Pistorius had chosen to give an interview to ITV , to be broadcast next week .
The final witness First the court heard from Kim Martin , cousin of Reeva Steenkamp .
She said her family would not get over the killing , and said Pistoriusâ€ ™ decision to give an interview to Britainâ€ ™ s ITV channel was â€œhurtfulâ€ � :
People say we got the truth , but we didnâ€ ™ t .
Oscarâ€ ™
s
version changed so many times â€
¦
He never apologised for shooting Reeva .
I donâ€
™ t feel the truth came out .
The live blog will return on 6 July for sentencing .
Thank you for reading .
Masipa says he will hand down her sentence on Thursday 7 July .
Roux says he will not be available on that date .
It moves to Wednesday 6 July .
Pistorius remains on bail until then .
Masipa says she will deal first with the application to release the photos of Steenkampâ€ ™ s injuries .
She says it was the state who asked for them to be withheld in the first place .
As a result , she does not think there needs to be a separate application , as the same party â€ “ that is , the state â€ “ is making the case to make them public now .
She allows the request .
While we wait for the judge to return , some insight on why Oscar Pistorius decided to give an interview to ITV , which will be broadcast next week .
It prompted criticism from Gerrie Nel in court , as the prosecutor accused him of giving his version of what happened on the night he killed Reeva Steenkamp to a TV channel and not to the court : The statement , from Pistoriusâ€ ™ uncle Arnold Pistorius , explains : We have been deeply respectful of the legal process and mindful not to contribute to the media frenzy that has characterised this case .
We declined almost all requests for interviews and comment â€ ¦ Despite the many , many requests for interviews with Oscar from across the globe â€ “ often coupled with huge financial inducements â€ “ we have been absolutely consistent in our position that there would be no interview , or media engagement , for Oscarâ€ ™ s financial benefit â€ ¦
Neither Oscar nor the Pistorius family will make any money out of this documentary â€ ¦
Not knowing what the future holds for Oscar after this week , I decided it was necessary to take up one media offer that would provide our family with a voice
â€
¦
I wish to make it very clear that this engagement with ITV was my decision , and not Oscarâ€ ™ s initiative .
Judge Masipa says she will retire now to think about the application on the photographs and to decide a date for sentencing .
The court breaks .
Roux has finished .
Nel returns to the topic of the application to release the photos of Steenkamp .
Nel says the court can agree that the photos can only be shown in court , or made available to the media .
They are exhibits and so public documents .
They were not made public only to â€œprotect the integrity of the deceasedâ€ � .
But now , he says , itâ€ ™ s the view of the Steenkamp family that the images ought to be released : They have to bear the consequences
â€
¦
We think itâ€ ™ s time that people should see what those bullets did ; what the accused did .
Barry Roux now turns to his rebuttal of the stateâ€ ™ s closing argument .
He says Barry Steenkamp repeated in his evidence that he still believes there was an argument between his daughter and Pistorius on the night she was killed .
Roux says the stateâ€ ™ s decision to pursue a case based on an assumption that Pistorius deliberately killed her has exacerbated the familyâ€ ™ s distress .
Nel asks the judge if she will rule today on the release of the Steenkamp injury photographs .
Masipa says this would be extending the scope of these proceedings
â€ “ we are here for sentencing .
The witness , Barry Steenkamp , testified in these proceedings , Nel says .
The court should have access to these photographs .
The court itself should revisit certain things in sentencing â€ ¦ Four bullets tore through her body .
The court should take that into account as an aggravating factor â€ ¦ Itâ€ ™ s part of sentencing .
Roux speaks now .
He says it should be a separate application that would need separate submissions .
This isnâ€ ™ t the appropriate stage , he says .
Must children look at it ?
â€
¦
What is going to be achieved ?
Nel says Barry Steenkamp did not display anger or hatred towards Pistorius , only grief .
He said he should pay for his crime , but not that he must be â€œsent away for everâ€ � .
Nel asks Judge Masipa to lift the order banning the publication of crime scene photographs of Reeva Steenkamp , as requested by her father in his testimony yesterday .
Barry Steenkamp said he wanted the world to see the wounds inflicted on her and the pain she must have felt .
Carl Pistorius , the defendantâ€ ™ s brother , who is in court , has tweeted to say the move is â€œdistastefulâ€ � .
Nel says the state argues for long - term imprisonment and 15 years should be the minimum .
Nel says the finding that Pistorius did not specifically intend to kill Steenkamp is not a mitigating factor .
He says if an offender sets off a bomb that kills 50 people , it does not matter that he does not know the identities of those 50 people .
He is guilty of the murder of Reeva .
He killed her .
Believing he was shooting at an intruder is not a mitigating factor , Nel insists : The identity of the victim is irrelevant to his guilt and irrelevant to sentence .
It is fair for the court to take the accusedâ€ ™
s
personal circumstances into account , Nel says .
But in this case , this â€œrecedes into the backgroundâ€ � compared with the seriousness of the offence .
Reeva Steenkamp â€œdisappearedâ€ � in this trial , he says .
The court should take into account â€œwho she was â€ ¦ what dreams
she hadâ€
� .
She is just as important as the personal circumstances of the accused â€ ¦
She can never walk in court .
It doesnâ€
™ t matter if Pistorius thought he was firing at an intruder , Nel goes on
: Is an intruderâ€ ™ s life not important ?
Did he think of that life ?
Pistoriusâ€ ™ actions were gratuitous , Nel tells the judge : I can not think of a more excessive use of a firearm â€ ¦
He fired four shots that tore up the body of the deceased .
Nel turns to the issue of remorse .
Pistorius has not â€œtaken the court fully into â€ ¦ his confidenceâ€ � and so genuine remorse canâ€ ™ t be established , he says .
We still donâ€
™ t know the real reason why he fired those shots .
What motivated him ?
We donâ€
™ t know .
Nel says Pistoriusâ€ ™ acceptance of the verdict against him is because â€œhe had to â€ “ there was no other way outâ€ � .
He says Pistorius has shown regret but not remorse .
I caused her death is not the same as I murdered her .
Without that , there can be no remorse .
The prospects of rehabilitation are remote for as long as Pistorius fails to acknowledge the crime of which he has been convicted .
What the court has heard is that the accused elected to give an interview to the TV but not take this court into his confidence .
Thatâ€ ™ s disrespectful to the court , itâ€ ™ s disrespectful to the victims of this crime , itâ€ ™ s disrespectful to the deceased .
Nel says he has rarely heard such devastation from a family as that relayed by Barry Steenkamp and Kim Martin in their testimony .
He says the judge has a duty to ensure : The court will never be lenient on any crime that caused that grief .
The victims here are the mother , father and family of Reeva Steenkamp , Nel goes on .
They have rights that must be considered .
The deceased has done nothing wrong â€ ¦
She will never walk again â€ ¦
The accused murdered her .
He reminds the judge that Barry Steenkamp said he would never get over his daughterâ€ ™ s death .
The victimsâ€ ™ voices must be heard , he says , but this is not decisive : the court must still decide , even if the victim has forgiven .
Forgiveness does not mean the impact is less severe .
Justice must still be properly administered â€ ¦ despite an admission of forgiveness .
Forgiveness has more to do with the person forgiving than with the crime .
In a crime as serious as murder , retribution and deterrence should be at the fore , with rehabilitation less important , Nel says .
Weâ€
™ re dealing with a matter that is severe â€ ¦
we argue that the rehabilitation of the offender will play a relatively smaller role .
Nel says the defence witness Dr Jonathan Scholtz â€œignored the violent aspects of the accusedâ€ � â€ “ that is , the report by the prison psychologist about incidents of aggression while he was serving his sentence .
Nel says Scholtz is clearly biased .
He says it is the duty of the court to lead public opinion , not to follow it .
But it must reflect the â€œindignation and outrageâ€ � of the public and deter others : A sentence by this court should deter people from acting in this way .
Nel says it would not be appropriate to subtract time already served from any new sentence â€œfor mercyâ€ ™ s sakeâ€ � .
Pity will play no role in a sentence .
The court canâ€ ™ t be seen to condone serious crime , he adds .
Itâ€ ™ s not a clean slate .
The minimum sentencing is applicable .
Gerrie Nel continues with his argument for the state in aggravation of sentence .
He cites case law to say that â€œwholly suspendingâ€ � a prison sentence , even in compelling circumstances , is not permitted .
The starting point is 15 years , he says .
Pistorius is back in court in his suit .
Nel is set to conclude his closing argument , with Judge Masipa having indicated the court will sit today for as long as is needed to finish the sentencing hearing .
She will then retire to consider what sentence to impose .
We donâ€ ™ t yet know when she will come back with that â€ “ Friday would probably be the earliest opportunity .
The court has now adjourned for the lunch break .
Nel says the court may not impose a sentence less than the minimum prescribed for murder , which is 15 yearsâ€ ™ imprisonment .
The court does not start with a clean slate , he says .
There must be â€œtruly convincing reasons for a different responseâ€ � , he adds , reading from the regulations .
Undue sympathy is not an aspect that should be taken into consideration Correctional supervision â€ “ essentially house arrest , which is what Pistorius has been under since leaving prison last October â€ “
â€œis not even closeâ€ � to the punishment required here
, Nel tells the judge .
Nel takes on Rouxâ€ ™ s argument that the original culpable homicide verdict was â€œon the borderâ€ � of dolus eventualis and the murder verdict took it over ; the defence implied this meant a large uplift in sentence wasnâ€ ™ t necessary .
Not so , says Nel , who argues that Pistoriusâ€ ™ culpability instead borders on dolus directus â€ “ that is , the intention to kill .
He knew the toilet cubicle was small with no escape for the person inside .
He fired not one but four shots .
These are all aggravating circumstances .
Even if he thought it was an intruder , he armed himself with a firearm loaded with black talon ammunition .
We know what those bullets do to a body , Nel adds .
He says Pistorius has never given an â€œacceptable explanationâ€ � of why he fired four times .
Maybe he will tell ITV , Nel says .
But he has not done so here in court .
He reminds Masipa that Pistorius was a poor witness .
Without a credible reason why he fired , Nel says , it isnâ€ ™ t plausible to say he is remorseful :
The only plausible explanation is that the accused armed himself with the intention to shoot .
Nel moves on to the vulnerabilities outlined by the defence .
Dr Scholtz testified to Pistoriusâ€ ™ anxiety and depression , Nel says â€ “ so why did Pistorius hoard his medicine in his cell ?
Scholtz also said he should be hospitalised , Nel goes on .
Yet no steps were taken to hospitalise him .
â€œIsnâ€
™ t
it time we now finally let the world see what this accused did with four black talon rounds through a door?â€ �
Nel asks .
He says Barry Steenkamp wanted everyone to see the photographs of Reeva .
Nel says he will apply , as per the familyâ€ ™ s request , for the crime scene images to be released .
Gerrie Nel says that the argument that Pistorius thought the person behind the door was an intruder does not make it a less serious crime .
Does it detract from the fact that he is a murderer ?
He says he wonâ€ ™ t deal with perceptions but with facts .
If you want to talk about a broken man , he says , letâ€ ™ s talk about Barry Steenkamp .
Nel acknowledges that the defence says Pistorius has accepted the courtâ€ ™ s findings of murder .
That is not the same as accepting what he did , the prosecutor says .
Roux says Pistorius should be sentenced to community service .
It is for the court to decide , he adds .
But there is a reason why the trial court has discretion over sentencing .
The court should strike a balance between aggravating factors and the â€œmany , manyâ€ � mitigating factors .
The defence argument is over .
Roux sits down .
Itâ€ ™ s over to Gerrie Nel for the state .
Roux turns to the sentence : South Africa is a progressive constitutional country where punishment must have a rational purpose .
The sentence needs to be appropriate to the individual , he says .
The court needs to look for opportunities for rehabilitation .
An excessive punishment could have the opposite effect : Punishment is not meant to break the defendant â€ ¦
The accused does not fall into the category of offender who should be removed from society .
There is no purpose served .
He says a prison sentence imposed at this point is merely a â€œveil for retributionâ€ � .
The deterrent effect has already been achieved by Pistoriusâ€ ™ first stint in prison .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t have to be psychologistsâ€ � to see Pistorius is a broken man , Roux tells Masipa :
He desperately does not want to hide behind fame â€ ¦
He wants to be treated like someone unknown , someone who has done wrong and must be punished .
Pistorius replaces his prostheses as Roux tells the court : I donâ€ ™ t want to overplay vulnerability , thatâ€ ™ s not what I want to do .
I donâ€
™ t want to overplay disability .
But the time has come that we must just look with different eyes , at least with unbiased eyes .
It doesnâ€
™ t mean because heâ€ ™ s vulnerable that he can do what he likes .
Thatâ€ ™ s not what we say .
But when weâ€ ™ re entering the field of sentencing , look at that manâ€ ™ s conduct â€ ¦
Please letâ€
™ s understand â€ ¦ who is this man that you must sentence ?
Roux calls Pistorius forward .
He tells the court this will be embarrassing for his client .
He asks a weeping Pistorius to remove his prostheses and stand on his stumps in front of the court .
He does so slowly , then walks haltingly .
He appears to be in pain and struggles to retain his balance .
He holds on to a desk for support .
His doctor moves forward to support him as he stumbles .
Roux points to him , saying this is the man who was frightened by a noise at 3 am .
This is who is being sentenced .
Roux moves on to the televising of the trial .
No other accused has ever had to endure this level of publicity , misinformation and character assassination .
It was not a decision that benefited Pistorius , he says , and opened him up to a trial by public opinion and a â€œmedia frenzyâ€ � .
The perception persists that the death of Steenkamp was gender - related , Roux tells the judge : This case has nothing to do with gender violence .
The refusal by so many people to accept the facts of the case means Pistorius will never regain his status in society .
Roux points out that Pistoriusâ€ ™ original planned release from prison â€
“ approved by the parole board
â€ “ was delayed after a government minister intervened .
This has not happened to anyone else , he says .
Why wait until that last minute to intervene ?
That decision could have been made weeks earlier .
He says Pistorius has also spent many months under â€œcorrectional supervisionâ€ � ( that is , house arrest at his uncleâ€ ™ s home ) .
Roux says the isolation of confinement â€œcan amount to tortureâ€ � but the defence wonâ€ ™ t say Pistoriusâ€ ™ treatment was such .
He says Pistorius completed all his rehabilitation programmes â€ “ including one called Anger In , Anger Out â€ “ â€œwith excellenceâ€ � .
He says Pistorius has taken responsibility for what he has done .
â€œHe wants to put back , â€ �
Roux tells the court , detailing Pistoriusâ€ ™ charity work and a potential job leading an early childhood development programme .
( This is the job offer from his uncle Arnold Pistorius we heard about earlier this week . )
Roux says Pistorius has already spent 12 months in jail and that life in prison for a disabled person is hard : You do everything in your cell
â€ ¦ Youâ€ ™
re segregated , you donâ€ ™ t go to dining room to eat with the other guys , you eat in your room because youâ€ ™ re at risk .
Itâ€ ™ s punishment , we understand that â€
¦
but it does not mean itâ€ ™ s easier for him .
Roux is continuing with his closing argument for the defence .
He is reconfirming the findings from Scholtzâ€ ™
s report : anxiety , depression , post - traumatic stress disorder .
He says the PTSD is because of the shooting .
Scholtz said Pistorius should be hospitalised , he reminds the judge .
During the break , reporters in court say Pistorius has changed his clothes , from a suit to a hoodie and shorts â€ “ itâ€ ™ s possible the defence is going to discuss his prostheses .
During the break , reporters in court say Pistorius has changed his clothes , from a suit to a hoodie and shorts â€ “ possibly the defence is going to discuss his prostheses .
The court has taken a short adjournment .
Roux now turns to the report by Prof Jonathan Scholtz , a clinical psychologist who testified for the state on Monday .
Scholtz said Pistoriusâ€ ™ conditions â€ “ depression , anxiety , PTSD - had worsened .
Why would he be biased , Roux asks .
He is dismissive of one state witness , prison nurse Charlotte Mashabane who said Pistorius acted aggressively towards her .
A man in pain would demand his medication , Roux says â€ “ he would do the same .
In mitigation , Roux says , he wants the court to consider that Pistorius is â€œvilifiedâ€ � , â€œin pain constantlyâ€ � , consumed by â€œself - loathingâ€ � .
He is someone who changed perceptions of disability .
He is a first - time offender and is remorseful .
He lost a â€œperson he genuinely loved â€ ¦
he must live with that for the rest of his lifeâ€ � .
Roux reminds the court that Pistoriusâ€ ™ mental and physical vulnerabilities were taken into account in his first sentencing .
Pistorius has punished himself and will punish himself for the rest of his life , far more than any court can , he says .
Barry Rouxâ€ ™ s tactic here , it appears , is to point out all the ways in which the supreme court of appeal â€ “ while overturning the culpable homicide verdict in favour of one of murder â€ “ did not deviate from Judge Masipaâ€ ™ s original ruling .
The difference , he argues , is on a point of law .
The facts as established in Masipaâ€ ™ s ruling still stand : Pistorius did not intend to kill Steenkamp .
He was afraid , anxious and vulnerable .
That ruling initially led to a sentence of five years , of which Pistorius has already served the 10-month prison portion .
The leap to a 15-year minimum term would be too much , Roux is implying .
Roux :
It should not even be in dispute that there are significant compelling circumstances
â€
¦
He incorrectly in law fired four shots
â€
¦
but it does not mean that he did not want to protect â€
¦ it does not mean that he did not think it was an intruder .
You can not ignore that .
Roux says much of the evidence from the trial â€ “ about screams , Steenkampâ€ ™ s jeans , the fans on the balcony â€
“ is irrelevant .
It was introduced to try to make the case that Pistorius â€œacted with direct intentâ€ � to kill Steenkamp .
That argument was rejected , he says .
There was no direct intent to kill an intruder either , he says .
Pistorius did not aim at chest height .
The finding from the supreme court was that he ought to have foreseen that he could kill somebody , not that he directly intended to kill .
Roux :
He is punished for ever and ever â€ ¦
That is what he is going through because some people refuse to sit back and look at the true facts .
Roux says Pistorius â€œtook all possible steps to save the deceasedâ€ ™ s
lifeâ€ � .
He notes that the supreme court did not overturn findings that Pistorius had anxiety and was driven by fear .
Critics donâ€ ™ t want to see his vulnerability , he adds : They want to see Oscar Pistorius running to the bathroom with a gold medal round his neck .
Sentencing is subjective , Roux says .
It can deal with Pistoriusâ€ ™ vulnerability .
He was not â€œdriven by evil intentâ€ � .
He was afraid .
He was trying to protect his girlfriend .
We know where we live .
We are fearful .
A logical thought process would be : an intruder .
Roux says people felt sorry for Vleis Visagie , the rugby player who killed his own daughter .
But they did not feel sorry for Pistorius , he goes on .
In both cases , we are dealing with a reduced moral blame - worthiness , he tells the judge .
Pistorius was mistaken but he did believe himself to be in danger .
The original trial court accepted he heard a sound at 3 am .
He thought an intruder had come in through the bathroom window .
Roux is reminding the judge that her original findings broadly accepted the Pistorius version of events .
The supreme court left these findings â€œundisturbedâ€ � , he says .
Roux says Pistorius did not â€œgamble with Reevaâ€ ™ s lifeâ€ � .
He was afraid .
It was not rational .
But was he afraid of his girlfriend or an intruder , Roux asks .
He reminds Masipa that she ruled he had not meant to kill Steenkamp .
Roux says this court previously accepted that Pistorius felt himself to be in fear of his life .
He says Masipaâ€ ™ s original judgment was that his actions were â€œon the border of dolus eventualisâ€ � ( the principle that he foresaw that firing into the door could cause the death of whoever was behind it ) but that he had not foreseen it .
The supreme court ruled that he must have foreseen it .
We are talking about the difference between being on the border and across that border , Roux says .
He seems to be suggesting that this is only a small legal nudge , not warranting a sentence uplift from five to 15 years .
Roux tells judge she must not allow herself to be â€œdrowned by perceptionsâ€ � .
The supreme court considered only legal aspects , he says , not the facts of the case .
He says , therefore , that this sentencing should rely on the same facts as the original sentencing ( which resulted in a five - year term , of which Pistorius has served 10 months in prison ) .
Roux says the court must feel unease with anyone saying Pistorius must go to jail for 15 years .
He was on his stumps .
He thought his girlfriend was in the bedroom .
It can not be .
It can not be .
What do I want to happen this man , Roux asks .
He mentions rugby player Vleis Visagie , who accidentally shot and killed his daughter .
He was not prosecuted .
Roux says he is not asking here for a non - prosecution .
You can make a mistake â€ ¦
You shoot at a person under a mistaken belief .
How must you feel when you fire those shots that you should not have , and itâ€ ™ s your own girlfriend ?
What do we do ?
We criticise .
There can never be an appropriate sentence in the eyes of those who think there was an argument , Steenkamp ran to the toilet and he killed her , Roux says .
They are not the objective facts .
He says when it comes to sentencing , you can not decide a punishment based on â€œfanciful doubtâ€ � .
How can I add years , how can I ask for a more severe sentence , if the very real possibility is that he didnâ€ ™ t do it ?
There is a third enemy , Roux says : an inability to set aside the negative emotions caused by the misperceptions and look at the true facts .
He says itâ€ ™ s not about â€œwhat people thoughtâ€ � but objective evidence .
Roux says he can only have â€œempathy and sympathyâ€ � with Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents .
But he mentions ideas â€œput in their headsâ€ � .
He says a â€œsecond enemy â€ ¦ is an unwillingness or an inability â€ ¦ to see the accused in the context of that eveningâ€ � .
He says many can see only the gold medallist , the strong person winning races .
The real facts become concealed â€
¦
It was not the man winning gold medals that must be judged â€
¦
It was a 1.5 m person , standing on his stumps , three oâ€ ™ clock in the morning when it was dark .
Roux :
There are serious enemies , so to speak , in this matter .
There is a perception created that [ Pistorius ] wanted to kill the deceased â€
¦ Was it really true that he wanted to kill her ?
Is it not perhaps a different picture ?
The defence and state have now called all their witnesses and we will move on to closing arguments .
Barry Roux for the defence is up first .
He says his team compared Masipaâ€ ™ s original judgment and compared it with that handed down by the supreme court â€œin order to try to present to you a complete pictureâ€ � .
Roux pushes Martin : did she know about the Valentineâ€ ™ s card Steenkamp made for Pistorius ?
Only from court , she tells him .
Her questioning is now over .
Roux now reads from an interview in 2013 given by Steenkampâ€ ™ s friend Gina Myers in which she says Reeva was happy in her relationship .
Martin says she can not speak for Myers .
She says she doesnâ€ ™ t know what Roux expects her to say .
She says she thinks her cousin was fond of Pistorius but did not love him .
Myers , incidentally , is tweeting at the moment ; she does not appear to support this line of questioning : Barry Roux is up for the defence .
He says he was very careful and respectful with Barry Steenkamp yesterday and feels sorry for the family .
But he says the time has come to challenge some of what has been heard .
He says the family story has changed .
He reads reports from friends of Steenkampâ€ ™ s who described a good relationship between her and Pistorius .
One said Steenkamp had said she loved him and would marry him if he asked her .
Martin says this was not what her cousin told her .
They were close , she says : Reeva had the opportunity to tell me she loved Oscar and she never did .
Martin :
We just wanted the truth .
People say we got the truth , but we didnâ€ ™ t .
Oscarâ€ ™
s
version changed so many times â€
¦
He never apologised for shooting Reeva .
I donâ€
™ t feel the truth came out .
Nel says he has no further questions for Martin .
Nel asks her about family celebrations : Christmas and birthdays .
Martin says they are difficult ,
especially Valentineâ€ ™ s day , the anniversary of Steenkampâ€ ™ s death .
We donâ€ ™ t want every occasion to become a funeral .
She says Barry Steenkamp , Reevaâ€ ™ s father , is â€œa broken manâ€ � .
He feels guilt at being unable to protect his daughter .
Gerrie Nel asks her about an interview Pistorius has given to Britainâ€ ™ s ITV channel .
She says she thinks it â€œvery unfairâ€ � and â€œhurtfulâ€ � .
He had a chance to tell his story in court , she says .
Martin :
I saw my dad cry for the very first time when Reeva died , and I saw him cry for the second time when he heard I had to testify again .
To have to be exposed to the media â€ ¦
itâ€ ™ s very difficult .
She says her children â€œsuffer very muchâ€
� , as does she and her wider family : Besides the obvious anxiety and depression , as a family weâ€ ™ ll never be able to carry on life as normal .
She says people will often want to talk to her and her family about Pistorius :
Itâ€ ™ s never going to leave us .
Martin says not a day goes by without her thinking of Reeva .
She says she copes because she has to , but the scars run very deep : Weâ€ ™ ll never get over it .
Kim Martin is a cousin of Reeva Steenkamp , and previously gave evidence to this same court during Pistoriusâ€ ™ initial sentencing hearing in 2014 â€ “ at which he was given a five - year sentence for culpable homicide .
Martin told the court then that hearing news of her
cousinâ€ ™ s
death news felt like â€œthe end of the worldâ€
� :
My mother was
hysterical and thatâ€ ™ s when I knew it was true .
That was for me the end of the world .
Everything was just a blur from then onwards â€
¦
We were all like , â€˜why , why , why Reeva?â€ ™
It was the worst , worst experience I have ever , ever been through .
Judge Thokozile Masipa arrives .
She said yesterday that she wanted to conclude the testimony and arguments for both sides by the end of today , even if that meant the court sitting for longer .
Barry Steenkamp , Reevaâ€ ™ s father , said he thought the world should see the photographs of her wounds , to see â€œthe pain she must have gone throughâ€ � .
Steenkamp said he did not know his daughter was in a relationship with Pistorius .
He said he and his wife June had forgiven Pistorius because of their Christian faith .
But he added : Oscar has to pay for what he did .
He has to pay for it
â€
¦
That is up to the court .
And we will go by the decision that the court hands down to Oscar .
But he has to pay for his crime .
Prison nurse Charlotte Mashabane testified to incidents in which she said Pistorius had been aggressive towards her , although Barry Roux , for the defence , accused her of exaggerating her account to paint Pistorius in a negative light .
Clinical psychologist Professor Jonathan Scholtz gave evidence on Monday .
He said Pistorius should not return to prison : Further imprisonment would have a detrimental effect on him .
Mr Pistorius would be better served â€ ¦ if he gave back in a positive and constructive way , using his skills .
The doctor said Pistoriusâ€ ™ depression , anxiety , paranoia and social phobia had worsened since his trial .
He has post - traumatic stress disorder but is not a psychopath .
His risk of violent reoffending was low .
Ebba Gudny Gudmundsdottir , from Iceland , gave evidence yesterday .
She said Pistorius had become a close friend when she contacted him about her son , who was born without legs .
The then athlete had encouraged him when he struggled with his prostheses and gave him one of his gold medals .
Pastor Marius Nel said Pistorius was a member of his church and had volunteered to work with schools to help students with fitness and nutrition .
The pastor visited Pistorius in prison and found him â€œa broken manâ€ � .
Today the state is due to put forward its final witness in the sentencing hearing that will determine the fate of Oscar Pistorius .
He faces a possible 15-year prison sentence after his conviction for the culpable homicide of Reeva Steenkamp in 2013 was upgraded to murder by South Africaâ€ ™ s supreme court .
Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel told the court yesterday that his last witness would today offer â€œemotional evidenceâ€ � on the impact of the murder .
The high court in Pretoria has so far heard moving testimony from Barry Steenkamp , Reevaâ€ ™ s father , who broke down as he told the judge , Thokozile Masipa , that he talked to his daughter everyday , and had pushed diabetes needles into his arms and stomach to try to share in the pain she must have felt .
Pistorius killed Steenkamp , his girlfriend , by firing four bullets through a locked toilet cubicle door at his Pretoria home .
He has always claimed he believed he was tackling an intruder .
Iâ€ ™ ll post a summary shortly of the evidence heard so far .
My colleague Jason Burke has been in court and filed this dispatch on yesterdayâ€ ™ s hearing .

2016-06-23,"Oscar Pistorius has admitted he deserves a long jail sentence for killing Reeva Steenkamp but vehemently denied he murdered her , insisting that the 2013 shooting was not premeditated .
In his first TV interview since his girlfriendâ€ ™ s death , Pistorius said he â€œcouldnâ€ ™ t disagreeâ€ � with those who felt he should be punished .
â€œAt times
I donâ€ ™ t feel like I should have the right to live for taking someone elseâ€ ™ s life .
Whatâ€ ™ s difficult is dealing with the charge of murder , â€ �
he said .
But Pistorius said he did not want to â€œwaste my lifeâ€ � behind bars .
â€œIf I was afforded the opportunity of redemption I would like to help the less fortunate like I had in my past , â€ � he said .
â€œI would like to believe that if Reeva could look down upon me that she would want me to live that life.â€ � Pistorius made the comments during an interview with ITV , to be broadcast at 9 pm on Friday .
The interview â€ “ at times frank , at other points self - exculpatory , and with moments of prolonged sobbing and even howling â€ “ comes days before a South African judge will sentence Pistorius for murder .
He was convicted in 2014 of manslaughter , but last year the conviction was upgraded to murder following an appeal by state prosecutors .
The minimum sentence for murder in South Africa is 15 years .
However , legal experts say judge Thokozile Masipa has considerable powers of discretion .
In the interview , Pistorius â€ “ who made his name as an Olympic and Paralympic athlete , reaching the 400 m semi - finals of London 2012 â€ “ stuck to the same account he has given of the shooting of Steenkamp on 14 February 2013 , Valentineâ€ ™ s Day , inside his gated home in Pretoria .
He said Steenkampâ€ ™ s death was a tragic accident caused by his sincere belief that an intruder was breaking into the apartment .
Pistorius said he arrived home just after 6 pm to find Reeva â€œsmiling and giddy and just bubblyâ€ � .
She had cooked a romantic meal and laid the table with a candle .
After , they lay down on the bed and chatted , he said , adding that â€œwhen I came in the room I placed my firearm on the left hand side of the bedâ€ � .
Pistorius said he took his prosthetic legs off and fell asleep .
It was â€œpitch darkâ€ � .
At 3 am he woke .
â€œI heard this noise coming from the bathroom , â€ � he said .
â€œIt was a sliding noise of the window frame hitting the frame.â€ �
He claimed he â€œimmediately got panickedâ€ � and believed that â€œsomeone was actually in the process of breaking inâ€ � , possibly with a ladder .
The athlete said he scooped up his firearm and , believing Steenkamp was still in the room , whispered to her to get down and ring the police .
He said he was terrified as he walked toward the bathroom on his stumps , gun in hand .
â€œAll
of a sudden
I heard a noise , at the toilet ,
â€ � he said .
â€œI presumed it was the toilet door opening and before I know it Iâ€ ™
d fired four shots.â€ � Prosecutors have dismissed Pistoriusâ€ ™ s account as lies .
They say the athlete murdered Steenkamp after a row prompted by his jealousy over an ex - boyfriend .
They say she fled to the bathroom and barricaded herself in the toilet , pursued by Pistorius who first tried to smash the door down with a cricket bat and then returned with his 9 mm weapon , firing into the door from point - blank range .
Pistorius said he felt a moment of horror when he realised Steenkamp was not in the bed but then experienced a short - lived â€œsense of calmâ€ � , thinking that she was hiding on the floor .
He got down on the floor , however , and realised he still couldnâ€ ™ t feel her .
â€œSo
I start pulling everything apart
and I start saying like , Reeva , Reeva Reeva , and Iâ€ ™ m like pulling my hand and Iâ€ ™ m on my stumps now still
, I was like pulling my hand across the curtain
â€ ¦ thinking like â€˜lord please tell me sheâ€ ™ s hiding behind the curtainsâ€ ™ .
And I get to the end of the curtains and my heart
just sinks.â€ �
Pistorius said he looped back to the bathroom , and broke down the door to to the toilet with a cricket bat , ripping out one plank .
Inside , he found Steenkamp slumped on the toilet .
She was dead .
There was blood everywhere , he said .
He said he put her on the bathroom floor , placing a towel under her head .
â€œI
just see blood and itâ€ ™
s just blood everywhere ...
So much blood !
I try and pick her up .
Iâ€ ™ m trying to pick her up but thereâ€ ™ s
so much blood
I canâ€
™ t stand up .
â€œAnd I thought Reeva had started breathing , so I had my fingers in her mouth
and I was trying to give her mouth to mouth , but there was so much blood.â€ � South Africaâ€ ™ s supreme court was unimpressed by Pistoriusâ€ ™ s testimony , describing him as vacillating , untruthful and a â€œvery poor witnessâ€ � .
Masipa , who heard his original trial , has further described him as â€œevasiveâ€ � and â€œclearly not candidâ€ � .
The athlete told ITV he had not always been convincing while giving evidence , but blamed his performance on his long court and police ordeal .
His defence team say he is suffering from anxiety and depression .
At last weekâ€ ™ s sentencing hearing he walked across the courtroom floor on his stumps .
At the same hearing , Steenkampâ€ ™ s father Barry said his daughterâ€ ™ s murder had devastated their family .
News of the ITV interview clearly annoyed the state prosecutor Gerry Nel , who told the court it gave the lie to the claim that the athlete was unable to testify , adding that it was â€œdisrespectfulâ€ � .
Pistorius told ITV he â€œsaw the painâ€ � he had caused and said that most of his mutual friends with Steenkamp â€œdonâ€ ™ t speak to me any moreâ€ � .
One woman had spotted him shopping in Pretoria and had screamed at the store for allowing him in .
He put down his basket and left , he said .
Pistorius denied some of the allegations levelled against him , including that he had behaved violently to Steenkamp before he shot her , hitting her with a cricket bat , and that he had taken steroids .
Asked whether he was violent towards women , he said : â€œNo , not at all.â€ �
The athlete said he owned nine to 11 firearms , and had ordered a semi - automatic assault rifle , but added that he kept only his 9 mm gun at home .
Asked why he needed such an arsenal , Pistorius said that like all South Africans he had direct and traumatic personal experience of violent crime .
He said when he was growing up his father had been hijacked and beaten , and his brother hijacked , while a cousin who lived nearby was robbed at home in the middle of the day .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t know anybody in South Africa that hasnâ€ ™ t experienced some form of crime.â€
�
The dark consequence was â€œyou get this fear â€ ¦
Itâ€ ™
s just the reality we live in.â€ �"
2016-06-25,"The famous man who killed Reeva Steenkamp doesnâ€ ™ t want to go back to jail , and thinks she wouldnâ€ ™ t want him to .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t want to have to waste my life sitting there , â€ � he wails .
â€œIf I was afforded the opportunity of redemption , I would like the opportunity to help those less fortunate , like I had in my past .
I would like to believe that , if Reeva could look down upon me , she would want me to live that life.â€ �
At which point itâ€ ™ s hard not to yell at your television : â€œShe might also like the opportunity to have her own life back again and not be dead.â€ �
Oscar Pistorius : The Interview ( ITV ) is often uncomfortable viewing .
Uncomfortable because it relives a horrible killing ; because of the apparently broken man at its centre ; because it puts you in the position of the judge ( no juries in South Africa ) , makes you decide the extent of the manâ€ ™ s guilt and how genuine his whimpering remorse is ; and because it makes you wonder why the hell heâ€ ™ s doing this interview with investigative reporter and former copper Mark Williams - Thomas .
It starts with a bit of background â€ “ disability , strong mum , running , can - do attitude , can - do anything .
Then meeting Reeva , how kind and bubbly she was .
Then Pistorius takes Williams - Thomas through the fateful night in all its details â€ “ some really strange , such as her saying : â€œCome , letâ€
™ s go brush our teeth.â€
�
( Really ? )
But , basically , he sticks exactly to his story from the trial â€
“ that it was all a terrible accident â€
“ except this time we get to see him , as well as hear him and read about him .
That was the right place for this , though : in court , in a proper trial , with prosecution and defence , rather than a television interview at his uncleâ€ ™ s house just before his sentencing for murder .
Thatâ€ ™ s what this must be about :
an appeal for leniency , less time in jail , the opportunity for redemption and to help those less fortunate .
It is , after all , what Reeva would have wanted .
I have no idea if it will work .
It may even backfire .
But it certainly made me uncomfortable ."
2016-07-05,"Oscar Pistorius , the South African Olympic and Paralympic athlete who killed his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , by firing four bullets through a closed toilet door , will learn on Wednesday how long he will spend in prison for murder .
In what is likely to be the final chapter in a story that attracted intense worldwide attention , Judge Thokozile Masipa will sentence the former athlete .
Most observers expect a lengthy prison term .
Pistorius , 29 , who found global fame when he reached the semi - finals of the 200-metre sprint at the 2012 Olympics in London , was initially convicted of culpable homicide and sentenced to five years in prison .
After an appeal by state prosecutors he was convicted of murder , which carries a mandatory sentence of 15 years .
He has exhausted almost every legal option available to him .
However , legal experts point out that Masipa has considerable discretion .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think he will get the 15 years , â€ �
Ulrich Roux , a lawyer unaffiliated with the case but who has followed it closely , told AFP .
â€œHis personal circumstances and the disability will be taken into account .
One possibility is that part of the sentence may be suspended.â€ �
Others suggested eight years was a likely jail term .
Under South African law , Pistorius , who has been living in his uncleâ€ ™ s large home in a suburb of Pretoria , would be be eligible for parole long before the end of the sentence .
The former athlete has always denied deliberately shooting Steenkamp , a model and law graduate , claiming that he believed a burglar was hiding in the toilet in his home .
In a television interview broadcast last month , Pistorius said that if he â€œwas afforded the opportunity of redemption , [ he ] would like to help the less fortunateâ€ � .
On the third and final day of the sentencing hearing last month , Pistorius , sobbing , hobbled on his stumps across the courtroom to demonstrate his physical vulnerability as his lawyers argued he should not return to jail on account of post - traumatic stress disorder and depression .
A day before , Barry Steenkamp , 73 , the father of the victim , tearfully called for Pistorius to â€œpay for his crimeâ€ � .
Legal experts say it is extremely unlikely that the sportsman will be able to challenge the sentence he receives , though the state may appeal if it is seen as lenient ."
2016-07-06,"At 10.32am , an hour after she started reading her decision , Judge Thokozile Masipa paused for an instant , turned a page and said to Oscar Pistorius : â€œPlease rise.â€
�
â€œThe sentence I impose on the accused for the murder of the deceased â€
¦ is six years imprisonment , â€ � Masipa said .
A small gasp went up from the back of the courtroom , where supporters of the South African Olympic and Paralympic athlete sat alongside campaigners who had pressed for a long custodial sentence .
Pistorius , who killed his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , by firing four bullets through a closed toilet door in February 2013 , showed no emotion and , after a brief embrace from his sister , was led down to the cells .
It was a curiously uneventful end to a trial that has included intense drama , emotion and controversy over more than three years .
State prosecutors had demanded the mandatory minimum proscribed in South Africa for murder , 15 years , saying a strong deterrent message was needed in a country that suffers from extremely high levels of violent crime , often involving firearms .
They may still challenge Masipaâ€ ™ s decision to impose a significantly lower term , but currently this looks unlikely .
Doup De Bruyn , a lawyer and a representative of the Steenkamp family , said they respected the judgeâ€ ™ s decision and would maintain â€œa dignified silenceâ€ � .
â€œThere is nothing we can do about the sentence .
Nothing will bring Reeva back , â€ � De Bruyn said .
Pistorius , who found global fame when he reached the semi - finals of the 200 m sprint at the 2012 Olympics in London , arrived at Gauteng high court in Pretoria looking anxious , but healthier than during sentencing hearings last month .
Relatives of the former athlete and his victim filled a bench at the front of the courtroom .
Barry and June Steenkamp , Reevaâ€ ™ s parents , sat only metres from the man who killed their daughter .
Masipa said the evidence she had heard convinced her that Pistorius was â€œnot a violent personâ€ � , was unlikely to re - offend and had showed remorse .
Pistorius , she said on Wednesday , was â€œa fallen hero who has lost his career and been ruined financially .
Having killed someone he loved â€ ¦ he can not be at peaceâ€ � .
The judge said she had to balance the interests of society , the accused and the relatives of the victim , but stressed that a court should not seek to satisfy public opinion .
Her original decision to convict Pistorius of culpable homicide , or manslaughter in English law , prompted a public outcry .
It was overturned by the supreme court last year .
â€œThe court has a duty to correct wrong impressions and prevent unjustified outrage , â€ �
she said , although punishment must also reflect the seriousness of the offence and be â€œunpleasant , uncomfortable and painfulâ€ � .
Under South African law , Pistorius , who has been living in his uncleâ€ ™ s large home in a suburb of Pretoria after being released into house arrest last year , will be eligible for parole long before the end of the new sentence .
Pistorius , 29 , was a hero to many in South Africa and across the world .
He landed a series of lucrative sponsorship deals with leading brands and was labelled the â€œblade runnerâ€ � , a reference to the carbon - fibre prosthetics he used to compete .
But the fairytale story of tenacity and talent overcoming disability ended abruptly in the early hours of 14 February 2013 , when Pistorius , whose lower legs were amputated when he was 11 months old , shot Steenkamp dead with a 9 mm handgun .
Tens of millions around the world followed the trial that ensued .
Almost every minute of more than 40 days of psychological drama , police procedural and legal argument was broadcast live on South African television â€ “ and massively amplified by social media .
Pistorius denied deliberately shooting Steenkamp , claiming that he believed a burglar was hiding in the toilet in his home .
Prosecutors said he killed Steenkamp in a jealous rage .
The trial revealed a dark side to Pistorius : a taste for fast cars and guns , and a short temper .
In court on Wednesday , Masipa said she accepted the defenceâ€ ™ s version of events , but stressed that â€œmurder is always a very serious crime â€ ¦ the fact that the accused thought it was an intruder does not make it any less seriousâ€ � .
She described Steenkamp as â€œyoung , vivacious , full of life and hopes for the futureâ€ � .
On the final day of the three - day sentencing hearing last month , Pistorius removed his prosthetics to hobble on his stumps across the courtroom , to demonstrate his physical vulnerability .
His defence lawyers argued that , although he appeared to be an â€œOlympian supermanâ€ � , the athlete was a deeply anxious person .
A day before , in an emotional testimony , Barry Steenkamp , the 73-year - old father of the victim , said Pistorius should â€œpay for his crimeâ€ � .
With his hands shaking and his voice trembling , Steenkamp described the intense pain of bereavement .
He made no comment after the sentencing on Wednesday .
Anneliese Burgess , a spokesperson for the Pistorius family , said the trial had been a â€œlong , drawn - out processâ€ � .
â€œTo a certain extent , there is relief that this is the last chapter , that they wonâ€ ™ t be coming back ,
â€ �
she told reporters outside the courthouse .
Carl Pistorius , the accusedâ€ ™ s brother , said on social media that â€œjustice has been doneâ€ � , while defence lawyers said they were satisfied with the sentence .
Commentators say the killing and the trial held a mirror to South Africa more than 20 years after the end of apartheid and the advent of democracy .
â€œIn the same way that [ Nelson ] Mandela was the symbol of the country in the glorious years of generosity and pragmatism and all those good things , the cataclysmic fall [ of Pistorius ] was a metaphor for broader disappointed dreams , â€ �
John Carlin , who attended the trial and has written a book on the former athlete , told the Guardian last month .
Campaigners for womenâ€ ™ s rights in South Africa expressed disappointment at the sentence .
â€œThe judgment is an insult to women .
It sends the wrong message , â€ � said Jacqui Mofokeng of the African National Congress Womenâ€ ™ s League , who has attended much of the trial .
Jeanine Terreblanche , a 28-year - old IT specialist , travelled 186 miles ( 300 km ) from her hometown of Welkom to â€œshow support for Oscarâ€ � .
She said the decision was â€œfairâ€ � .
â€œI still believe it was an accident , and I think he has been through more than any other person who has ever committed this kind of offence , especially with the media interest and public opinion and the criticism of the campaigners , â€ � Terreblanche said .
Around her , the scores of photographers and newspaper reporters covering the trial slowly dispersed , while police kept onlookers away from dozens of television journalists still broadcasting from the busy Pretoria street ."
2016-07-06,"Oscar Pistorius , the South African Olympic and Paralympic athlete who killed his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , by firing four bullets through a closed toilet door , has been sentenced to a lower than expected six years in prison .
The sentence , given by Judge Thokozile Masipa in the high court in Pretoria , may be the final chapter in a story that attracted intense worldwide attention .
Pistorius , who gained global fame when he reached the semi - finals of the 200 m sprint at the 2012 Olympics in London , was taken down to cells immediately after the sentencing at 10.30am on Wednesday .
The former athlete showed little emotion , but looked relieved .
His family made no immediate statement .
The sentence was much lower than many had expected and public prosectors had demanded the mandatory minimum for murder of 15 years .
Andrew Fawcett , a defence lawyer , said : â€œWe respect the decision of Judge Masipa and from a defence perspective we will not be making any application [ to appeal].â€ � Public prosecutors may decide to challenge the sentence but supporters of the Steenkamps said â€œthe law has run its courseâ€ � .

Relatives of Pistorius and those of his victim filled a bench along the front of the courtroom .
Prosecutors had called for the mandatory minimum , saying that a message needed to be sent in a country with extremely high levels of violent crime , often involving firearms .
Defence lawyers had argued that a non - custodial sentence â€ “ such as community service
â€ “ would be most appropriate .
In an hour - long judgment , Masipa said the evidence she had heard convinced her Pistorius was â€œnot a violent personâ€ � , was unlikely to reoffend and had shown remorse .
The judge said she had to balance the interests of society , the accused and relatives of the victim .
Pistorius , she said , was â€œa fallen hero , who has lost his career , and been ruined financially .
He can not be at peace.â€ �
She also stressed that a court should not be swayed by public opinion but that punishment must also reflect the seriousness of the offence .
It should be â€œunpleasant , uncomfortable and painfulâ€ � .
Under South African law , Pistorius , who has been living in his uncleâ€ ™ s large home in a suburb of Pretoria , would be eligible for parole long before the end of the sentence .
Pistorius , who became the first double - leg amputee to participate in the Olympics in 2012 , was a hero to many in South Africa and across the world .

The trial revealed a different and much darker side to Pistorius : a taste for fast cars and guns â€ “ and a short temper .
His defence lawyers argued that , though a hero to many , the truth was that the athlete was a deeply anxious man .
On the third and final day of the sentencing hearing last month , Pistorius removed his prosthetics to hobble on his stumps across the courtroom to demonstrate his physical vulnerability .
Barry Roux , who led the team representing the former athlete , argued he should not return to jail on account of post - traumatic stress disorder and depression and called a clinical psychologist as a witness who told the court Pistorius was a â€œbroken manâ€ � who has â€œleft his fate up to Godâ€ � .
â€œ[In
2014
I saw two Oscars â€
¦ one was this super - Olympian , very successful , who seemed totally in control and even physically tall with his prostheses .
Then there was the other [ Oscar ] without his prostheses who was a vulnerable , anxious man .
More recently , I saw a third Oscar that really has almost given up .
His spirit seems broken .
I believe he is quite ill .
If he was my patient , I would admit him to hospital , â€ �
Prof Jonathan Scholtz told the court .
But , in emotional testimony , Barry Steenkamp , the 73-year - old father of the victim , called for Pistorius to â€œpay for his crimeâ€ � .
With his hands shaking and voice trembling , Steenkamp described the moment he learned of his daughterâ€ ™ s death and the intense pain of bereavement .
â€œEver since Reevaâ€ ™ s death I have spent my time on my veranda , at two or three in the morning .
I smoke my cigarettes .
I think of Reeva every day , every day of my life , morning , noon and night
â€
¦ I talk to her every day in my head â€ ¦ my daughter , â€ � he said .
During the sentencing hearing Gerrie Nel , leading the prosecution team , told Masipa any sentence needed to consider the needs of the broader community and send a strong message to deter violent crime .
â€œI can not think of a more excessive use of a firearm than â€
¦ firing four shots through that doorway
, â€ � said Nel , whose belligerent style has attracted both praise and criticism .
â€œMurder remains the most reprehensible crime â€ ¦ Society demands that appropriate sentences be imposed.â€ �
The killing and the trial also held a mirror to South Africa more than 20 years after the end of apartheid and the coming of democracy amid widespread disillusionment at a perceived failure to achieve the lofty goals of that time .
â€œIn the same way that [ Nelson ] Mandela was the symbol of the country in the glorious years of generosity and pragmatism and all those good things ,
Pistorius â€ ¦ was a national icon of whom everyone was proud .
His cataclysmic fall was a metaphor for broader disappointed dreams , â€ �
John Carlin , who attended the trial and is the author of a book on the former athlete , told the Guardian last month ."
2016-07-06,"Oscar Pistorius has been sentenced to six yearsâ€ ™ imprisonment for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp in 2013 .
Judge Thokozile Masipa said there were â€œsubstantial and compelling circumstancesâ€ � that meant he should not serve the 15-year minimum sentence for murder .
Masipa said the continuing misperception that Pistorius had intentionally killed Steenkamp was something the court had a duty to correct â€œto prevent unjustified outrage from the publicâ€ � : Our courts are courts of law , not courts of public opinion .
In an hour - long judgment , she said : The life of the accused will never be the same â€ ¦
He is a fallen hero , who has lost his career , and been ruined financially .
He can not be at peace .
But she rejected the defence argument that Pistorius ought to be hospitalised or serve a non - custodial punishment , saying the sentence ought to be unpleasant , uncomfortable and painful .
Masipa said the mitigating factors â€ “ that he was vulnerable on his stumps , believed there was an intruder , tried to save Steenkampâ€ ™ s life and was , in the judgeâ€ ™ s view , genuinely remorseful â€ “ â€œoutweighedâ€ � the aggravating factors , which she listed as using a lethal weapon , with high - grade ammunition , firing four times with no warning shot , and â€œknowing full wellâ€
�
there was someone inside the toilet cubicle .
The murder of Steenkamp was not , she said , a case of gender violence : There is no indication at all that the deceased was in an abusive relationship .
The judge said she had also taken into account the effect on Steenkampâ€ ™ s family : The pain runs deep and â€ ¦ the impact of the accusedâ€ ™ s conduct on the family of the deceased has been devastating .
The defence team said it would not appeal against the sentence .
The state has not yet said whether it intends to appeal on the grounds the sentence was too lenient ( Pistoriusâ€ ™ sentence for his original conviction for culpable homicide was five years ) .
The state has 14 days to decide .
Anneliese Burgess , a spokesperson for the Pistorius family , said the trial had been a â€œlong , drawn - out processâ€
� :
To a certain extent there is relief that this is the last chapter , that they wonâ€ ™ t be coming back .
However , campaigners for womenâ€ ™ s rights in South Africa expressed disappointment with the sentence .
Jacqui Mofokeng of the African National Congress womenâ€ ™ s league , who has attended much of the trial and was in court today ,
said : The judgment is an insult to women .
It sends the wrong message .
A convoy of police vehicles is now leaving the court house with sirens blaring â€ “ including a van presumably carrying Oscar Pistorius to prison , though he was not visible .
The instructing attorney for the defence , Andrew Fawcett , has told reporters that the Pistorius team does not intend to appeal the sentence and that they respect Masipaâ€ ™ s decision .
Pistorius will serve the sentence handed down by the court , he says , adding that he will have to serve â€œbetween half and two - thirds of the sentenceâ€ � before he can apply for parole .
But he adds that the defence team will of course â€œreactâ€ � if the state decides to appeal the sentence .
The Guardianâ€ ™ s Africa correspondent writes from Pretoria of the moment
those in court heard the six - year sentence handed down to Pistorius : The 29-year - old former athlete showed little emotion , but looked relieved .
His family made no immediate statement .
The sentence was much lower than many had expected .
Public prosectors had demanded the mandatory minimum for murder of 15 years .
An appeal from Pistorius is considered unlikely , though public prosecutors may decide to challenge the sentence .
However , supporters of the Steenkamps said : The law has run its course .
Doup De Bruyn , a lawyer who has represented the family , said : There is nothing [ the family ] can do about the sentence .
Nothing will bring Reeva back .
The best thing to do is to maintain a dignified silence .
Pistorius arrived for court today looking anxious but healthier than during the hearings last month .
He hugged members of his legal team and his family .
The relatives of the former athlete and those of his victim filled a bench along the front of the courtroom .
In an hour - long judgment , Judge Masipa said evidence she had heard convinced her Pistorius was â€œnot a violent personâ€ � , was unlikely to reoffend and had showed remorse .
The judge said she had to balance the interests of society , the accused and relatives of the victim .
Pistorius , she said , was â€œa fallen hero , who has lost his career , and been ruined financially .
He can not be at peace.â€ �
She also stressed that a court should not be swayed by public opinion but that punishment must also reflect the seriousness of the offence .
It should be â€œunpleasant , uncomfortable and painfulâ€ � .
This is the scene outside the North Gauteng high court â€ “ at some point Oscar Pistorius will be taken from here to prison .
Carl Pistorius , the brother of Oscar Pistorius , has just tweeted this response to the verdict : The Pistorius family is expected to make a statement shortly .
It is likely to come via Arnold Pistorius , Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ uncle , who tends to speak for the family .
Oscar Pistorius hugged his sister Aimee , pictured below , and his brother Carl ( in the blue jacket ) before he was taken down to the cells after hearing his sentence .
He is expected to be moved directly to prison today .
In delivering her decision , Masipa said she had considered both aggravating and mitigating factors , and concluded that the latter outweighed the former .
She listed mitigating factors as : Pistorius was vulnerable on his stumps without his protheses .
He believed the person in the bathroom was an intruder .
He â€œimmediately took steps to try to save the deceasedâ€ ™ s
lifeâ€ � .
The judge believed he was genuinely remorseful .
She said the aggravating factors were : Pistorius used a lethal weapon , with high - grade ammunition .
He fired four times , â€œknowing full wellâ€
�
there was someone in the bathroom .
He did not take the precaution of firing a warning shot .
Reporters in the courtroom say the defence team will not appeal against the sentence ( itâ€ ™ s not clear on what grounds it might have been able to do so ) .
And on that note , some views from South African media : It is notable that Pistoriusâ€ ™ original sentence , when he was initially found guilty of culpable homicide ( the equivalent of manslaughter ) , was five years .
He served 10 months of that in prison before being eligible for parole under house arrest .
The increase in sentence â€ “ bearing in mind the judge spelt out how much more serious a crime murder is â€ “ was just one year .
It is not clear yet how much of the six - year sentence he will be compelled to serve in prison before he will once again be eligible for parole .
Masipa left the courtroom swiftly after delivering the sentence but said she would be available to hear an appeal today if that was required .
Previous reports have said that an appeal would not be available to Pistorius , but that it might be possible for the state to argue against a sentence if it thought it was too lenient .
Pistorius has been taken down to the cells .
The courtroom is very quiet .
Reporters in the room say there has been little visible reaction from the Steenkamp family , who are there .
But Pistoriusâ€ ™ sister Aimee has left the court in tears .
Judge Masipa has sentenced Oscar Pistorius to six yearsâ€ ™ imprisonment for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp .
She said there were â€œsubstantial and compelling reasonsâ€ � to deviate from the 15-year minimum sentence for murder , citing as one factor the continuing misperception that Pistorius had intended to kill his girlfriend .
The judge asks Pistorius to stand .
She imposes a sentence of six years .
She says it was a â€œnoble gestureâ€ � of Pistorius to offer to do community service .
But punishment is not what you choose to do .
It ought to be painful .
But she says a long - term imprisonment will not serve justice .
Masipa moves on to her conclusion .
No sentence will please everyone , she says .
Nothing will bring back the deceased .
The life of the accused will never be the same .
He is a fallen hero
â€
¦
He can not be at peace .
She says she was not surprised to hear him described as a broken man .
Masipa says she is not convinced by the evidence given by Scholtz that Pistorius ought to be hospitalised .
Pistorius has already spent time in prison , Masipa says .
The court heard evidence that he struggled as an inmate .
But she does not accept that he was â€œvilifiedâ€ � or treated badly by prison officials .
But on reports that he was aggressive to prison staff , Masipa says : [ Being ] quick - tempered does not necessarily mean he is a violent person .
The rehabilitation programmes may not be sufficient now that Pistoriusâ€ ™ conviction has been upgraded to murder , the judge says .
( He undertook them when serving his sentence for culpable homicide . )
But she says it indicates that he is a â€œgood candidate for rehabilitationâ€ � .
The defence wants a non - custodial sentence , Masipa says .
They cited workshops on anger management as proof he had been rehabilitated .
But deterrence and retribution are just as important , she says .
Masipa accepts the case put forward by the defence that there are â€œtwo Oscarsâ€ � â€ “ the successful athlete and the vulnerable disabled man .
( See here for more on the â€œtwo Oscarsâ€ � evidence . )
But this is not the only factor for her to consider , she goes on .
Masipa is speaking at length about what she calls the â€œmisperceptionâ€ � that Pistorius intended to kill Steenkamp and the duty of the court to correct that view .
Public opinion may be loud and persistent but it can play no role in the decision of this court .
Masipa :
Our courts are courts of law , not courts of public opinion .
She says â€œpublic indignationâ€
� must be based on facts .
Wrong perceptions exist in this case , she says , and it is the duty of the court to correct it â€œto prevent unjustified outrage from the publicâ€ � .
Masipa outlines what she finds are the â€œsubstantial and compelling circumstancesâ€ � for reducing the 15-year minimum sentence .
( She has not yet said what the sentence will be . )
She says Pistorius was on his stumps and was vulnerable .
She accepts that the pain of the Steenkamp family is â€œreal and it is tangibleâ€ � .
But she says the â€œmisperceptionâ€ � persists that Pistorius intended to kill Reeva Steenkamp and that â€œcannot be ignoredâ€ � .
Masipa says mitigating factors outweigh the aggravating ones , and there are compelling reasons to deviate from the 15-year minimum .
The state said Pistorius showed no remorse , Masipa notes .
I disagree .
She says he apologised in court , having â€œpreviously and unsuccessfullyâ€ � trying to contact the Steenkamp family privately , more than once .
She interprets this as undermining any notion that he apologised as a â€œployâ€ � .
She says he would only persist in his efforts to apologise to the family because â€œhe was genuinely remorsefulâ€ � .
Turning to mitigating factors , Masipa says Pistorius was vulnerable without his protheses .
He believed the person in the bathroom was an intruder .
He â€œimmediately took steps to try to save the deceasedâ€ ™ s
lifeâ€ � .
Masipa says the more uneasy a court feels about a sentence , the more likely it is that an injustice can be perpetrated .
She now turns to the aggravating factors in this case .
Pistorius used a lethal weapon , with high - grade ammunition , and fired four times , â€œknowing full wellâ€ � there was someone in the bathroom .
He did not take the precaution of firing a warning shot .
She says it is incumbent on the court to consider whether any sentence is proportionate to the offence , taking into account the seriousness of the crime and the culpability of the offender .
To deviate from the minimum sentence , she says , it must take into account the particular circumstances of the case ; she mentions those â€œsubstantial and compelling circumstancesâ€ � again .
Masipa has not yet given an indication of whether she thinks there are â€œsubstantial and compelling circumstancesâ€ � in this case .
Masipa says the court is obliged to impose the minimum sentence of 15 years unless there are â€œsubstantial and compellingâ€ � reasons to reduce it .
She says it is up to the court to decide what constitutes â€œsubstantial and compellingâ€ � circumstances .
She says Reeva Steenkampâ€ ™ s family continues to suffer as a result of her death .
It is not surprising that the family is still grieving , Masipa adds .
They had â€œa very close bond â€ ¦
they feel the loss
deeplyâ€ � : The pain runs deep and â€ ¦ the impact of the accusedâ€ ™ s conduct on the family of the deceased has been devastating .
Masipa says she must take this into account when deciding the sentence .
Societyâ€ ™ s expectations for punishment â€œcannot be legitimate if they are based on wrong perceptionsâ€ � , Masipa tells the court .
The interests of society , Masipa says , demand that crimes of murder be punished severely .
But the demands must be legitimate , she goes on .
She points out that the defence argued that the perception persists that Pistorius deliberately killed Steenkamp .
This perception was proven , she says , by Barry Steenkamp in his own evidence ( Gerrie Nel , the prosecutor , was forced to intervene when Steenkamp appeared to say he did believe the shooting was intentional ) .
Masipa says this is not a case of gender violence : There is no indication at all that the deceased was in an abusive relationship .
June and Barry Steenkamp are once again hearing in court the details of their daughterâ€
™ s death .
Masipa recounts evidence that witnesses on the scene in the aftermath of the shooting believed Pistoriusâ€ ™ distress to be genuine .
Masipa moves on to the circumstances of the murder .
She says it is important to consider these in every case .
Murder is always a very serious crime .
That the accused thought it was an intruder does not make it any less serious .
Scholtz â€œdid not fare well under cross - examinationâ€ � , Masipa says .
He could not back up some of the claims made , about the prison experience or claims that medication was withheld from Pistorius in prison .
But she says she did find Scholtz a truthful witness .
The judge says Scholtzâ€ ™ s report argued that Pistorius had suffered from media attention and negative experiences in prison , such as overhearing the rape of an inmate and witnessing his subsequent hanging .
But she says , these were â€œnot supported by anything concreteâ€ � .
Evidence from a prison employee suggested it was not possible for him to have witnessed this , Masipa says .
Masipa recites evidence given during the sentencing hearing that Pistorius has sold all his firearms and does not want to use a gun ever again .
Pistorius looks solemn as Masipa outlines his motherâ€ ™ s anxiety around crime , and her death when he was a teenager .
Scholtzâ€ ™ s report , she reads , says Pistoriusâ€ ™ childhood experiences made â€œhim aware of his own and his familyâ€ ™
s vulnerability to crimeâ€ � .
The judge now turns to what she calls his â€œpersonal circumstancesâ€ � .
Itâ€ ™ s essentially a rundown of his family and career history , by now well rehearsed in this courtroom .
She notes that he has no previous convictions .
Masipa skips through the evidence given by the two other defence witnesses , who testified to Pistoriusâ€ ™ charity work and his desire to work in future with children .
Scholtz found that Pistorius displayed symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder , anxiety and depression , and was not well enough to testify in the sentencing proceedings .
( Pistorius did not give evidence in those hearings last month . )
Masipa notes that Scholtz was of the opinion that Pistorius ought to be hospitalised .
Among the factors she needs to consider , Masipa says , she must decide whether there is any cause not to impose the 15-year minimum sentence .
She says she has considered all the evidence but will not set it all out in detail now .
She will talk about the evidence given by defence witness Professor Jonathan Scholtz , a clinical psychologist who reported on Pistoriusâ€ ™ mental state .
Masipa begins by setting out the process so far : the original finding , the appeal and the decision by the supreme court to overturn the first verdict and substitute one of murder .
It is for this court now to impose the appropriate sentence for murder , she says .
Judge Thokozile Masipa is in the courtroom and the hearing is starting .
Pistorius will be sentenced today by the same judge who presided over his original trial , Thokozile Masipa .
Having initially found him guilty of culpable homicide â€ “ and clearing him of murder â€ “ Masipa sentenced Pistorius in September 2014 to five years in prison .
He served 10 months in Kgosi Mampuru prison , before being released ( in accordance with parole regulations ) under house arrest conditions .
He has lived at the home of his aunt and uncle , Lois and Arnold Pistorius , ever since .
Although the minimum sentence for murder is 15 years , Masipa does have discretion to cut this , or to suspend part of the sentence .
She could , for example , deduct all or part of the original sentence served .
The defence also argued that she ought to make allowance for Pistoriusâ€ ™ disability â€ “ he had both lower limbs amputated as a child â€ “ and his other vulnerabilities , including anxiety , post - traumatic stress disorder and depression .
Oscar Pistorius and his legal team are in the courtroom , along with several members of the Pistorius family .
Barry and June Steenkamp , the parents of Reeva Steenkamp , are also there .
Gerrie Nel , for the state , said the judge had no choice under the law but to start with a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison .
It was not plausible to argue that Pistorius was remorseful when he still has â€œno acceptable explanationâ€
� for why he acted as he did , Nel said .
Nel said that while the defence talked about Pistoriusâ€ ™ suffering , Reeva Steenkamp â€œdisappearedâ€ � : She is just as important as the personal circumstances of the accused â€ ¦
She can never walk in court .
Nel said the â€œbroken manâ€ � in the courtroom was not Pistorius but Barry Steenkamp , Reevaâ€ ™ s father , and that his decision to forgive his daughterâ€ ™ s killer was not a reason for leniency : Forgiveness has more to do with the person forgiving than with the crime .
In a moment of high drama during the sentencing hearing in June , Oscar Pistorius took off his prostheses and walked across the room , grabbing a desk for support .
Defence counsel Barry Roux told the judge : I donâ€ ™ t want to overplay vulnerability â€ ¦
I donâ€ ™ t want to overplay disability â€
¦
It doesnâ€
™ t mean because heâ€ ™ s vulnerable that he can do what he likes .
Thatâ€ ™ s not what we say .
But when weâ€ ™ re entering the field of sentencing , look at that manâ€ ™ s conduct â€ ¦
Please letâ€
™ s understand â€ ¦ who is this man that you must sentence ?
â€œThere is no purpose servedâ€
� by sending Pistorius back to prison , Roux argued , and he should instead perform community service : Punishment is not meant to break the defendant â€ ¦
The accused does not fall into the category of offender who should be removed from society .
Roux said there were â€œserious enemiesâ€ � in the case , including the widely - held perception that Pistorius had intended to kill Steenkamp , and the unwillingness of many people to take into account the circumstances : It was not the man winning gold medals that must be judged â€ ¦
It was a 1.5-metre person , standing on his stumps , three oâ€ ™ clock in the morning when it was dark .
The defence cited the case of rugby player Vleis Visagie , who accidentally killed his daughter and was not prosecuted : How must you feel when you fire those shots that you should not have , and itâ€ ™ s your own girlfriend ?
The facts of the case were not set aside by the supreme court , which upgraded the conviction to murder on a legal point , Roux said .
The original five - year sentence relied on those same facts : he was anxious , vulnerable and afraid ; he did not intend to kill Steenkamp .
The decision to broadcast the trial had not benefitted Pistorius , Roux said : No other accused has ever had to endure this level of publicity , misinformation and character assassination .
Today â€ “ more than three years after Reeva Steenkamp was shot dead â€ “ Oscar Pistorius will be sentenced for her murder .
The former athlete could face up to 15 years in prison , after his original conviction for culpable homicide â€ “ and subsequent five - year sentence â€ “ was overturned on appeal and replaced with a finding that he was guilty of murder .
In a three - day sentencing hearing last month , Judge Thokozile Masipa was told by the defence that â€œthere is no purpose servedâ€ � by sending Pistorius back to prison .
( He previously served 10 months of his original sentence and has lived since September 2015 under house arrest conditions at his uncleâ€ ™ s home in Pretoria . )
But chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel argued that the judge must start at the minimum sentence of 15 years .
The North Gauteng high court in Pretoria is due to convene shortly .

2016-07-21,"South African prosecutors are to appeal against Oscar Pistoriusâ€ ™ s six - year sentence for murdering his girlfriend , Reeva Steenkamp , describing it as â€œshockingly lenientâ€ � , in the latest twist to a legal saga that has attracted worldwide attention .
The national prosecuting authority said it would apply for leave to appeal on Thursday , after saying the sentence was an injustice that had the potential to bring the administration of justice into disrepute .
It said : â€œThe sentence of six yearsâ€ ™ imprisonment , in all the circumstances , is disproportionate to the crime of murder committed [ and ] shockingly too lenientâ€ � .
Judge Thokozile Masipa , who sentenced Pistorius earlier this month , has been criticised by womenâ€ ™ s and other rights groups for accepting the defence argument that a lesser sentence than the 15-year minimum term sought by prosecutor Gerrie Nel was appropriate .
Masipa said she believed there were substantial and compelling reasons for a lesser sentence , including the athleteâ€ ™ s remorse and the fact he believed Steenkamp was an intruder .
Pistorius shot Steenkamp , a model and law graduate , in the early hours of Valentineâ€ ™ s Day in 2013 , saying he mistook her for a burglar when he fired four times through the door of a bathroom .
The original culpable homicide conviction was increased to murder by the supreme court of appeal in December .
When Masipa handed down her decision in Pretoriaâ€ ™ s high court , many thought it was the final chapter in the long - running case .
Supporters of the Steenkamps said at the time â€œthe law has run its courseâ€ � , suggesting they would not seek an appeal .
The family said in a statement on Thursday it had â€œno inputâ€ � in the decision .
â€œJune and Barry
[ Steenkampâ€ ™ s parents ] have always fully supported Gerrie Nel and his teamâ€ ™
s fight for justice for Reeva .
As they have no input in the decision of the state to appeal , they are focusing their energy on the upcoming official media launch of the Reeva Rebecca Steenkamp Foundation on the 19 August 2016 , on what would have been Reevaâ€ ™ s 33rd birthday .
â€œReeva was killed on the same morning she was due to deliver a speech against the abuse of woman , at a school in Johannesburg .
June strives to be Reevaâ€ ™ s voice and continue Reevaâ€ ™ s passion in educating and empowering victims of domestic violence and abuse.â€ � Pistorius , who had the lower part of his legs amputated when he was a baby , was freed from prison last October after almost a year .
He was to serve the remainder of the original five - year term under house arrest at his uncleâ€ ™ s house in a wealthy suburb of Pretoria .
Pistoriusâ€ ™ s sister last week expressed her gratitude to Masipa for her sentencing ruling .
â€œThe thing Iâ€ ™ m most grateful [ for ] , and the thing I really appreciate , is the emphasis she made to distinguish a difference between the facts and the truth in terms of this is not a gender - based violence situation , â€ �
Aimee Pistorius said in an interview with the eNCA television news channel .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a terrible accident , where Oscar had no intention of shooting Reeva.â€
�
In an hour - long judgment , Masipa said the evidence she had heard convinced her Pistorius was not a violent person , was unlikely to reoffend and had shown remorse .
The judge said she had to balance the interests of society , the accused and relatives of the victim .
Pistorius , she said , was â€œa fallen hero , who has lost his career , and been ruined financially .
He can not be at peace.â€ �"
2017-09-04,"Bell Pottingerâ€ ™ s history of chequered clients Lord Bell ,
Margaret Thatcherâ€ ™ s favourite PR man when she was prime minister , co - founded Bell Pottinger in 1987 .
The agency has standard corporate clients , such as the construction group Carillion and the car dealership Lookers , but over the past three decades it has also taken on highly sensitive geo - political PR accounts and other controversial clients .
These include the Pinochet Foundation ; Syriaâ€ ™ s first lady , Asma al - Assad ; the governments of Bahrain and Egypt ; Oscar Pistorius , after he was charged with murder ; FW de Klerk , when he ran against Nelson Mandela for president ; and Alexander Lukashenko , the Belarusian dictator .
It also emerged last year that Bell Pottinger had been paid Â£500 m to make propaganda videos in Iraq on behalf of the US government .
They included short news segments made to look like Arabic news networks and fake insurgent videos .
Key players in the South Africa scandal The Guptas and the Zumas - the Zuptas
The wealthy , powerful and controversial Guptas have been described as â€œthe most hated family in South Africaâ€ � .
The Gupta brothers moved from India to South Africa in 1993 and developed a very close relationship with Jacob Zuma and his family , becoming billionaires along the way .
They have been widely accused of using ties to Zuma to influence government decisions .
Zumaâ€ ™ s son , Duduzane , has been a director of several Gupta - owned companies as well as working for Oakbay , the business at the centre of the scandal .
The Guptas started out with a computer business , but over 25 years have developed a conglomerate that includes coal and uranium mines , air travel , energy and manufacturing , a TV station and a national newspaper .
Victoria Geoghegan The 34-year - old was Bell Pottingerâ€ ™ s partner leading the Gupta account .
Geoghegan met Duduzane Zuma to discuss and ultimately run what would ultimately become the â€œeconomic emancipationâ€ � campaign .
As the scandal escalated a Facebook campaign with pictures of her and the word â€œwantedâ€ � appeared .
Geoghegan was a high flyer at the firm she joined 12 years ago .
As recently as December she was still rapidly climbing the corporate ladder , being appointed managing director of Bell Pottingerâ€ ™ s financial and corporate division .
She resigned from Bell Pottinger on 6 July , when she was seven months pregnant and due to go on maternity leave .
The same day the PR agency issued an â€œunequivocal and absoluteâ€ � apology for the campaign .
James Henderson Henderson was one of the engineers of the Â£20 m management buyout of the Bell Pottinger PR business from parent company Chime , alongside Lord Bell , when it was taken over by WPP and the US equity firm Providence Equity Partners in 2012 .
He took the role of chief executive and is the largest individual shareholder in the PR business .
He maintains he knew nothing about the South Africa campaign , but stood down on Sunday , saying that â€œas chief executive I have ultimate executive responsibility for Bell Pottingerâ€ � .
Lord Bell Bell left the PR agency that carries his name last summer .
He has since said that one of the reasons he decided to leave was his unease over the Oakbay account .
Bellsaid his warnings that the Gupta account was â€œsmellyâ€ � were ignored by senior management he told , including Henderson .
The agency has reportedly denied he voiced his concerns .
Ever the risk - taker , when Bell quit the firm last year he immediately set up a new business called Sans Frontieres , the same name as the arm of Bell Pottinger that handled sometimes controversial geo - political work ."
